    "text": " Hey, this is Derei and welcome to Pause For The People. On this episode it's me, Kaya Miles and Dior, talking about all the news that you don't know from the past week. The news that went under-reported was regarding Derei's justice and equity. Then I sat down with one and only Daniel Hatcher to talk about his new book In Justice Inc. How America's Justice is to commodify his children and the poor. Y'all, I learned so much from this book. Everybody needs to read it right now. I can't wait for you to hear this interview. We're going to, it's like inform my organizing. Learn to time. So, can't wait for you to hear this. Here we go. Family, happy spring and welcome to another episode of Pause Save The People. I am Diora Ballinger. You can find me on Instagram at Diora Ballinger. I'm Miles D. Johnson. You can find me on Instagram and Twitter at Farrow Rapture. I'm Kaya Henderson at Henderson Kaya on Twitter. And this is Derei at Diora on Twitter. After recording on the first day of spring, it's the spring equinox, a time for change, a time for evolution. And Donald Trump is about to evolve himself into the penitentiary, everybody. Oh, Lloyd, today's show. You know that's not real. Isn't that real? It's not real. It's not real. You're about to take a full out of me all excited and a person dying. I've grown Diora since last few years. Diora Trump posted on social media. I don't even know what social media Donald Trump. I don't even know where he lives. They've reinstated him to all of these different things, right? How many restored his accounts? It is. So, he posted that he's going to be arrested Tuesday of this week. And the claim, this claim has come out while still a New York prosecutor is considering charging Donald Trump in connection with hush money. He paid to an adult film actress, Stormy Daniels. This is, we're talking about the former president of the United States. So in the midst of all the other January 6th stuff, he also has a, he got cases, y'all. He got another penitent case. Around Stormy Daniels. So he's entangled in several criminal investigations, but the case related to Daniels as the longest running goes all the way back to 2016. So on his platform, Truth Social, gag. On Saturday morning, he said that there were some illegal leaks that indicated he would be arrested on Tuesday. I love how like I'm everybody. Thorough you are about this. Like this is the whole thing is trash. Like this is trash. That man just told the people I'm about to get arrested on Tuesday. Y'all need to protest. Y'all need to tear the place up. This is, look, this year all like nice and legal and thorough and thoughtful about this. This dude is inciting the next insurrection around his rightful accountability for payments to his porn star mistress. Come on, y'all. This is the worst of America. Okay, you had a, listen, you had to put that stink on it. Cause that is what's happening. So my question is, my question is, do you think that this is really, if you clever enough that this is really going to happen, mind you all, we're recording this on Monday. So this is either Christmas Eve or nine. Or you get, or you get. Right. So are we either, is he either saying this in order to show the people who are prosecuting him how much power he has to maybe make them think again about doing legal action and be like, oh, this is what he'll do. We're scared. Or do we think that he's not that clever? It is probably actually going to happen. And he's just wailing. You know, I'm like wondering if he's just like, I'm like poking them back. I think what makes me nervous about the whole thing is that this thing is now taking place in New York City. Right. So he would have to appear in a Manhattan court. And so I would assume the both the best visual is a protest at that court, which is where we live. So I think. Ain't nobody scared of that. I'll go to Capitol grill. I sure will and be right there. This is my turf. Y'all ain't about to chump me out of my turf. Nope. I don't not care. Insurrect this. I'll be right there with my chopsticks, eat your food and watch a him get arrested. And I wish y'all would. He's not going to he is not going to perp walk it through the thing like regular people. He's going to backdoor the attorney's office and blah blah blah. But here's the thing, right? Like this is it would be different if his first indictment was around something really substantive, like, you know, the Georgia election stuff or the documents at Mar-a-Lago or the insurrection on January 6. But this is this is highly problematic because it is against the loss, like campaign finance laws or whatever is a sort of a tricky case. But this is like personal stuff, right? And he is using this to rally his base to be like, look at these people. They are persecuting me at every turn. And this is why I am the right choice to lead this country because we got to take America back, make it great again or whatever his crapple is. And so like the Republicans are using this. Kevin McCarthy. Like all of the people are like, this is terrible. This is an abusive power, blah blah blah blah blah. And this is all rallying his base to get at him, right? The Republicans are putting pressure on Ron to Santas State. Like you better say something. Like this is a moment for him. And you know, I think the Manhattan DA's office is not fully understanding the role that they might be playing in inadvertently giving him an opportunity to re-emass some power. Right. And you know, through who we just in January 6 part of what we discovered, I mean, we already knew this, but a lot of NYPD were in January 6 and our Trump supporters. So I'm off again. It's like this somebody called National Guard. I don't feel safe. I do not feel safe. Come on over, come on. Now, if I were in DC where I knew how to get down, yes, but you know. It is also for me. I'll say one of the things that I am reminded of is just how much of a frenzy Trump had us in at the height of Trump. Like this would have been wall to wall coverage. We would like, like when Trump was really Trump and it was like, so even the idea that he could say this and I saw it in passing on Twitter, which is like a breath of fresh air that this was not like the only thing people were talking about. Because y'all know that there was a moment where like every time Trump would do something, it was like the only thing in the room. I always think about those four years as like the American dream. I think of it as like the American fever dream. And I do think out of all if there's like any quote unquote good that the Trump cycle did for me as an individual was it it thicken my skin to distraction and it kind of in and maybe kind of create my own intellectual priority. So it wasn't just the president said something or this is happening. So I take it seriously. It just did. That's just not how things work like work in my head anymore because during Trump's height, Trump's height, you just couldn't take everything he said seriously or you're going to go, you're going to part because he lied like a zillion and a half time. Right. Precisely. So you just couldn't do that. I think every but starting today though, it's going to be. Yeah, we are wearing up. Yeah. Like this is it's going to be on TV all day long to starting today. So we'll see. Let me go ahead and pay my cable bill. I thought you were going down the Capitol Grill tomorrow. Come on. I mean, it's going to be something. It's going to be something might be small. I was talking about today. That's Christmas day activities. Christmas Eve activities is I'm going to pay them. I'm watching some CNN and see who's on there now and the army legend. Legend. So a soul legend by we call well has passed away. You know, a beautiful statement came out the day that he passed away letting us know. I think the agreed on analysis or feeling amongst at least black folks is that he is will live in perpetuity as the person who's saying with so much soul that you could not believe that he was a white man when you saw him. And I love and of course we all love that we all love that song. But then also of course, when people have passed away, you kind of dig into stuff hits common. And I'm trying to request that he there's so many people who have sampled his music and I did not know that his music was the backbone to so many of my already favorite hip-hop songs. Commons the Light. Oh my goodness. Just such a beautiful record. And he he he was like super supportive of rappers sampling his song, right? Like I saw some of the coverage this week where he was like, Oh my God, I guess common call to ask him if he could sample. And he was like, I would be honored if you if you sampled my song, like, which is not usually what you hear. It's an innovative take because you have to know that sampling is literally giving your song another life to another generation. And it also shows the humility that that that that Bobby had when it came to his work because at some point you have to understand that your work no longer belongs to you and it becomes another shoe for artists to play with. And it becomes another color for artists to play with when they're paintings. And that's part of the legacy of hip-hop music and soul music and I'm playing black music and electronic music. And it's just so cool that he that he knew about that. I saw a video of him in in older years singing and he that voice was still voicing that. Oh, let me tell you something. Let me tell you something. I got a man but of Bobby Caldwell type of white man coming since like that. I'm just saying I'm on team Sonny for the record. No, that would never in an alternative parallel universe. If I was still in the market, I would definitely say, okay, I could open it up to you just got to have soul, but the Bobby Caldwell of it all. I love it. So my news is I've been going to the garbage bin for my news for the last two weeks. So maybe I'll do something a little bit more elevated next week, but when trash calls, I must answer. So this root article that I put in is about Lil Nas X, how he apologizes the trans community after sending a controversial tweet. So some of the different points that I wanted to hit. So hopefully I'll hit them all if I don't. Yeah, let me. But the original post was Lil Nas X, post a picture of a woman and then says, hey, I transitioned. The surgery went well. He receives backlash because it kind of trivializes the the the the the the trajectory and the the narrative and also just makes it makes a mockery is the best where I can think of of the narrative of a lot of trans folks experiences. And then people can also connect to this to the People magazine article that he has or the photo shoot that he has where he's pregnant. And he's like, like he's he's the man, but he's pregnant and kind of makes a mockery of that because that's the actual situation that many trans men are in. And that's just a that's a regular trans experience in him making a mockery of it kind of continues to other it instead of trying to make people who aren't maybe as privy to trade experiences. See it as normal or see it as another mode of life. But when you kind of make a mockery of it, it's like it becomes a gag. So that happens. We all make mistakes. I've said some really silly things as well. Just I'm sure yesterday. I was going to say when I was younger, but I'm like, I'm sure yesterday I said some silly things as well. And so that there were jokes. So he gets backlash, he apologizes. Then somebody who's of the trans community comes back and says, Hey, cool, you apologize, but you're also a socially financially powerful person. So a verbal apology from somebody who has much power that you have in the community really doesn't mean much. So you should actually apologize with your wallet and with your social status, meaning you should donate to a mutual aid transfer. You should donate to do something beyond just just sending out a tweet about it really support it really support the trans community. He responds with girl, eat my I can't say the other thing. Eat mom eat my booty booty. He responds with that. My jaw was on the floor because not only was I like, okay, you shouldn't say that's disrespectful. But then also I'm like really trying to map out how do you think that you apologize to somebody? How do you think that you that you're a part of the community? And then you then go back and actually attack a member of the same community. That made no absolutely no sense to me and made me see how just disingenuous the original apology was. It really disappointed me. I'm going to be honest with you. Not a huge little not X fan. I definitely think he is great for the children and great for the community or maybe I should say was, but it made me really sad. I think the other thing that made me even more sad is as somebody, you know, my background was I've written for New York Times and Vice and you know, essence and blah, blah, blah. I could not find anybody interested in me pushing back on that last response. Even as I was researching things, people were so quick to cover. He made a mistake and apologize. Nobody was interested in me pushing back and saying on a Twitter account that has millions of followers, he then humiliated a black trans woman just after he apologized. That was just peculiar to me and the cynical part of me wanted to think that, oh, nobody's interested in me holding accountable this celebrity because one day he could be used to recreate their start on them and give them more views or give them more clicks. It was just static silence when I was trying to push those things back or just clear rejection knows. I'm just me doing the math in my head on social. I'm like, well, we know this will give you. We know people are talking about it. So this is actually just an attack on dissenting content and critical content when it comes to celebrity, which is a thing that I've been singing and I've been talking about a lot that I just have been seeing happen more and more and more of. Where can people really distinct around celebrity, specifically black culture and black celebrity right now? I wanted to bring this to the podcast. I will again, anytime I see something that happens that is transphobic, I love to talk about it because I think that inside the black community, we need to continue to talk about transness and transphobia and really start normalizing that conversation because that's how you got it and that's how we that's how we transcend it. So yeah, I wanted to bring this all to you. What do you think? Did you see it? Did you have more than a life than I did and you missed it? What happened? You know, the day that I think confuses me when when megastars do stuff like this is just how many people are required to participate to pull it off, right? You can't like the original outfit and moment, you don't just like stumble into this moment, like the photo, all this stuff. So I was hopeful that he'd have more critical friends and not critical as in like constructive criticism, but like who understood critical stuff around gender and identity because he's been such a the forefront of owning his own gayness. Owning his own. What? Gayness, gayness, gayness. I heard a completely different word. I never like you could say that on the phone now. Gayness? Yes, I got it. Thanks. And I it's so interesting to like it's like the human part of it where I could see him being like, you know, somebody popped off on me on Twitter and I didn't sell like you have so many more followers. And this is like, this just brings on a swath of people that hate somebody who just has way less social standing. So I left it all just disappointed. That's I don't have anything deep to say besides I'm like, come on, Lil Nas X, you've had such a good run. I'm disappointed in this. It doesn't feel like we don't have like celebrity. We heart like we hardly have celebrities anymore. It feels like we don't have artists and public intellectuals anymore. To me, it feels like we have mascots. And I think that these moments really highlight the fact that we have mascots because if you were in the position to embrace your queerness and you and you got there because of something that was deeper than kind of a shallow identity politic, you would probably have something critical to say or some deep reflection or some advancement when this situation happens. But when you get there, just because people need feel like they need a mascot for their identity team, then you get really disappointed during times like this because there's just no depth beyond the identity portion. I hate to blame this on generational issues, but I think that is part to blame here. I, you know, growing up with Janet Jackson knew I just I feel like partly growing up pop music in that time. It was the evolution of pop of black pop music. I would say there was more community in terms of accountability around that artist, whether it was Prince, whether I just I feel like there was more accountability. There was even more desire from that artist to want to make a community proud. I mean, I'm not talking about like, I'll be sure, but you know, I think for a large. Hey, hey, that's my fellow Mount Vernon. I don't don't appreciate him on the money. Of course, he's from Mount Vernon. Of course, of course, he's from Mount Vernon. That's right. But all that, but all that to say, I think there was there was a certain attention paid to making your community proud and like all the things that that means. I completely disagree. I think well, let me let me finish. Let me finish. I also feel like part of it is capitalism was a lot different growing up than it is now social media capitalism. How so much is a reflection of what you have, how big your platform is and being credentialing yourself to speak on things which you actually have no insight, education whatsoever. Right. So now everybody is an expert on everything. And so I feel like part of this is Lil Nas X, whose name is Monteiro named after a Mitsubishi Monteiro who grew up in the projects is 23 years old was gay coming up and who knows where Georgia. Part of this is he has his own set of traumas which we know we understand. But now he's in a community. Like I'm finding that his one of his best friends is Miley Cyrus. Like if that is your community of people that you're around and therefore understanding levers of accountability from, you're actually not accountable to anybody. Right. If you're not seeing yourself as like, you know, trying to make the black community proud through who you are and what all that means, especially for him being queer. But you're just out there being who you want to be, no accountability to anybody. You can say what you want, talk crazy to whomever. I just see, I see this as a larger, a larger reflection of what culture means now in this country, of what communication now means in this country, of what engagement looks like in this country and how it's, it's just more acceptable to be disrespectful. And it's more acceptable to say, this is how I feel and I don't care what you feel about it. I think it's a long convoluted way of saying, you know, like I think I think there are a lot of things at play here. And I guess I put a responsibility on him, but I also just think it is the the hurricane in which he is growing up in. I agree with you on communication and engagement being very different. I don't necessarily agree on an accountability thing. I just think that people didn't have access to, to pop stars, you know, back in the day, the way they do now. And half of the pop stars that we love are as crazy as everybody else's. We just didn't know because they weren't tweeting. They weren't, they didn't say everything that was on their mind. And we, if they did, we didn't have access to it. Right. And so I think part of the problem with these high levels of engagement and no filters and complete and total access to people is you get all the day stuff. You get the good, the bad and the ugly. You get them being young and making mistakes. You get them not understanding what real apology looks like. For me, like this is so interesting because like, you know, the last thing in this article miles it was somebody saying, how come all of this vitriol is not directed to the lawmakers who are actually passing these anti trans laws, right? Like the burden that we put on a burden and responsibility, whatever it is, I guess if you get the fame, you also get the responsibility. But like we are, we are much quicker to go after. You know, what I, what I sometimes feel are just young people out here being young, right? I put back on that because I think that, you know, this is going to sound hella able or excuse me, this is going to sound extremely able is, but most people can yell at little Nas X and say you got that wrong and do and do the other thing too. And I feel like that was such a. I agree. I agree with that they can. But if you look on their Twitter accounts, they not out blasting Ron DeSantis, they not out doing whatever, whatever they are saving it all for. Like we eat, we eat our own. We go to the places that are closest for us to attack and like there's not a court and there's not always a coordinated effort to go after the people causing us pain. And I'm not saying little Nas X is off the hook by any stretch of the imagination. I'm saying we need to be doing both and and it's too easy for us to, I guess, attack the celebrities than to do the other stuff. I think they're all everyone's living in that same bubble though, where there isn't personally necessarily perspective on that. It. Again, it is, it's being cute. This is what it's about. It's about being cute and being seen. Do you, are you getting cookies for knowing who Ron DeSantis is? Hail to the no. You being cute, you being out here in the scene and then it's a conversation with and amongst folks that aren't necessarily paying attention to these greater issues. And I'm sounding like a real auntie here, but I think that's part of what it is on the internet. I was, I've talked about this with the Ray a lot. Like I do, I do think there's an interesting flattening of people who are in the public. And I think that when we think about celebrity and fame and I think about it a lot and I think about it just one of the things that fascinate me and that like in my work, I just like excavate. Like when I think about it, there is like flattening of celebrity right now, but when celebrity first started, television is not that new. Having a personal television in your home is not that new. You had different silos of celebrity and in order to maybe collapse two types of celebrities, so AKB a public intellectual or be a political leader and be a sports star, you have to kind of earn your stripes to be able to do that thing. If you wanted to be a little Richard and you wanted to be a rock star and be on stage and you also wanted to say something towards the black community or say something towards political standings. You have to earn your stripes and do that. Now, and we're in this like homogenous like weird thing where everybody is everything. So sometimes you'll have somebody who's a makeup influencer who is great and pretty and whatever, but then she maybe discovered that about colorism yesterday and now all of a sudden we're listening to her talk about colorism and because everything's so flat, we could really be contending with her views on colorism and the public sphere for longer than it's needed. And then to your point is we can be talking about political lawmakers and little nots expert on the internet and how media is made. All those things feel just as important as each other because they're all happening at the same volume at the same time. And sometimes it can feel like a little nots ex because he's your same identity. He's closer to you, more of your friends like him and he's playing play at your party. I can feel more intimate and important than a political lawmaker because of how culture and music touch us. So turn off your television. And Miles is being alright because Twitter has been all in and up for about white casting and white presenting because somebody tweeted it and it is we are in hell on Twitter about it. Yeah, it's just interesting so as much as we talk about like where bald wind might have got it wrong or where the big thing that I was glad that people started talking about was Alice Walker's anti-Semitism and places where she's been transphobic. There was other places where it came to theory that Alice Walker gained her stripes which is the reason why we even care what Alice Walker thinks. Which is totally different than what I think is going on now. Don't go anywhere. More positive people's coming. So my news is about banking and it is not even new news but as we think about SBB collapsing and it's also taking down credit Swiss if you haven't seen. I don't know. We talked about this a little bit but one of the ways that they are saying SVP like one of the reasons why it collapsed was because of the wokeness on the board. And then you look at the board of SVP and it is all white people. But one of the Republican lines has been like they were so focused on diversity efforts that like they weren't focused on running the business and definitely just a racist trope. And then I am on Twitter and I come across the only black CEO in banking. This article about him and I am sufficiently intrigued. He at one point was at a party, a birthday party for somebody when the like president or guy and a black performer came on stage dressed as a janitor and began to dance to music while sweeping the floor. So TM got up and left because you know that's insane. Another group of the chairman of the board's friends come out and they're all wearing afros. You're like okay now we're just being racist. And there were all these other racist moments that he had to contend with and then he eventually gets ousted because his number two ordered investigators to spy employees and like obviously you can't do that. And it was one of those things where it was like this guy has done everything. He checked every box, been every school, had every experience and still in the highest rooms people are saying he is a third world kid and you know they're having I couldn't imagine being at that role and having somebody come out dressed as a janitor and doing show tunes. And it was just such a reminder of the legacy institutions in this country like being the representative person who breaks through is not is not only not freedom or solidarity. You're still contending with the same thing that that somebody in the not highest levels is dealing with at their job too. And seeing this I was like wow this is this is something else. I would love to see black banking like one of the I don't know I just it I brought this up because I a didn't I don't remember this guy. And I was like you know he's done all this stuff and still can't escape blackface in afro is at the party. The reason why I remember this is because we we were talking about how black people are brought in to clean up people's messes and the credit Suisse was in a like downward spiral at this point and they hired this dude because he is the best at what he does. And he actually saved credit Suisse back when he was running he was there for five years. Cray saved it brought it out of a spiral but he was so black and so not Swiss and so whatever it wasn't even that he was so black it was that they were so white they were like yeah like we can't have this and they fired him like your company is drowning the man saves it and you fire him because he's black and this for all of the people who talk about meritocracy and let markets work and capitalism and blah blah blah it's all a crock anti blackness running rampant all over the place even when we are demonstrating our our most excellent performance even when we save your capitalist banks you still throw us out and make us feel terrible about being black. I remember this vividly and I think poo poo credit Suisse you threw out the savior that you had and now here you are getting bought up by UBS season. It's also just fascinating because it's such a different type of racism. When I was at the State Department I had to plan an event with the French like the people of France and my phone calls with them were so bizarre by bizarre I mean racist and I remember one of the he was literally like a diplomat I remember him saying to me your last name is French and I was like yeah you know because you know what happened over here right and he was. He seems forgot. What? What? But it was it but it was it's so it's it was so different from American racism right. It's like we've perfected a very violent aggressive type of racism here but in Europe it is really really it's like these fine fine lines that are so like brilliantly and meticulously placed in everyday interactions right in ways that like it was even harder to like I would it would sting and I would feel it but I'm like what did that just what what it so you give me an example I'm curious. And what do you do to push back in that kind of because I do think you're right that like we are primed for a very in your face racism you know. It it was. For example okay so. What we were planning so we were planning this is when the earthquake had happened in Haiti. In 2010 and so we were planning a donors conference in Martinique so we were bringing Haitian mayors and mayors really from around the world that had gone through some type of like major natural disaster. And so the French were like our co hosts in the planning of this and so we're doing this in Martinique but because most of the attendance were participants were black the approach to it had like a certain like a silliness to like that we were we were being silly or we were being. We were being too cautious or we were being too too over prepared around what this thing was going to look like. And so it just felt like. Being on the phone with you know being on the phone with someone who really doesn't care about an event it's an event they're co hosting but like they could care less right and so it was every every way to. To sort of under the cuff demean me demean the you know the my boss at the time who was who was leading this. So it was just like little things like and I think the last name thing was a thing I remember most vividly because it was like in the middle of a planning like it was it was such an inappropriate thing to bring up it wasn't like we had established a relationship it wasn't like we were being chatty or personable one another it was like oh so your last name sounds French it's a very ancient French name. What what the hell does that mean? Anywho you know what I'm saying it was one of those things that there's like such an air of like something I don't even understand that it just was like I don't know it's probably how Megan was feeling I should have talked about it so bad but yeah it was one of those things. Right. That you're just like like it goes over your head you're like what did what happened to you? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I get it now. That was a that was a what a text to life connection you know. I had like a very like I don't know you want to call it a microphone about one of the things that I've been so I have in order to like really explain this well I have a confession to make I've been watching Fox News and for research purposes and then I watched after I watched because I was watching like the Jesse Smolley documentary and then after I was watching that I like watched Rodeon bars and newest stand up and maybe just because I'm young and even though I've been talking about race and power and whiteness and blackness and blah blah blah for a long time there's still things that I still that just like you know what it's Oprah saying it was it was aha moment in my head and she was there doing her stand up act and she was talking making her jokes and so many of the jokes even though they may have been filled with anti blackness or anti anti progressive thoughts or whatever so much of it was really about her getting the white liberal elites that she felt were getting like that that she was attacking and me watching it and I got hit with strays like really her actual who she was really trying to attack were or she really cared about with these white liberals and because I was watching it I was getting hit with strays and I thought about this when reading this article was I wonder how much of that stuff would have still happened even if he wasn't there all those racist things would have still happened even if he wasn't there just because their their goal is to maybe make uncomfortable the people the other people who are forcing them into a more liberal or new way of thinking that they don't want it they want it that they don't want to embrace and their rebellion against it with these these horrendously like racist acts like that's that's kind of the tension I was like feeling to where I'm like I think this would be happening I don't like I wasn't I he caught he got the mean because he was witnessing it but also I think that would have happened whether he was in the room or not and I think that yes it was also this celebration of white supremacy but also it was to make other people uncomfortable who were white because they're playing this kind of tennis game about where whiteness should go and how it should be seen should be seen as all conservative and racist or new progressive and quietly racist and that and sometimes you get caught in the in the tennis match of that as a black person and it's about you but you're just another ball that they're willing to hit it's you're you're not even seen as an actual opponent even when you're helping the company survive like in this case well thank goodness my news today is on the lighter side everyone it's from the New York Times it's from a couple of weeks ago but I came across it a couple of days ago and for those who don't know I am obsessed with home interiors like obsessed and this is inspired by my granny Dorothy black some of my aunties my to teary my to read a Monty Chaya there was always like a religious pride to like what was in the home what the home looked like but then also making sure that you did something or took a nice enough photo for somebody for you to find yourself in one of these homes right there was always like a sense of belonging and how I grew up so anyhow so this the headline of this is interior lives of black homes it's part of like a series in the New York Times in the design section for the recent push of diversity and design and how that makes the world look different the story begins with Helen C Mabel Ecklen the self-described soul queen of southern cuisine so in the in this in the in the article there's a photo and she is on the steps of her field stone house on the south side of Chicago and she got on black mink and she looked fabulous okay so it's 1974 this house which was commissioned in 1965 from the architect Milton M Swartz it was a bold and glamorous place to be so she she entertained folks like Martin Luther King Mahalia Jackson Muhammad Muhammad Ali and so just to get like a picture of this so there's she's standing there there's a recess portico they're double entrance doors a sky lighted shack carpeted living room which has her baby white grand piano of course she died in 2009 in the house remained under her family's ownership until just last year. Bertina Power who's an author in a real estate broker was approached and asked when asked asked for her professional advice on whether to rehab rehab the property or sell it she took one look at the place and said well I'm gonna buy it she's also a sister she's a you know entrepreneur and she believed that her owning this house was her fate which she didn't know was the history that went with this house so the backdrop of this is after decades of neglect black interiors spaces designed for and buy black homeowners are receiving new attention they're being documented analyzed and publications exhibitions and research initiatives. Some of the houses aren't as striking as and as modern as Miss Helen's house but there is such an incredible and deep and rich story of black people seeking identity and comfort at home. This question of black aesthetics is ambiguous according to Dinesia Monet Malone who recently introduced her My Black Home project as part of her PhD research and critical geography studies at Temple. Miss Malone asked residents in Indianapolis her formal home to answer the question if somewhere were to walk in your home what element what element of it would make them say this is a black home. As I was reading this I turned to pal and I said pal do you think our home is a black home? She said well what do you think? I said well absolutely. Pal is a smart lady. What are you doing? We're even as like even as we're doing the podcast I mean if you look at even our little boxes in our homes it's like obviously eclectic black art you know what I'm saying? Yeah that is fascinating because I got nervous when I asked myself does my home look like black home? When I read your article for sure. So faith Lindsay who's also a researcher in this space is like it's exhilarating to see how people interpret home right how their dresser is staged their kitchen a wall of memories they really capture the mundane things that might go unnoticed by someone else. Catherine E. McKinley who's an author and curator and does you know has a book called A Letter From Home she's working on and I can't wait to see this book. A Letter From Home The Art and Science of Black Homemaking and in this book will be Zenobia Bailey who amaze. If you all don't know Zenobia Bailey's work please please go seek it out. She's an American fine artist designer super naturalist cultural activist and fiber artist best known for her like a collective crochet like she makes these massive hats. Terry Atkins who's an another American artist pioneered the body of work that Blanche Sculpture sound performance video printmaking Sun Ra the musician jazz composer amaze so there's going to be you know kind of the household objects of all of these folks. Now the contrast is is a woman by the name of Sheila Pre-Brite who did a suburbia portfolio in 2006 which is part of the collection at the National Museum of African American History and Culture. She's an Atlanta based photographer she produces work that is stark and uncluttered airy in the way of typical interior design magazine photography. She's a visual storyteller and she said when she got to Atlanta she noticed that so many black folks were living in the suburbs and she wanted to highlight that when she went to publishers they were like well these houses don't look like black people live in them. Where are the TVs? What? Oh god y'all get all my nerves. We got the frame we got the frame so my TV looks like art and there's black art in it and it's only a TV when I turn it on because we want to come up I'm just saying there you go there you go. You know so this this article it's just amazing like I could literally just go through the whole thing verbatim I just was obsessed with it but I think what what I wanted to highlight around it is just this concept of black home making and I think it's something that no matter what you have materially it was such a point a pride and also so visceral of how we appoint things and how we care for things and how we bring who we are into our spaces and what was also interesting in this is the conversation on modernism and Admit Sentry design and how that design was meant to keep people out right where we turn that on it's head like we often do and we used it to bring people in so if you looked at you know jet magazine and Ebony magazine interiors and designs were always meant to include and include and and just exude community so I just thought this piece was fascinating and and really highlights how much of a role we just play in our destinies like no matter what is happening out in the world and what is oppressing us and all of that it's just these something as simple as making whatever you can beautiful in your way how critical that's been to us as a culture and how and how strong of a culture we have in that so I hope you all enjoy this one it's just I thought it was fabulous I'm obsessed with this article I as you were speaking of course I was listening to you but also I was buying the book that was listed here called Afro Chic Afro Spell with a PH Chic and I'm so excited to get it it's going to be delivered tomorrow this is one of the most important things to me because I feel like when it comes to owning feeling at home someplace that was just not a freedom that was given to a lot of black people and before like you can ask my boyfriend when we moved in here we have boxes and everything was literally decorated maybe within the first 48 hours that we came because I was like no I have to feel part of me feeling like I'm planting roots in a space is me decorating it me coming up with like concepts it's an extremely ancestral even spiritual experience for me to be in Brooklyn being flatbush be in this um written control apartment and have each bedroom home kind of speak towards who I am and even like as I'm sitting here this is like the smallest room in the apartment but I have pictures of myself juxtaposed with pictures from the 1940s but then also I have like a little Kim Harkora again I have a TLC picture frame that's outside of the frame and those things are so intentional because I really wanted to feel consumed or voured by the colors and the culture and the family ancestry that I grew up with and I feel like we don't talk about that enough and I love looking through the pictures that they did provide and seeing how many of those like I just got a little fuzzy feeling because I have how many of those spaces look like my space and it feels like even though I didn't know this existed there is this other frequency that we're all on when it comes to creating our homes and and making so it does feel like a black home and sometimes the things aren't as blatant as you know a racist trouble like where's the TVs the there's there's other things that you just intuitively intuitively feel where like oh I know the black person in the history of this black person who lives here and then also the last thing that I'll say is I was looking at these homes and I'm like well chah definitely dreamed about living in the sky and wanting this penthouse or whatever is that a lot of times at least in my home the homes of black people is also aspirational so you could also see the dreams of where that person wants to go and where you want with where that person wants to um land and I think that is such a beautiful thing where you could step in somebody's home and see their past but then also see where they're trying to manifest their future and the tension between that and then working out through design I love love love love love love love but this article this topic could talk about it forever um thanks for bringing us Ciara this was really interesting to me for a couple reasons the main reason is um it points to like we've talked a lot about the humanization of black people like we don't see pictures of black people recreating we don't see pictures of black people's homes because the larger society doesn't want you to think that we're normal that we value interior design you pick up an interior design book like I bought I don't know what it was uh somebody's I'm sure it was architectural digest I'm sure right never bought architectural digest before but I bought it because Viola Davis's um house was on the cover and I wanted to see her house right like they don't show our homes they don't they and it is a real clear um assault on black society to say you know you live different than we live and your life your homes your interiors your spaces are not worthy of our time and attention and so reclaiming that narrative and showing black homes I think is an important step in the continued evolution of black people in America so thank you for that um and I do remember like in the ebony in the jet you would see people's you know stuff and then like your people would be like oh we got to go get a couch like you know Janet Jackson or we got right like totally aspirational yes indeed and so I I really appreciate that I also like I said you know when I saw the question like if somebody walked in your home when they know it was black I literally was like I think so um and I was like you know I got to make this space a little more black right and so I have a friend who is an amazing um she's an educator but interior design is her side passion and she posts pictures of her um of her home online all the time and it is show enough black and the last time she posted something I was like girl I gotta get you over here because we got to rework some of this space I needed to be blacker and this just reminded me I need to call her today because we gonna chocolate up this thing even more than what it currently is um because that makes me feel comfortable and then that made me think about the tension right between having black spaces and you know we've covered a lot on the podcast about these like home appraisals right that when you want to sell your house and maximize your asset if the house looks too black you gonna get a uh an undervalued assessment right and so this tension between living the way we want to live and and using the master's tools to get ahead right real estate a house is the American dream you can sell your house and leverage whatever that our blackness and our living black actually works against us in that so this brought up a host of issues for me and I ain't scared I'm about to blacken it up a little bit more and after I do we gonna have a little pod saved a people party um right down here in northeast DC in my more black house okay more black because that's what it is okay um my news this week is about the continue to salt on women by the republican party sorry to end on a low note job but you got to know what's going on out in the place it's ridiculous what is happening I mean we thought it was the end of the world when you know roby wade was overturned and these republicans continue to show us that uh nope it ain't over just when you thought uh it couldn't get worse it is getting worse um ronda santis is pushing um I guess a bill that will prohibit young ladies in elementary school from uh talking about their period um I guess you can talk about it from sixth grade through twelfth grade but god forbid you get your period in third or fourth or fifth grade which many of our young women do you can't talk about it in school um there's an oklahoma woman who is convicted of manslaughter because she had a miscarriage um and oklahoma has sentenced her to four years in jail um and so you know terrible to have a miscarriage and to go through that trauma but then to get convicted and go to jail because of that is a whole nother thing and then south carolina in an effort to not be outdone um their republican lawmakers have proposed um the death penalty for women who have abortions yes the death penalty in the south carolina prenatal equal protection act of 2023 it makes a person who gets an abortion eligible for the death penalty by making a fertilized egg a quote unquote person and so that egg now has equal protection under homicide laws and they are pushing um to prosecute well they are pushing to pass this bill which will allow them to prosecute women who have abortions there is an exception for mothers who are facing imminent threat of death or great bodily injury but there is no exception for rape or incest um these are people who are supposed to be pro-life right so they're gonna kill people kill mothers people who make life um if they don't have the babies that they want them to have or whatever like i i don't get this this it continues a trend of laws in republican led states that limit not only limit access to abortion but they punish people um since the fall of ro v weighed um 18 states have imposed near or total abortion bans and um yeah it just does not stop i i will honestly say um i i am i'm trying to connect the dots because none of these things are unrelated all of these things taken together right like if you can we're talking about this these lighthouse moments where if you can get one thing here or one thing there the republicans have been quite adept at taking that thing and then run in the playbook through a bunch of other states and so i think you'll you know if they can get this in south carolina then coming to a republican led state me or you will be to death penalty for anybody who gets abortions you know it's the texas judge who is about to make a decision that will impede the abortion drug for the entire um for the entire country right and and and so this like full frontal assault on women women's bodies women's agency and freedom um i i i i i want to know republican women what what are you all out here doing what what's going on what what is this um we knew it was coming again like i can't watch um oh lua what's the series on hulu did i have the handmade tail i had to stop watching the handmade tail because this is the like lead up right to the handmade tail which we never thought could happen but is about to happen and so i'm bringing this to the pod because like you know we have to keep a watchful eye on all of these things and connect the dots for what is happening um around women and women's rights in this country i don't really have much else to say absolutely deplorable to your um i got questioned and reporting i don't i don't liking myself to like be able to report on what like conservative republican women are thinking but during my fox news research a joke about uh the uh these laws around um women's bodies was made and it was like well don't worry because you can't get pregnant because you took the vaccine so i think that even though that was a joke i think that that actually says a lot around the cognitive dissonance that uh conservative women republican women are willing to um adapt in order to make sure that the people the men who they're running with or remain in power or get more power or accumulate more power is that you just make up these lies and these tropes in your head that's totally um make it all right whatever is going on and make it not that serious and it's that serious i think that that's i think that a lot of times we're seeing as like overreacting when we say when we talk about things like this or we see we seem um like we're just um exaggerating something but it's no it's really that serious and law by law things are being taken taken away so we are going to be looking like the handmaid's tail and you have to take the first thing just as serious as the 100th thing or before you know it you're in something where can get between the Jim Crow thing in the Mississippi and this i'm like oh we're going to law by law i have just as many laws as we did in 1899 like that's where that's where things are going like going if we don't take every single step seriously that they're taking to just annihilate rights Miles i think you're so right because what was in my mind and what has been in my mind is just the narrative around this country and how it's a country of democracy and freedom and liberation manifest destiny when when you look at like the UN sustainable development report on rankings for women's rights and women's equality the United States is 38. Belarus is doing better than us i'm pretty sure Belarus is authoritarian um we're also only three rungs up above guess who Russia so i think we need to start thinking about how this place isn't as free as the narrative tells us it is and and globally we are doing terribly across so many vectors when it comes to human rights equality um basic basic human needs for people so i think miles back to like it it where it's it's not being hysterical it's actually just like we need to start beating the drum on we are doing terrible here and protecting a lot of people and just because we got movies and and music and all these things coming out of this country it's a distraction from actually really what's happening to us here dara i think i think that the thing is we are a country of freedom and democracy and manifest destiny and agency and all that stuff for white men but not for anybody else not for not for anybody else so i mean i say that because like it takes two to make a baby right so there's some men running around here that are impregnated all of these women who need abortions or whatever the case may be and there is literally no consequence for them no anything no whatever and for it i'm like are you a accessory to a crime if it's where we're going with it not a thing not a thing and you know all of these i think i think that you know a lot of this is is white misogyny's last stand it is you know attempts to punish but first i mean punish black people we always the first whatever minorities generally women like it's it is the rage is palpable and the fact that these people are not even pretending anymore and they're just in i mean abortion abortion bans are largely unpopular by voters right and you see places like Kansas beating them back and whatnot because this is not what everybody wants but these white men republicans are out here luncheon and you know as Miles said like we're watching these small things happen it seems so ludicrous that we're like we're not even going to pay attention to this but those small things end up being the precursors the foundation of the big things to come later so yeah hmm stay alert okay decorate your home stay alert don't be transphobic and put on some bobby call well to ease your and take your money out of swiss banks look that is my part for today podcast recap boom this week we welcome daniel hatcher on the pod to talk about his new book and justice ink how america's justice system commodifies children and the poor he formally worked at legal aid in his current professor of law at the university in baudemore civil advocacy clinic and the book he talks about how juvenile family and criminal justice systems thrive on monetizing inequity and harm struggling youth and families you have to have to listen to this episode make sure you buy the book it really is that good let's go professor hatcher it is an honor to have you today on pod to the people this is one of the books that i uh that i read and i was like wow i didn't i needed to read this i remember stumbling across you on turta being like can we make this happen i know you probably thought we were never gonna do it because we were slow to get you on but we got you here and it's honor to have you. D-ray thank you so much it's an honor to be on your show and have this conversation so let's start i started a million questions about what's in the book before we get there how did you get to this topic did you always care about the criminal justice system if something happened to you that like caused you to care did you always know you want to be a professor did you stumble into that like what's how'd you get here uh let's a good question a bit of a long answer but i'll try to shorten it i've been an advocate for low-income children and impoverished adults for over 25 years i went to law school with in mind that i wanted to do public interest law i wasn't really sure what that meant at the time and and although i believed and and equal and impartial justice at the time and and the and the and the need to fight for social justice wasn't really sure what it meant right so my eyes have been opened quite a bit as i've learned through my clients and and through my students over the years so my my first job after after law school and working in the public interest was representing children pulled into the highly dysfunctional Baltimore foster care system and i was overwhelmed by it you know like you know the the number of youth i was trying to represent and and their individual stories um and then you know realizing that it's not just their individual struggles and their parents struggles the very systems that are intended to serve them with welfare and justice are instead monetizing them okay now that is it's almost like i set you up because that's what i have a million questions about so there were some parts of this that i was like okay i already knew that good to see it in the written word but do it and then there were parts about foster care family court child support that i heard people talk about with sort of extracting problem from people but i like there wasn't a there there that i could touch could you first tell us what the premise of the book is and then let's go into wherever you want to start in terms of family court foster care child support of those three that's where i like to start in terms of issues but the premise of the book what were you what what was the goal? Sure well and it built from my last book my my first book was titled the poverty industry and that book really exposes how our human service agencies are often partnering private companies to turn vulnerable populations children and adults into revenue tools this book you know i fear is even more concerning as i'm exposing that our very systems of justice right are turning low-income children and adults into revenue tools and not just um there's not just disproportionate harm that that's uncovered the harm is being monetized and our justice institutions from our our juvenile courts to our family courts to our prosecutors offices to our probation departments policing agencies all of them are increasingly looking for ways to shift from their intended mission of maximizing equal and impartial justice to instead almost running like a factory right using those that they're supposed to serve right and instead maximizing efficiency and revenue you can almost visualize a factory assembly line right but it's almost instead of a an assembly line more like a disassembly line and you have already struggling individuals who are then deconstructed for every possible penny and the most striking i think example that that i found and it is also symbolic are out of ohion in multiple states where the book uncovers how juvenile courts are actually entering contracts to generate revenue from child removals um children who might be pulled into the system through the juvenile delinquency side right and the courts literally contract to generate revenue from those removals i can talk about that in a little more detail but but that's the that's the unfortunate um theme of the book okay let's uh the book broke down so many things so let's start at the let's start at the basics uh what is family court for people who like don't know how would you explain what family court is sure well in different jurisdictions it's a variety of things but it's typically and the foundational courts that i call them are what are often referred as lower level courts the family courts for low-income individuals often involve juvenile issues including child welfare the foster care proceedings and then child support right is the biggest part you know when we get into a discussion of child court child support proceedings most individuals don't realize that in this country they're really two systems of child support you have um the courts for the for the better off individuals where you might have parents who were married and they're pursuing a divorce and there might be dividing property multiple houses you know figuring out dividing the child support who's going to pay for college and the like um these aren't the courts for the poor when you're dealing with the child support 4d courts right which brings in title 4d child support agencies those courts are solely focused on establishing paternity right and more of a forced system in which parents are often literally required to participate if you have a low-income custodial parent who temporarily needs um public assistance white she or he is required to um not just name the absent parent and through that process of of establishing a paternity of its like custodial mother right but then to sue that individual over and over again for something called child support but that is a node to the children is to pay back the cost of welfare referred to welfare cost recovery and this practice dates way so now so now so now so now so now let's give give an example when i read this in the book i was like you are lying okay we can like give us an example sure um so in that example um like i talked about a foster child by the name of shawn um and the book and shawn is simultaneously real and hypothetical he's a dollar sign for the eskah's he becomes a commodity um the jewell court could first contract to generate revenue literally from removing shawn from his home through a foster care contract and i could talk about that a little more but then that same court in the family court as you described um may have an additional contract to generate more revenue through pursuing child support against the low-income mother shawn's low-income mother from whom the court just ordered the removal of shawn so the court could order essentially the foster care proceedings for shawn to remove from from his home generate revenue through that process and then pursue the absent parent for more right and pursue federal title 4d funds and meanwhile the mother is just struggling i have a question so this would be sue essentially asking the mom to incur a fee for the fact that her child was removed from the home that's right that that it's forcing the um parent who's already struggling you know desperately trying to reunify with with his or her son right or daughter um now to pay back the cost of foster care right you know while the child is being monetized right now the parent and the parent's harm is being monetized and making it even harder for that reunification process to take place um and and that's just scratching the surface right and then prosecutors come into play and they're and their contractual revenue schemes and probation departments policing agencies and the like blew my mind is when did you realize that parents are being charged for their kids being taken like do you remember the day you were like what right well that dates back to my early years as a legal aid lawyer both representing children and adults um in the system you know when i was representing children pulled into the system it's it's um it's again overwhelming to to um experience through them you know all all their struggles but then to realize that the systems right are then that are supposed to serve them are often using them um and the the first example that i that i came across in my research and advocacy um it's been since about 2004 uh now that that i've been researching and writing about that where foster care agencies will literally pursue children in their care who are either disabled or have dead parents right and then pursue their survivor benefits or disability benefits and take those resources from the very children in their care you know so you have the the state foster care agencies that literally the only reason they exist is supposed to be to serve and protect right children right are going after those children's assets and taking them from children you know and that you know led to additional research and looking at the child support program and how much of child support is not even owed to children you know like huge percentages in california is up to 40 percent right of the total child support debt is actually owed to the government to repay where they're pursuing the poor parents to repay the cost of welfare and foster care harming everyone in the process let's uh let's put up let's put a line in before we transition the child support so that we can like make sure people get and buy people I mean me make sure that we get the foster care part okay so recouping it it's and the idea that the state is is working to take the assets foster kids wild now what would you say to people though who would say that it it costs money to administer these welfare programs right that like it's not free and that somebody has to pay up what would you say to people who are like I get it it might not be great but like you know you should have to pay something what do you say to those people does that make sense sure I you know at first the the children are choosing to be pulled into foster care right nor are their parents choosing for their children to be taken into the child welfare system so we start from that right and then these agencies they're supposed to be funded from federal funds and state funds right they exist for the sole reason of serving the best interest of vulnerable youth they don't exist to extract resources from those vulnerable youth so under federal law and state law they're required when when children are removed from their homes to provide and pay for right those those services not the kids right so I've argued on that particular issue it's both immoral and illegal right and I think there are strong claims and it's just nonsensical right when you have an agency that exists to serve a population as an is actually taking resources from that population right it's counterintuitive so but then you could have an agency like the foster series not just pursuing and taking resources from Sean or another child as I described and the book right then they may also use Sean through this contract you know like so in the way that works I think is even potentially more concerning because the court the juvenile courts in these examples literally contract to become the foster care agency right and you know and so then what they do is like the first they put on their court hat adjudicated child the link went that allows them to put on their contractual foster care agency hat remove a child from the home right or label a child as foster care candidate at constant risk of removal and processing the court shifts and puts back its court hat back on again and rules on its own actions right and then if it rules on itself favorably it can draw down millions of title four e revenue funds from the federal government that are supposed to go to foster care agencies that the courts have tapped into they're they're monetizing vulnerable youth we're gonna come back to foster care let's go to um i'm telling you this is why i was like we gotta get him on the back of the ass but he got alert i got alert okay what let's talk about child support so many people would say you know if you have a kid there's a financial responsibility some people mostly men don't want to live up to that responsibility and that without the child support system kids and mothers would go without resources to provide for kids that would be uh you know i could call my aunt she would probably say that and i've heard people say well foster care is that so it's a I mean not foster child support is exploiting people and the not and the way that i've heard people talk through that is sort of explaining why men don't want to pay right or that the the amount that they were given as a percentage of their income is too high this is certainly the story that you see when you see celebrities go through the child support thing it's like why does so-and-so need like uh but your take on it is something different so i wanted you to help us understand why you think about child support not as a program that is actually supporting kids and moms but is exploiting people sure and uh you know it's a good description i think most people when they consider child support they're they're responding what they hear in the news and stories of celebrities and the like right where you have individuals who are better off uh and the stories of of non-payment and when an obligation has been awarded when you talk about low-income families this is often a forced system so it actually comes that the the 4d child support system which which is this agency-driven child support system in america comes from old english pore laws and what we're called bastardiacs early on where where parents who had children that were referred out of wedlock were literally criminalized um for having having children born out of wedlock and forced to post bonds um custodial mothers were literally jailed right if they didn't have that money right in order to indemnify the town from the potential risk of low-income children right that early um structure grew into what our current child support is system is the 4d system and america still um much of the 4d system it started with this purpose of recovering costs of forcing poor individuals to pay back the cost of any public assistance they received or foster care right when that happens then that's still a big part of the program but but even now when when you have this agency-driven system um and that pulls in mostly low-income families across the country most of the families pulled into the 4d system are poor um even when the money is owed to the custodial parent of the order set as a level at a level that's that's not manageable right and then the enforcement tools are punitive rather than helpful for the children harm results right so you can if you just look at the garnishment amount what happens after a child support order you know if you're low-income obligor um who who may be trying um his or her best to pay this child support obligation right and if he or she is able to find above ground employment right it's lucky enough you know after the struggle to find work um the garnishment amount you know immediately is going to be 65 percent right of the wages so the vast majority of people want said it's you can't afford you can't afford to pay rent you can't afford to buy food right so it's at such a level that it harms rather than helps um licenses are suspended so then the absent parent can't drive to work can't drive to help with the children drive the children to daycare drive the children to school right their credit is destroyed in the process many end up being sent to prison you know like because of criminal non-support proceedings within as to their criminal record would make it even harder to find jobs so it becomes um you know a cyclical process of harm you know that's already happening so you have this this harmful structure for many low-income parents and then we realize the courts are literally contractually monetizing that harm right you know i've seen contracts where courts and the child support um proceedings will will contract with the executive branch state agency the child support agencies and the the language of the contracts the child support agencies are literally buying court orders right you know and they're paying the salaries of the judicial magistrates they appear before that's in some of the jurisdictions and pennsylvania the family courts as we're discussing before contract to become the child support agency while they're operating as the courts right so again do you have this nonsensical violation of separation of of powers that that's happening and it's all about generating revenue rather than serving the children's best interests so what do you say though i can see people hearing that and being like well the guys you participated in the act of having a kid right they didn't like randomly have a kid and why should they be off the hook that like 65 percent like kids are you know raising a kid is expensive in america and without some sort of forced accountability kids and moms will go without the resources to you know provide for the kid especially in the earliest years what do you say to that sure well you know and then the book i'm not arguing against having a child support obligation right you know simply that when you have any type of process where the court is involved in the agencies involved you know two institutions the human service agencies intended to maximize welfare the courts intended to maximize justice that needs to be the mission right in this case the best interests of children wrapped up into that so you need a careful deliberation of the facts and obligation to make sure the proceedings only serve that goal of maximizing the children's best interests welfare and then and then justice instead what you see is this combination of punitive actions that make it difficult if not sometimes impossible you know for the to be able to pay the support obligation harming the obligor harming the custodial parent and harming the child and the like and meanwhile from that harm the justice institution is actually making money through contracts and incentivize right i've seen contracts related that the more orders they they order the more cases they process the more enforcement mechanisms they use the court is going to pull in more revenue and then same with the prosecutor sometimes probation officers in the life it's not supposed to be about money from from the justice institutions right it's supposed to be about serving that best interests of the child do you is there a good advocacy around this sort of highlighting this and changing the laws or or is it something that people are only now starting to acknowledge is an issue um well i i think there's growing attention not nearly enough you know and i think any need a change starts with awareness right you know so your show couldn't be more important you know in terms of the issues that you take on and discuss both both yourself and with people that you have on the show i mean that starts all of us to understand the problem and if we're going to move forward towards solutions we have to understand the problem first if we're going to try to work towards a fix it's got to be the right fix you're right you know so that's crucial um and you're seeing on some issues you know like with um that issues with child support some hopeful improvement um i've worked with advocates on that issue and also on the issue of foster children survivor benefits and their disability benefits and over years including um hearing from the voice of former foster youth right we're starting to see some states move in the right right direction to protect foster youth resources instead of taking them but it hasn't gone nearly far enough um in that way so so so the more we can expand awareness the better okay let's talk about probation so one of the things that you also argue is that probation is essentially exploiting people so for listeners remember probation is often a consequence in lieu of incarceration parole is uh the the slicing off of some of a sentence to serve a community that looks very much like probation um now press a hatchet one of the things that people will say is that you know people should be thankful for work programs and community service things like that because if not for you know this anklet thing or this home detention or community service you'd be in jail like some you did something wrong you got a consequence and probation even if it's not you know a pleasant experience for you is much better than jail i could hear people saying that and you are arguing that it is exploiting people how would how do you frame this in the context of what most people sort of believe today sure and it's you know it's an excellent description and and question um so many people's do view probation as part of the solution to mass incarceration right and the years the history of of harm the highly disproportionate harm based upon race that's been happening with mass incarceration but what we what we see then you know through through the research of my book and the research of others as unfortunately probation has grown into a business of itself it's a huge part of the factory that's monetizing rather than serving um if you just look at you know i discuss in the book one county in los angeles county where it itself sort of brags about how big it is you know as as a company the los angeles probation department um has more than 6,600 employees providing services to 57,000 adult probationers or more than 12,000 juveniles with an annual budget of 852 million right so that's a big you know branch of the factory you know that that's operating and what you see with probation unfortunately are multiple ways in which they're again using um the low-income individuals children and adults to generate revenue rather than serving now with both welfare and equal and impartial justice one of the ways is again is is through drawing down these foster care funds um and california and texas in multiple states across the country probation departments are contractually pursuing the foster care revenue right even though it's called foster care they're pursuing this revenue from children who are pulled into the system through the juvenile delinquency side right through juvenile justice um but then if probation takes control in places i'm in a certain type of facility or labels them as a foster care candidate at constant risk of removal and then all the monitoring that comes along with that you know you could be talking about ankle monitors right constant drug testing required therapy classes right unannounced visits it goes on and on probation officers wield a lot of power right and it's not surprising unfortunately we see individualized stories around the country of abuse of that power but here we're not just talking about individual abuse we're talking about the whole probation system monetizing the youth and again in just one county in california and orange county and just one year through these contracts the the probation department pulled in five point seven seven million um and foster care revenue i saw training slide um from these offices in california for the probation officers right on how to fill out reports essentially make sure they're maximizing this foster care revenue one of them even said like there was a listed as a bad example where they listed all is okay right you know and all is okay is not okay from their view because it means the money stops right their advisor trained how you got to provide bad information on those reports in order to keep pulling down the revenue then probation is not just through the foster care funds that they pursue i've also found contractual examples they're pulling in this child support revenue same way and then endless fines and fees right there in some jurisdictions in our countries entire probation offices all they do is pursue fines and fees so in that example you could have a court that orders an initial small fine for maybe five hundred dollars from a misdemeanor from something as small as a traffic ticket right but that quickly balloons into thousands of dollars after interest and more fees are tapped onto that right a collection costs are tapped onto that um and then the probation departments when they're involved in this while they're pursuing this debt for someone who can't afford to pay right they're adding additional fees they're ordering additional um conditions and services go to training classes that the people have to pay for right you know building that debt even more and then those probation departments in many states will actually require as a condition of probation the full payment of that debt that is unaffordable to the individual right so it literally creates a situation where the people can't get out of probation if they have to pay off a growing unaffordable debt that the probation department keeps adding to and the probation department is making money from right the people can't escape it becomes an inescapable cycle of monetized poverty people need to buy this book they need to read it there's more about share ups and in the rest of the system we don't have time to talk about it all but i hope this is a great teaser for people let me ask you two questions that we ask everybody the first is what do you say to people who's hope is challenged in moments like this people who you know feel like they read your book read my listen to the podcast they email they testified they were in this tree and they're like the world hasn't changed in the way i want to do what do you say to those people right well and you write about hope right you know and i i i believe in hope and i i still you know even all the the struggles i've encountered through my clients individually and you know what i expose in the book and sort of the systemic failings of our systems i still believe in the ideals of pursuing equal and impartial justice right and i feel like we have to have hope and pursue those ideals because if we don't you know if we're not pursuing that i that ideal those ideals they tend to be replaced by their opposites right you know so so the fight continues and our fight is connected to those who fought before us and those who are fighting after us right so so we're connected and you know i've seen some hope for improvement again even through the voices of former foster youth themselves you're standing up and having a voice involved in the legislative process and working for change i've worked with other advocates and and on this issue of agencies taking resources from children in their care now over ten states are moving in the right direction i worked on a bill in maryland that it's a partial success i think we might need to revisit it and improve on that bill but that was working with um jamey raskin when he was a state senator and now a member of congress um change is possible but we have to keep striving to increase awareness and strive for that ideal i also think those of us in the justice system like we need that mirror of uh that honest mirror of self-reflection right to be both be riding our own wrongs but then i think even if if you judge um a lawyer who's an officer of the court a prosecutor probation officer policing officer if they're trying their individually best to be true to their ethics right and their mission of equal justice right if they're working within a system that's structurally compromised both ethically and constitutionally then their ethics are are constitutionally compromised and ethically compromised you can't just be working to approve yourself right you have to be working to prove the systems in which we're operating boom and the last thing is um what's a piece of advice that you've been given that's always stuck with you um well be true right you know like you know we we have to and that means a lot it means to be true to ourselves and and you know what drives us you know because i i write a lot about this tension you know with with agencies and and
