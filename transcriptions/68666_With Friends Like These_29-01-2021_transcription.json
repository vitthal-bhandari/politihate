I want to talk about everything you've written lately, but you've written a lot. So let's talk about Joe Biden, the man of the hour. One of the most powerful points I think you've made in your long essay about Joe Biden is that everything we've done over the past 40 years or so, everything women have done for women's rights has ended not with a female president, but with the most average of white guys. Please explain. I want to amend your recapitulation of that to say that I do not think that everything that has been done with regard to fighting for more diverse representation ends with the election of Joe Biden. I really don't think that this is an end. The piece that I wrote. I do think that that was how it was presented in a DNC video in the middle of the convention this summer where my jaw was hanging open. OK, like that's that's part of that that version of the story where the culmination of like the really long and tortured path to expand the space that women and especially democratic progressive women take up in American politics. Like there was a version of that story told during the Biden campaign and I looked particularly at this video on like Ladies Night at the convention, which you may remember. And I went like I watched that video and I was like, whoa, because like everything at the convention, it ended with like a tribute to Joe Biden. And that and and for reasons that are like go back 30 years did not actually the story of women moving into democratic politics in greater numbers. The video that they showed telling that story didn't include any to Hill, which is like for a lot of reasons having to do with Joe Biden. But that's like telling history wrong. I was fuming about that that night. And it was like, just don't tell the story if you can't tell it true. Right? Like you don't have to do that. Obviously the march for equality and all sorts of various did not begin 40 years ago or even 60 years ago, it began much before that. And the fight for more inclusivity in politics does not end with Joe Biden. But there is this version of the story that you kind of pull out of that DNC video that I think is a is a version of this story where women make possible the Joe Biden presidency in a as you're pointing out, like in this incredibly ironic way, part of the promise that made him attractive. I'm reckoning not with Joe Biden, but with America and with the limits of my own expectations for how much better I wish it were than what it is. And what we can actually do to protect ourselves within it, right? Like one of the things about this piece that I just wrote about Joe Biden and America's relationship with a with white capitalist patriarchy is about saying I'm wrong. I was wrong. And that's something I'm like, that's part of what this piece is struggling with. So part of what Joe Biden sold that wound up being attractive enough for him to win was a return to American norms, right? It is a view that treats the Trump presidency as an aberration. I tend to see the Trump presidency as if not the culmination, because I think there will be other combinations, something that an American right as symptom and that the right wing has been building toward for decades. I don't see Trump as distinct from a contemporary Republican party and the way that a lot of people do. But of course, we know that he was specifically monstrous and openly malevolent and incompetent in ways that I think, you know, do make him distinct and that removing him was a national emergency. And we did need the candidate who could remove him. And that candidate was Joe Biden. He removed him. And what I'm exploring here is what about Biden made him the guy, the person who could win. And I do think he was the person who could win. Yes, so for women of a certain age, Biden's handling of the Anita Hill hearing is the thing we think of maybe first when it comes to Joe Biden is definitely like the first thing I think of when I think of criticisms of him. But you point out in this piece that there is this it's not history rhyming. It's history in exact atonal discord. About how that has sort of in a step by step way led to his presidency. Could you impact that for us? Anita Hill testifies in 1991, October of 1991. And she is treated abysmally by the Senate Judiciary Committee, worse by the Republicans on that committee, but not well by the Democrats. And what it what in the country watches this and what the country sees is a Senate Judiciary made up entirely of white men. Democrats and Republicans, it was all white men who in this particular context, because Clarence Thomas is an African American man, nominated by George H.W. Bush to replace Thurgood Marshall on the court. Anita Hill is a black woman who has worked alongside him and is testifying that she was sexually harassed. So here are, you know, issues of race and gender at the fore and the race and gender of the Judiciary Committee, the people who are hearing them become like just put on display for the country. And in the year that follows, it's not easy. It's not as simple as everybody was mad about how Anita Hill was treated. And therefore there was what was called for a long time, the Year of the Woman, which was 1992. There were other things there had been a I think a Senate banking scandal that had left a lot of people retiring, a lot of open seats. There were other factors in play that permitted a wave of candidates to run and win. And a historic number of them were women. And that was especially true in the Senate where four women won seats and that was an unheard of record in 1991. They included Carol Mosligrand, who was the first black woman to ever win a Senate seat. And I mean, that's like you sort of have to say that over and over again. And then remind yourself that the second woman to ever win a Senate, black woman ever to win a Senate seat was Kamala Harris. And part of what I look at in this piece is the way that that change then begets further change, right? And it's not like this is, you know, and these weren't the first women in the Senate. But again, this history of women in politics extends back hundreds of years. But this was a massive change. Joe Biden suffered reputational damage. He had been the Senator from Delaware since 1970, who's elected in 1972, came in January 1973. He'd had this like long career at that point, not as long as that now. And he like he was amply criticized for his mishandling of those hearings. And there's enough of a national conversation about the, you know, the monochrome maleness of that judiciary committee that he has, Feinstein and Carol Mosley Brown to serve on the judiciary committee. Mosley Brown initially didn't want to serve on the committee. She says, yes, they do that. Those two women do that to help Joe Biden fix his own reputation, right? After he mishandled that. There's links in this chain, right? The link that starts with Anita Hill, that then goes to Carol Mosley, Braun and Barbara Boxer, that then goes to Carol Mosley, Braun allowing Joe Biden to have his reputation shined up just a bit. If she hadn't accepted that, that judiciary committee assignment, perhaps Joe Biden would not have been able to recover his reputation. So she accepts that assignment, then Barack Obama wins, right? Or actually, well, then Barbara Boxer retires and Kamala Harris comes in. Yes. Oh, no, they're all tied together. They're all tied together. And part of it is the person who at this moment has wound up getting boosted by all this in this moment is Joe Biden. And like he has, I mean, he was boosted by being vice president to Barack Obama for good reason. And I want to say something. I write this in the piece and I really, you know, this piece is about power and race and gender. And it is really meaningful that Joe Biden is such a good vice president to Barack Obama, right? It's a historically unprecedented situation. And in my view, it is probably because he was such an average, like non-spectacular American white guy, a politician that he's the perfect foil for a black president. And and hi, like, let's acknowledge how discomforting it was. Like the left criticism of Barack Obama's administration to the side. Let us talk about how discomputing it was for this country to have had a black president in like so much so that we have just had four years of like open, violent racism. I mean, not that that doesn't exist on a daily basis all the time, but like within the context of presidential politics. I mean, the sort of spasm of of vengeful, violent white supremacist right-wing politics in this country is like, that's how that's how like allergic so much of this country was to one African American man being president for two terms. And Joe Biden was a white man who served loily and capably as his number two. And that is that is a meaningful job he did. And it and it is meaningful, I think, for a lot of people, including me. And, you know, so that I it's not that he just won a golden ticket in being Barack Obama's vice president. But just because I know that so Joe Biden didn't feel didn't feel like he had to prove himself, you know, like he could just be like, yep, I deserve to be vice president to this guy. Like in title, it gets your places. And I don't again, I'm not I'm not actually trying to be mean. I'm trying to look critically and analytically at how power works in this country when it applies to the presidency. We're going to take a quick break to play a part in the system we must perform in. Welcome again to all those visiting the land of sobriety for the month of January. I hope you enjoy your stay with us here. Long term sober folks. I have been around for quite a bit and I'd like to offer you a pro tip or two. Here's a big one. Don't just swap in soda for your drinks. It gets boring. It doesn't feel special. It feels like you're at the kids table. It doesn't feel like you're making a grown up choice not to drink. You still need a grown up drink. Enter Ken Eforix. Ken Eforix drinks have sophisticated flavors and they're made to address the stuff that grown ups care about. Think adaptogenic herbs and mushrooms that help curb stress in the moment and over time as well as new tropics that support cognitive function, like clarity, memory and creativity. There's three different recipes. High road has an herbaceous flavor. You get the sense of feeling a lifted mind and a relaxed body. Think of it for happy hour or brunch or wherever you're looking for something kind of bright and snappy. Ken Spritz comes in a can and it's sparkling, an app. Roll brain boost. I think of it as kind of outdoorsy social maybe because the can makes it so portable, take it on a picnic and then there's dream light. That is the one I have literally most nights. It's a genuine nightcap because it tastes like warm and cozy with smoky, kind of spicy flavors and because it has ingredients that promote sleep. Melatonin, tryptophan and racy mushrooms.

And we are back for more with Rebecca Traster. And in some ways we can look at the rise of self identified white supremacists as a white supremacy as an identity choice, which is what has happened, I think, under Trump in a way, like sort of in contrast to Joe Biden. And it's obviously many contrasts, but like so many people write about this and I think it's true, that kind of violent resistance to change and equality comes when you no longer believe that you can just walk into a room and be in charge. Like it comes from the threat of losing something. But what Trump did was weaponize resentment and fear into a very specific movement. So it's not that Trump invented this. He did put it in the Oval Office in an open way. I want to go back to what you're saying and point out that especially a lot of people who cover politics, course race politics, beltway, whatever you want to say, the people who tell the story of American politics, presidential politics, Senate politics, legislative policy stuff. They're allergic to bringing in these very issues that I irritatingly continue to think about. But that's part of how when you don't have the analysis to point out how racist resentments are being leveraged to get us to welfare reform under a Democratic president. When you do not have people pointing out, and in fact, a media telling you over and over again, that the rise of the Tea Party was about economic conservatism when all they wanted to do was vote repeatedly to defund Planned Parenthood, right? There's a denialism about how race and gender shape our policy and our partisan politics. And that gets us to policy decisions and partisan strategy that have landed us here. One of the ways you get Trump is people being like, yeah, racism is bad. One of the things that we have not talked about is the tremendous black support he had. And the degree to which it is our responsibility to, while sitting around complaining about him, to take that into account in the story of Joe Biden, right? I told the story, what like one narrative thread around representation in elections. And there is another important part of the story, which is that black voters voted for Joe Biden in the primary and made him the nominee. And I don't want to pretend that that's not real and meaningful. And I think, and this is where it comes down to my critical analysis, is trumped by the wisdom of those voters who saw what I couldn't invite him. Last round of ads coming right up. With friends like these, we'd like to welcome Warby Parker as a new sponsor.

Warby Parker is committed to providing exceptional vision care online and in stores. Glasses start at $95, including prescription lenses. They have sunglasses, progressives, and blue light lenses for all us screen workers as well. So, and this is true, I am wearing Warby Parker glasses right now. And I've been wearing Warby Parker glasses for about 10 years. I have several pairs of sunglasses, a couple of far distance pairs for driving, and a pair of readers, one of which I'm wearing right now, that I'm constantly forgetting, hence the reason I have two of them. I have been wearing them for so long that there are a couple of styles that I have that they don't make anymore. And why do I love Warby Parker? I like the price, I like the styles that are available, I like getting glasses made for my weirdly narrow head. They have lots of different sized frames that you can shop by head size, basically.

Next time you're in line for something or waiting for something and you want to pull out your phone, don't doom scroll. Try something that's actually good for your brain. A word game. And specifically, may I suggest word collect. Word games are my absolute favorite kind of game. And word collect is sort of like scrabble, but without a board. You get tiles, you're timed at how fast you can put them into words. Of course, it starts easy, but it gets hard. If you're a scrabble player, it's great practice for whenever it is we all get to finally sit down across each other and play board games. Word collect is addicting, but it's not going to depress you. You're going to get your brain cells exercised rather than depressed. There's over 2,000 levels, so you won't run out of challenges. And right now, Word collect is offering you 2,500 coins and 500 gems to start when you download and play. You can use those to level up or extend a streak or just to play longer. Stop mindlessly scrolling through social media and keep your mind sharp. Just go to Apple or the Google store and search for word collect. It is free to download. Now the rest of the show. Damon Young at Very Smart Brothers. He wrote a piece about Joe Biden and Black voters that stayed with me. He's actually now been almost a year. It's not that we don't appreciate the progressive policies of people like Joaquin Castro and Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. We're smart people and we see that if you do a different kind of economic policy, that would benefit us. But we're voting for Joe Biden. This was his analysis. I don't want to claim to speak for everyone, but he writes, because we know white people. We know who you're going to vote for. And it is protective of us to support the person that you're going to vote for. I think that absolutely is one straight of it. I also want to say that there are tons of voters, black voters who really like Joe Biden, like love Joe Biden and feel that they have a long relationship with him, that they can trust him. Many who genuinely love his relationship with Barack Obama and perhaps especially that willingness to work in concert with and loyally to Barack Obama. And then there is that sort of like, there's also the sort of 12-dimensional chess, I think very extremely brilliant voting strategy of like what and that's sort of what I'm coming to too from a feminist analysis, but that there was like, it does take us back to this like what, who are the most vulnerable populations in this country made most vulnerable by the Trump administration and in fact by a Republican grip on a hard right party's grip on power. In many cases are black voters and so the best and most like the best bet is the person who can win. And I as a feminist writer strained against that thinking during the primary and said no we can't just go by our old models of who can win and we got it like we have and this the piece that I wrote about this again is really not meant to just be another excuse to be to be grim about Joe Biden though it includes those elements. It's also really questioning like I don't know I was wrong. He's hired some great people. He hired some people and that's okay to me but like he has put to my eye so far like terrific people in brilliant forward thinking people who also happen to be extremely diverse okay in terms of race, gender identity, all you know he's he's but even more than that just like super smart and forward thinking people in positions of power and that's great like that tells me he's building an administration that has tremendous potential. Biden is a listener. I think that's one of his character traits you know like it gets talked about like he's the mourner in chief like he goes and he empathizes and stuff. I think he listens and I think this cabinet we're talking about these appointments we're talking about are a function of him listening. I think Kamala Harris is a function of him listening. The democratic party the leadership of the democratic party I think are not such good listeners. Right well and it's a system who's decided who its leadership is going to be. I mean and it's a system that in small increments like I you know I think the party has tremendous talent in it and that talent that pool of tremendous talent is growing but this is a party that was forged in these years when exactly my high school original attitudes pre welfare reform about Bill Clinton were like we'll take what we can get right like coming out of Reagan years when the idea of what it meant to be a democrat was like working with Wall Street like that I mean that's how Chuck Schu- those years that Chuck Schummer came to power right and that's what but that's what a lot of the democratic party still is it's a lot of people coming out of a crouch and I don't mean actually coming out of that crouch. I mean a lot of people coming out of an era in which the crouch was the politics and they're still in power and they have sort of leadership power within their caucuses and like and that's bad that's bad because we cannot this is not a crouch moment just purely tactically by the way the Republican party if if you were a shark if imagine you were a savvy democrat okay like what you might notice is that the Republican party like is falling I mean is terrifying and and terrifying in its furious power but also splitting at the seams and that if you were savvy is the moment and and like and we're in crisis and people are starving and evicted and and you are and if you're a democrat you are theoretically supposed to represent the interests of the vulnerable and your opposition which in fact has until like recently been extremely mighty and and kept you from exercising some of the representative power you might they're falling apart it is the moral and strategic imperative of democrats right now to act aggressively on behalf of people who need them to act I think you say a version of this in your piece which is um you know democrats for many years were accused of being a party that just gave away money let's own that let's be like yeah you know what we are the party that gives away money we're gonna give away money right now because people need it it works it works like that's you know social security like this it works people love it give them money give them stuff the the like the I mean and that's when we were talking before about the degree to which like there is this there's been a failure to really interrogate what kind of politics and what kind of attitudes and what kind of biases have undergirded the erosion of of a mid 20th century um democratic sort of commitment to giving the governed the things that they might require for stability and and dignity right and of course we know that the new deal itself was was built around around whiteness you know and excluded populations uh you know it in ways that must be corrected but then coming out of the new deal and moving through the civil rights women's gay rights movements of the late 20th century what you got was an ascendant republican party um that used race and gender uh I mean if you look at the narratives around welfare moms to totally tear apart over a period of decades the kind of um social safety net and economic policy um that democrats were supposed to stand for and democrats disempowered just sat and sort of a took it and be agreed with it like came to those terms and and and that's the thing that that's got to be done and this and the democrats are in power and they have the ability to provide that for people they actually they can they can find ways to do it you can do it and they should do it because it is the correct thing to do and at this moment it also happens to be strategically smart yeah I grew up I was actually thinking of another way to describe the crouch and it's a scarcity mindset it's the idea that oh my god we're gonna lose we're gonna lose anything at any minute gotta like gotta just fit into whatever scheme is happening or else we'll lose everything and you know that is a that's a traumatizing way to think about life and I it's hard to unlearn which is why we need just completely new leadership listen they can lose any time so do the right thing when you have a lost you know like when you have the opportunity to actually do the right thing like hey take a shot maybe it'll help you win next time the idea that like we have to be careful we have to find this kind of ground it is a kind of crazy both sidesism in which the in which the idea of what the sides are has been pre packaged by a hard right way it brings to mind something I think as recline pointed out in his book on polarization he doesn't get into this as much as I like but polarization happens often when one party becomes more diverse than the other because the diverse party has to deal with internal dissent for one right like they've got different voices which is good but you have different voices and the other party gets to take advantage of patriarchy and white supremacy when you're actually a party that is supposed to represent the majority which democrats do and that majority is a diverse majority of diverse experiences you know identities class like economic perspectives it's actually hard to find one unifying message right because it's inevitably going to leave and if you're trying to be responsible to the people that you're representing it's actually very hard to come up with some neat little political umbrella that like gets everybody under it like and so you get these messy attempts to like tell some bigger complicated new on story of america that you can't put on a t-shirt like fucking manga right but like actually if you're only representing a power and it's not just like if the power structure that you are fundamentally representing is a white supremacist capitalist corporate beholden patriarchy you're it's piffy man you got one you got one view of power in the world that you can put on a t-shirt and you're golden and so that's actually it is listen it's a messaging challenge but it shouldn't actually be a governing challenge is my view if you govern with generosity and some moral um like and a fundamentally moral strategy you know that's the thing just give people things they need to see that that feels piffy to me give people money like i think that fits on a t-shirt we have touched on some reasons for hope in this conversation i feel like we should return to that because it is necessary in our project yeah it's absolutely strategically necessary to feel hope if you get hopeless you're done the reason that i can hope for more now is because i actually think we can do more i think we have done more i think the party has gotten better right i think i am i am i am as we've discussed wildly critical of a lot of its leadership and and a lot of people who still have power within it but we are living through a rebuilding of the party it's just slow then they're not the people who are thrilling and exciting and who i think understand what we should do to make the country a better place for more of its inhabitants um those people are winning office they're winning elections they are defeating not just republicans but um you know some of the democrats who have been holding them back right we you see and it's and it's not just aosse it's marie newman you know it's it's how close jesus sisneros came in texas like we are seeing the party get better and that permits me to be more critical right if i were still living in a world where i thought the best we could do um was what we've got then you would probably hear me still being a cheerleader for the democratic party because i think it's you know in in a and i know i am a little bit of a cheerleader for the democratic party because no because we got i we got to survive and we got to win and and and the alternative is really terrible i'm not and i don't ever want to be in a position where i'm pretending that that's not the case and people like you know joe biden winning is a our salvation i am so critical of joe biden and i am so grateful with every fiber of my being that he's a president both those things can be true and i think it's actually incumbent on me to like work on thinking about both those things simultaneously but i wouldn't give in to the critical part if i thought this was just the best we could ever get right i think it's really important to do both at the same time thanks so much for back up for coming on again thank you for happy and that is it for the show this podcast is a production of kricken media it is produced by allison harrera with assistance from isi marglie's this episode was engineered by louis lino lea michman has been our social media genius
