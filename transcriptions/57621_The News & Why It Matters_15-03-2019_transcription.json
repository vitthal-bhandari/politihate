    "text": " Happy Friday. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am at Saragans all this once again joined by Pat Gray from Pat Gray Unleashed. Chad Prather from Never Been So Happy to Be Anywhere in My Life on a Friday. I'm going to sit right here with you guys. I was feeling that. You mean it too. I know. I know. It feels like it was yesterday, right? It's not crazy. Josh Hammer, editor at large from The Daily Wire. Thanks for being with us again. It's a pleasure to be here. Smartest dude I know. I know. You were like, he says big words. I don't know. Three syllables. That's your mask. That's your cut off. Yeah, I could say on a Monopoea. There you go. You guys are in for a show apparently. So we are going to get into all of the news stories that we didn't get to earlier on in the week. But before we do that, we want to thank our sponsor, Relief Factor. So apparently there was a study that came out that says that most Americans are just living in pain all the time. And they don't think that there's anything that they can do to get out of pain. Which I heard that and I was like, that's the most depressing thing ever. You just wake up. You're in pain. And you're like, it's just life now. And you go to bed and you're in pain over and over and over again. You might, can you relate to this at all? A little bit. A little bit. So I could. And I was in a car accident. I had a messed up back. And that's how I lived. And it really does affect your life in every way, shape, and form. You get grumpy all the time. You don't want to do anything. It just really affects your life. Might I suggest that you try Relief Factor if you are one of those people? Relief Factor is 100% drug free, which I love. I know you men are like, drug free. Okay, that doesn't work. But it works for 70% of the people who buy their three week quick start pack that they have right now for 1995. It works for 70% of them. They go on to keep ordering more. It works for me. It can work for you. If you are in pain, it's worth the 1995 to try it. See if you can get out of pain. Go to ReliefFactor.com or you can call 800-500-8384. All right, so in really, really big news, air pollution is racist. Yes. The air that Americans breathe is not equal. And we've got white privilege to deal with. We've got the white income inequality. And now there's white air pollution. Apparently, blacks and Hispanics disproportionately breathe air that's been polluted by whites, according to a new study. The first time the racial gap between who causes air pollution and who breathes it has been discovered. Finally. You know, they finally caught us going into minority neighborhoods and filling the air with all kinds of toxins and then going back to the suburbs where we don't have to breathe it. I didn't think they'd ever catch us, but they did. They did. And so I guess now the jig is up. So I don't really know. News like this is what makes my head hurt. I need ReliefFactor now. I'm not sure if ReliefFactor can help you with that. Now do China. Now do India. You know, if you breathe in China, it's the equivalent of smoking 21 cigarettes. I mean, that's how bad the air is in certain places. Wow. This is why you only see them wearing gas masks. Wow. Yeah, it's bad. What this reminds me of, I married in the 2016 primary. Ted Cruz had this flat tax plan. And apparently some economic study purported to show that Ted Cruz's flat tax would disproportionately benefit more men than women. So it was something like left to side. I think it was Vox, might have been like Huff Post or Mother Jones or whatever. But I think it was Vox. How to take the basically said Ted Cruz's flat tax plan is misogynistic. Okay. And it's the same thing here. Okay. It's based on who it impacts. In legal lease, the Supreme Court calls it disparate impact theory. It's all the rage on the left. Back in the Obama administration, Eric Holt is attorney general, was trying to do FHA, federal housing agency, housing policy based on disparate impact. So it's very important to understand how it impacts various people and then deem it racist based on that. It's insane. Okay. It's facially absurd. This is not how any logical, like rational thinking human being should conduct his policy analysis. But yeah, they did this at Ted Cruz's flat tax plan. Apparently now I guess the air is breathing his races too. Well, you're white. I'm white. It's my weapon list. But are you? But are you? Because you know what, you can identify as anything you want today. Oh, good. Let me show you the last logic. Here's the logic right here. Go to the cards, go to the arts. What's racist today? White marble statues. No, we've already done that one. What's racist today? Oh, the oak trim in the dormitories in the campus. No, we've already. Air. Have we done air yet? No, let's do air today. Air. You. You're on it. Go. Find out. Do the research. Why is air racist? Get back to me tomorrow. We're publishing it. What's sad is we're pretty much at that point. I mean, that's ridiculous. Right. Like that's not necessarily an exaggeration. Yeah. That is where we are right now. I want to know how much money. Do you know if it says, how much money they spent on this study? It didn't say. To prove that air is racist. I'm hoping it's millions because it's an important study. Groundbreaking. I mean, I, you know, again. I mean, I didn't know it last week. Now I know. How far do you know it? And what are we supposed to do to combat it? I wonder. White people should stop breathing and stop polluting. I guess we stop driving cars and stop participating in industry. I don't know. It's, they didn't really have solutions in this. They just place blame. It's amazing. There's always got to be a victim and there's somebody causing the problem and it's always white people causing the problem. Is the blame on the farting cows this time or is that just? No, no. That's all. I told you this. I'm dated. I'm dated. I'm sorry. Well, if they stop putting Planned Parenthood's within walking distance of urban centers and killing black babies, you know, it wouldn't be so disproportionate. But I just went there. I'm scared of it. It's true. It's true. Stop, stop killing yourselves. Stop killing yourselves. But that's what it boils down to. Everybody they want to talk about, oh, we're victimized. We're victimized. No, you're victimizing yourself. You're victimizing yourself. You're killing your communities. You're, you're killing the family unit. I mean, if we really wanted to go into that place and I'll get off the soapbox here. Oh, let's go to that place. You go to that place. Look back in the 60s, back in the 50s and the 60s, 70% of black homes had mothers and fathers in them. Today 70, 70, 70, 24%. Now have mothers and fathers. Stop killing yourself. Don't blame it on the air. Don't blame it on white people. Don't blame it on any of that stuff. And look, I can trot out as many people as you need to of all different walks of life, all different places of socioeconomic status, all skin colors and everything. And they're going to tell you the same thing. You can't just continue this victimhood mentality. If you're going to blame air, or you give me a break on this thing, air, air, white people's fault that you're breathing the wrong air. That, that is the height of when we start getting into privilege and looking for something first world to complain about. I think we were just taking a church for a second. Okay. Next up, the story that Chad, you talked about, I believe it was Wednesday. Yes, on this program of the college admissions scandal. So, see people don't think, I think people look at this as a novelty. This college admissions scam and scandal and the bribery that was going on where all of these rich people, it wasn't white privilege as so many people want to say. This was rich privilege. This is where Uber rich people basically hired somebody to the tune of $25 million collectively. William Singer, who is an admissions specialist, counselor, whatever that is. And he starts taking money and he's bribing coaches and standardized test monitors and people who are over the admissions process for these major universities. He's putting money in their hands so that these kids who are underqualified and incapable can get an admission to the school of their choice. They're doctoring pictures and things like that, making it look like the kid was on the soccer team or excelling at lacrosse when they never picked up a lacrosse stick over in their life. So, this thing gets exposed because it makes major news because of two Hollywood celebrities, Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman, they're doing it for their kids. Again, I said this on Wednesday, can you imagine being that kid and going, but did you really pay for me to get in school and be like, well, maybe you're stupid. We didn't have a choice. I feel like my parents didn't really love me. I had to go to the University of Georgia based on merit and my parents didn't do anything to help me. They didn't even move me into the dormitory. They didn't even go to the campus with me when I moved. I packed up the Grand Am and rolled. I don't understand this thing, but here is the blowback. Here's what's going on. Now there are two girls, and this is just the first. They're just starting to pull the string on this thing. Two girls who are Stanford graduates have decided to file a class action lawsuit against all of these universities because they say we did not get to go to the University of our choice, and now our Stanford diploma is not worth what it could be or should be because now a prospective employer may look at us and say, did you go to Stanford on your merit or did your parents buy your way in? And so they're saying we want not only punitive damages, but we want all of our tuition and fees back. So I got a new plan for Bernie Sanders. You want to give everybody a free college education? Just let everybody sue the school they went to and get a refund. That's what we're up against. It's just the beginning. Watch. This is going to be a major, major deal. Josh, you're an attorney. Yeah. Way in on this. Yeah, so I have like two basic takes to this story. The first is what I hope from policy perspective is that this opens up people's eyes to the huge scam that is a fellow government subsidizing the student loan industry. That is one thing that we really need to get under control here. All we're doing is subsidizing universities to raise tuition year and year out. Those tax dollars are being used to subsidize that are disproportionately hurting lower income people. And it's really a direct, progressive wealth transfer. It's a wealth transfer from lower income people to the higher income people that are attending these elite universities because try as they might, all the top universities are still going to be disproportionately drawing from the top echelon of the socioeconomic scale, right? But from a fashion can only go so far. I mean, the elite schools are still going to be comprised of largely rich people. That's just the kind of unfortunate reality of what it is. So from policy perspective, that's what we need to start doing is cracking down on the federal self-suffstization. However, it has a $38 billion in downman. They're doing damn fine. They don't need our freaking tax dollars. And then you kind of couple that along with the fact that they're just indoctrinating the youth into all this leftist marks and stuff. I mean, the conservatives better get their act together on this issue. That's the first thing. The second thing is, and this is not a novel take. I've seen this take a few times this week. I think it's the correct take nonetheless, is in a functioning university setting, people who do not belong to university on merit but are literally being bought in, they will be weeded out. They will be on the bottom of the bell curve. They will be funky and they will be funky out. The fact that this is not happening shows all the other problems are going on in universities these days, right? You've got serious gray inflation. There's no integrity to grading your curves anymore. And ultimately what happens is the diplomas that everyone has, and I've got mine hanging on my wall too. It's vanity. The degree is there for social symbol. They're not teaching anything. I went to Duke for college, University of Chicago for law school. Law school is a little different. Let's focus on the college. Even at these elite colleges, you're there to meet people, to have social experiences, to go drink and go sporting events. There are very, very, very few even top colleges these days that are actually focusing on teaching the great Western books on the Greeks, on philosophy. They don't even teach history anymore. No. No. I mean, like, it's like, it's like, one third of Americans can name like one of the three branches of government or something astounding like that. I mean, our crisis of civics is deeply depressing, but it all comes back to the notion that we've just made university kind of this symbolic gateway as opposed to an actual inherent educational value. Pat, you want to wait for this? My biggest take from this was USC has a rowing team. What the hell? What is that about? If one penny of my tax dollars has gone to the USC rowing team, I'm pissed. What is going on there? I thought that was a Harvard thing and a Yale thing. I didn't think that was on the West Coast too, but it is surprisingly. And she's not on the team, but the rowing coach has pole at the admissions office too. I mean, some weird things are going on in America and I'm glad they've come to light. Thank you for that really, really intense take on this particular story. That's the kind of thing that makes you think, though. It really is. It is. No, but I do want to talk about where's college even going, right? Because I have a son who is almost seven and I was just having this conversation with my husband last night. I mean, do we want him to even go to college? See, that's the thing. I had a caller this morning that said, you know, who the winners are in the story? Are the kids that aren't getting into the college as a result of the rich people taking their spot? So they're not being indoctrinated. I mean, that is something to consider because they are propaganda centers now. And you don't have to go to these propaganda centers to be somebody in this country anymore. You don't have to do it. I don't. Yeah, I'm at two oldest daughters are in two different universities and we heavily monitor what they're discussing, what they're talking about, what they're studying, what they're looking into because it is. It's a dangerous thing. It's an indoctrination center of the left. And I think to the degree that you can go to an institution of higher learning specifically for a reason, don't go if you're planning on graduating undecided, which is what so many do. And, you know, it's up to the parent. It is really up to the parent. You've got to get a grip on this thing and actually start raising and training our kids all the way through. And it's our jobs and our role as parents to help our kids develop a sense of destiny to know where they're going in life. That's emotionally, spiritually, mentally, professionally. I should know by the time my kids are teenagers what their giftings are, what their skill sets are, what their brains were, and I should help guide them through that. So I don't say throw the baby out with the bathwater. I think they're at this stage in the game. There is still some merit to higher education. I agree with what Josh said. It is a vanity thing. This is obviously what this was because these kids couldn't get in there and they weren't going to pass. They wanted the college experience and be able to say this is where we went. So I still, I agree with, you know, friends like Mike Rowe who look at the thing and say, look, there are trade skill jobs out there. You can go out there and do great. You can not graduate with all this debt. You can go out there and make a six-figure income and do very well as a trade skilled person. And there's a need for that in America. And I think it's just going to continue to turn itself on its head to where more people are going to be going to these trade skills or trade schools and just working on skills that they can do outside of college unless people are going to be, you know, worried about going to college and then having to pay off all of these loans. Yeah, for sure. I mean, in 2016, I think Marco Rubio got a little trouble. He has some quote where he said we need fewer philosophers and more like carpenters. That's totally true, by the way. I mean, like he got like Chris Ospada. It's totally true. But I want to make a slightly different point, actually. The indoctrination on the University of Kansas is famously terrible. It's been famously terrible. At least since Bill Buckley wrote God of Man in Yale in the early 1950s, probably even going back further than that. But we know that's terrible. What is even more insidious, though, is that they're starting indoctrination earlier. They really are. Much earlier. I have a good friend in Houston. He is a son in, is a junior in high school. Pretty upscale public school. He was telling me a crazy, crazy story. He's in the US history course. The professor who was an unabashed kind of like, bit over a classic, like a white, you know, New York Times reading progressive. He's teaching them World War II history. He discussed the Holocaust for five minutes, glossed over like it was nothing. Literally like straight out of like a Palestinian Authority textbook. And when someone in the class raised his hand to ask why this was the case, the teacher apparently said I'm told by my friend that it is just a drop in the war and that America's crimes in the war were much worse. Oh man. Oh my gosh. Junior in high school. Yeah. Like a, like a, like a, like a, like a well to do, decently prominent, I think, public school in Houston, Texas. Dad is terrifying. Terrifying. Oh my gosh. Back in a minute. Yeah. It's so crazy. You heard me like, Texas? Exactly. That's the other person who actually said California can really hate. Before we continue the conversation, I want to thank our sponsor, iTargetPro. Pat, I heard you on the radio, not too long ago. And you said, you were talking about iTarget, and you said, yes, Sarah calls them like laser bullets or whatever. But I would just like to point out for the record that on the actual package, it says laser bullet. Look at this. Look at that. It says laser bullet. I think that's photoshoot. So we were talking about it on this program and I said, Pat made fun of me. And Sue goes, well, it actually does say laser bullet right there. And I have to give him a hard time about that. So when I say it's a laser bullet, I really do. It really is a laser bullet. A laser bullet, which just saying it sounds super cool. So if you want to fire laser bullets like we do, in all seriousness, iTargetPro is the best way to practice using your firearm at home. As most of us know, dry firing is the ultimate way to get to know your gun, to get to know how it feels when you pull the trigger, to get to know how long the pull is. I have a 380 at home, and the pull is way longer than you expect it to be. But I don't get to go to the range all the time. Plus it's expensive. You have to pay for the ammunition and the range fees. iTargetPro is the way to train at home. So you put the laser bullet in your gun, and as you saw in that video, you can fire at the target. There's an app that comes, you can download on your phone that keeps track of it. And so it's not like a laser pointer. The laser only shows up when you fire. So it's not giving you help. It's actually helping you train, and it pays for itself in range and ammo fees. So right now you can go to iTargetPro.com, get 10% off, plus free shipping with promo code NEWS. Get you a laser bullet at iTargetPro.com. Before we move on to the next story, I just would like to point out on this whole college admissions cheating thing. Did you hear that Elizabeth Warren of all people said that she has zero sympathy for the college? She should have at least one 1024 seat. The self-awareness of these people is just unbelievable. Alright, so Pat, there was a, he's a man, right? Can you just explain this because with the transgender... The fluid thing, the non-dynamic thing. The pronouns, yeah, I get... Yeah, you don't want to offend him, and you won't by calling him a man now, because this guy is actually, he was an LGBTQQIA2 plus hero. Well, backbeat too. For a while. Because he was the first legal non-binary person in the United States. A judge declared him as such. And non-binary is you just don't have a gender. You just don't have a gender. You're not a man, you're not a woman, you're some third thing. An amoeba? I guess. It explains a lot about my cousin. So he went about for the last three years as a non-binary person, and he just came out and declared the fact that he has gone back to his former life as a man. He's a full-fledged man now. He doesn't want anything to do with the non-binary thing. He is... So does he have a penis? Yes, he does. Yes, he does. Okay, I'm not making a tough question. I'm not making a tough question. That's my hard-hitting journalistic question. And he's always had one. He's always had one. But for some reason, he wasn't a man. But he's gone back to pee and stand out. A couple of years ago when he had one. But he has now said, look, I had PTSD, and it messed me up, and I was going through a severe mental crisis. And all the doctors did that I went through was continue to make it worse for me. And so they played on his disease, on his gender dysphoria, and they encouraged him every step of the way to become this non-binary person. And so he did, because that's what he was pushed into. And he said, that's the danger of this situation right now, where everybody's afraid to just say, hey, you need some help. You're messed up right now. You are a man. Well, why don't you... Let's get you some help. Let's get you some psychiatric care. And apparently, the physician he went to just pushed him into this non-binary choice. And so he, to respond to all of the pressure that he was getting, had himself declared non-binary. But then he recovered, and now he's back to being a man, and it kind of shows you the hysteria that we're going through in this country right now with this gender fluid thing, and the fact that we've got a non-binary gender situation. There's no such thing. You're a man or you're a woman. And we were just heard the news the other day. Who was it? Deborah Messing. In order to celebrate National or International Women's Day, put out a picture of these cupcakes that were in the form of a vagina. And people got really hacked off. I'll get you the website right after this. But people were mad at her, and it wasn't because it was crass and crude, and their kids could look at it. It was because she didn't celebrate women without a vagina. Like, there are no women without a vagina. If you're a woman, you've got one! This is the best music I've ever had. What is a woman? It's kind of like the main qualification I feel for being a woman. Let me tell you. When I'm looking for one, let me just tell you. Just basically, do you think this guy after coming back out and saying, okay, forget it. I'm a man. Do you think he's getting hate mail? Oh, yes. He's getting trashed, right? Oh, yes. Which that in and of itself shows the hypocrisy. They don't want you to be who you want to be. They want you to be who they need you to be in order to fill the narrative. So it's complete hypocrisy. If this guy comes out and says, no, okay, look. I was messed up in the head. I'm wrong. This is what I am and they're going to go, oh, no, no. We need you to go back to me in whatever it was you were. You know, it's got to fit the narrative. Well, I mean, it's also, it's really dangerous when you have a medical community. I mean, these are people who are supposed to know. These are the people that we're supposed to be able to trust that they're going to look to science. You know, and they're going to look to studies that show that, you know, gender dysphoria is actually very rare and look at all of the statistics associated with, you know, higher levels of depression, of suicide, of anxiety, of all of these things. Why in the world would our trusted medical professionals be pushing people into that? I mean, if you can't trust the doctors, who can you trust? Yeah, because they've been breathing bad air. No, that's just, that's just the blacks in the panics. Yeah, I'm back in a minute. Chad was just saying this is the best news and why it matters ever. It continues in overtime.

So apparently if you're what I'm told is that you're in a dating market these days and you are a biological male and you refuse to consider dating someone who is also a biological male but self-identifies as a female. It's crazy. I'm told that for large swaths of the left these days, you are a transphobe for holding that stance. I'm president of the transphobe. That is unbelievable. For preferring sexual complementarity, the most rudimentary biological sense, you're a bigot. So if you are a biological male and a trans wants to date you, you must then prefer homosexuality essentially. Right. Yeah. Because no matter what they identify as, you identify them as a man, you don't want to be with them. So what a crazy place we find ourselves in here. And is this unbelievable? Is this, do you know, this is for this regardless of what parts you have down below? Right. Correct. You can be identifying as a woman, dress up as a woman, but still have a penis. This one. And you boys are transphobic for not wanting to have that kind. Oh, I'm transphobic in that regard. Let me tell you. You remember, you remember, like I've seen some good looking people. I've seen some good looking dudes out there, right? I mean, I'll come out and say it. I'm confident enough when I'm masculine. I've seen dudes in dresses that I was like, dang, that dude's got a nice butt. But let me tell you something. Whatever. Call me a bigot, a misogynist. I don't care. I like women. And let me tell you. We're learning good things out there. We're learning good things out there. Oh, it's interesting. But then I moved on. It never was a temptation when I saw that this dude, no matter how tiny he was in a dress, he had a head like a house cat. I'm like, no, it's a guy. There's a lump right there. You remember Crocodile Dundee when he's in the bar and he's sitting there. See, you can't tell these jokes anymore. Crocodile Dundee, the first movie, he's over there and he's talking to this lady all night long in the bar. His cab driver comes over and he's like, that's a guy. And he's like, no, he doesn't. No, it's a guy. He turns around, grabs him in the junk. And he's all offended. Oh my gosh, you know, in the bar, rups in laughter and stuff like that. There's one way to tell. Right. Grab him in the junk. Yeah. Just Donald Trump him. Oh, we went there today. All right, Chad, it's been nice having you on the program. Unfortunately, this will be the last time. Somebody call HR. This is what Evan wouldn't beck us out of town. But to add to that, we've covered this little boy several times on the show. His name is Desmond is amazing. His stage name. He is a drag kid. I believe he started when he was what? Six or something? He's 11 now. But yeah, he started when he was very, very little. More recently there he is. Little Desmond. Yeah, this is just really, really infuriating. He more recently was performing at the gay bar and having grown men throw dollar bills at him and hoot and holler at him. And somehow his parents are just like, yeah, this is totally fine. This is not child abuse at all. So apparently, the mother said that child protective services showed up at her home. That someone had called child protective services on them. And I'm like, are we supposed to feel sorry for you because it's about damn time that someone calls CPS on you. Is that not child abuse, Pat? Of course it is. Yeah, absolutely it is. To sexualize a child at that age, yeah, that's child abuse. I mean, maybe you could make the argument, which I'm not making. But just to play devil's advocate, maybe you could make the argument that allowing him to dress up, okay, he's wearing a dress, he's putting on makeup, it's not hurting anyone. But you don't send him to a gay club. Right. Right. Right. I mean. To perform in front of a bunch of grown men. You don't do that. Right. Because at 11, he's not supposed to understand sexual things. Right. This sexuality is not supposed to be part of the equation here. And they're thrusting him into this spotlight and sexualizing him. I can't imagine the issues he's going to have when he gets older. Josh. Children are supposed to be innocent. Okay. The preservation of the innocence of children is ultimately the role of the parents. They should be innocent, but they're not necessarily on their own. It's a parent's role. It's a parent's job to keep them there. So this to me just seems like a fundamental letdown in the role of parenting. Okay. A parent is not supposed to just let your child go and just perform for all sorts of potentially sexually hedonistic and, you know, risk- K stuff. It is your role to put your phone in the gas pedal and say no sometimes. I'm not a parent yet, but even I know this is what you're supposed to do. Right. You've got the basics down. Right, Josh. And this is, it is child abuse. And here's why I say outrageous things to get attention because, because you're, if you are bothered by say what Tucker Carlson said 10 years ago, you're a hypocrite because this stuff, they're parading this kid out on Good Morning America, you know, as a hero, basically, you're not outraged by the jokes that are made and things like this. You believe this, you agree with it, you defend it. It's a joke. I mean, it's, it's a tragic joke. Yeah. Pat. Yeah. I mean, CPS investigated this and found that there was no child abuse there. But if you spank your kid, you might lose your kid. Right. It doesn't make any sense. Yeah. And I mean, it's just bizarre to me that we're so, again, you know, we're supposed to be so inclusive and, you know, we're supposed to, you know, recognize that if he wants to dress up as a little girl, he wants to dress up as a little girl. But again, all of the statistics and all of the studies show that this is pushing him in a really, really dangerous direction. Medical professionals don't, don't, don't recognize that. Want to push the little kids. Want to give them hormones at a young age? I mean, it's just, it's, we live in a crazy world. Yeah. That's one of the points made by this guy who was declared the first non-binary person in America. He said, we're really doing a disservice to our kids to, to start them down this road at a very young age like Desmond the Amazing or whatever he goes by. And let me say, so, so like this guy, and I've said numerous things publicly that people want to come at me and they're mad at me and, you know, whatever. Look, this kid, I love you. This guy. I love you. This is not the person that I have the problem with. I don't, you're, you're struggling. You have something going on. My mother goes out to you. Who makes me mad are the psychologists and the therapists and the doctors and the parents and these folks. Those are the ones I get angry with. Yeah. Cause these people are, they really are victims. Yeah. Oh yeah, absolutely. I mean, that's, that's, that's your parents, that's the parents job. I mean, my son, right, I have 10 million pairs of shoes. He sees my shoe. Can I wear your shoes? Right. Can I, can I put on your makeup too? I'm putting on makeup all the time. Can I put on your makeup too? Well, no sweetheart, you can't put on my makeup because you boy and boys don't wear makeup. Oh wow. You're gonna make it. Oh wow. No, I, no, I would probably get pulled off to jail. CPS would show up at my door and not determine that they would determine that that was child abuse to not let my son, yet to not let my son identify the way that he wanted to identify at six. Yeah. I'm a horrible mother. That's happening in Canada. Like right now in Ontario, Canada, they are literally go, sending in CPS. To parents homes that are not affirming the child's idiosyncratic gender selection, whatever the heck that's even supposed to mean. That's literally happening in Canada. That's coming here in the next five, 10 years. Oh my gosh. So it goes Europe, so it goes Canada. You have it a couple of years, so it goes Americans. Idios, incredible. Wow. I don't know what it means either. Jay Leno had, he's come back out onto the spotlight. He had some things to say on late night shows today. Watch. Now, if people don't like your politics, everyone has to know your politics. When I kind of use Johnny's model, people couldn't figure out, well, you and your Republican friends, well, Mr. Leno, when you're a Democratic buddy, and I would get hate mail from both sides equally and I want you to go. Well, that's fabulous. That's exactly what I want. But when people see you as one sided, it just makes it tough. And plus, you know, I did it when Clinton was horny and Bush was dumb and it was just a little easier. It makes great point, doesn't he? Yeah, he does. I mean, that's why he lasted so long and he was number one for so long. It is. You know, because, and in fact, I don't know if people remember when Letterman first went to CBS. He was number one for the first two years, but he became an angry old man who spewed left wing ideology and Jay Leno kicked his butt for the next 15 to 20 years. That's why Jay was successful because he was doing a comedy show. Chad, your comedian. Well, people don't want laughter anymore. They want applause. And so we've gotten rid of being able to tell jokes. I say all the time, look, being able to mock somebody as part of the job description and I don't apologize for it. I don't care what your gender persuasion is with the color of your skin, if you're fat, skinny, white, girl boy, I don't care. We're going to make fun of all of you. In every place we're going to do that. The problem these days is these late night talk shows, Saturday Night Live and all these things, you have one punchline, Donald Trump. And that's it. That gets old. There's no dynamic to that and it's just not funny. Josh, are there any late night talk shows that are watchable for you? No. I mean, I used to enjoy David Letterman. Okay. Letterman was clearly of the left, but he was like a funny guy. He was more or less an equal opportunity offender. But Jay Leno, I mean, like you just said, Pat, I mean, that right there is why he was number one for so many years. Okay. He was an easygoing guy. He was making jokes about everyone. My whole thing when it comes to comedy is just being an equal opportunity offender. Okay. Yes. Yeah. Like even like Family Guy, which is obviously like a little wrong, whatever, they take shots at everyone. Right. Like no issue. Like take shots like whatever, like religion, like nations, whatever, whatever you want, as long as it's all encompassing. The problem is when you get your Stephen Colbert's The World, right? And they're literally just taking shots of One South of the Isle, Jimmy Kimmel, like you just, it just gets old, man. Like, like, we know you're a leftist. Like you don't need to remind us every single freakin' night. Right. So, comedy. Chad, you're out on the road again. Yeah. This weekend, I'm in Ramona, California on the 15th to 16th of March. So that's Friday and Saturday night. And then I want to encourage people, I'm headed over to L.A. to see the world premiere of Unplanned, the Unplanned movie there in Hollywood. So, I encourage people to pro-life movie. I think it is. Yeah. It sure is. Yeah. And the controversy there was they gave it an R rating. The MPAA gave it an R rating, which is interesting because they cited violence, which I don't know how you can perform violence on a blob of tissue. That's a great point. If it's violent, then it must be a life in there. Yeah. This movie comes out nationwide. At the end of March, I encourage everybody to go get it. I'm actually going to buy out the theater local to us and give people free tickets to make sure that it's full. We're not going to let it our rating stand in the way. So, good for you. For you. Thanks for doing that. And thank you, gentlemen, for being here. Yeah. Have a great weekend. We'll see you guys Monday. I'm going to miss Josh. Come on. Thanks for listening to the news and why it matters. We hope you enjoyed the podcast. If you'd like to watch the program, become a Blaze TV subscriber and start your free trial now at BlazeTV.com."
