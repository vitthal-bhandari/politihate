Experts on what they're talking about. This is the podcast for insights into the issues. China, bioterrorism, Medicare for all, in-depth discussions. Breaking it down into simple terms. We hold. We hold. We hold these truths. We hold these truths with Dan Crenshaw. All right, everybody. Welcome back. Got a great episode today with Ayan Hirsi Ali. I've been following her for a while. She's a fascinating background, very accomplished scholar, and really excited to have her on. Ayan, how are you doing today? I'm doing great. Thank you. Thank you for having me on. I'll just give a little bit of background. You were born in Somalia. You eventually settled in the Netherlands where you became a member of Dutch parliament. When did you move to the US? I moved to the US in 2006. Okay. Yeah. From there, you've been at AEI, the American Enterprise Institute. You were a fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School from 2016 to 2019. You were there when I was there. I didn't even know that. I should have known that. Yeah. Neither did I. I'm very sorry about that. Me too. Yeah, I would have. I paid pretty close. Maybe I did go to one of your talks, actually, because I mean, I have been following for you for a while, but kind of where we ran into each other might have run together. But you were also at the Hoover, or you were at the Hoover Institute right now. Another great place. You wrote a book called Infidel. This is an autobiography, New York Times Best Seller, and an additional book called Nomad and Heretic. And you currently have, you're also the founder of the AHA Foundation, which is dedicated to protecting women's rights and dedicated to ending female genital mutilation, forced in child marriages, and honor violence. So very accomplished, really have it have you on. I mean, you've written on a lot of things. It's not just your interesting background, but also what you call vochism. We'll get into that. Many politics and all of the above. But I want to delve back into your background. So very, very curious to hear how did you end up from in the Netherlands, were you a refugee out of Somalia, or what's your background? I detailed that in the book called Infidel, which was published in 2007. But basically, I was born in Somalia in 1969. And that is about nine years after Somalia gained independence. And for the first eight or so years of my life, Somalia was in complete turmoil. My father was engaged in politics. And it was the sort of politics of, you know, building or trying to build a nation that had become independent. And it was about seven, seven, eight years old. And then in 1969, Mohammed Siyad Barre, who was, he had Marxist leanings, but he was a junior in the newly founded military, Somalia military. And he seized power. And he started to kill people who are against him and throw some of them in prison. Luckily for us, he threw my father in prison. And while my father was in prison, we were able to escape with my mother and my siblings. And we left for Saudi Arabia. We lived there for one year. And then we were deported from there because they found out that my father, after he had escaped prison, and while in Saudi Arabia was actually engaged in politics when he was prohibited from doing that. And so they told us to get out. And we did get out. And the only country that would accept us at that point is Ethiopia. And we stayed there for a year and a half. And then in 1980, and at that time I was 10 years old, my family moved to Kenya. And I lived in Kenya until I was 22 years old. In 1992, my father, who had gone back to Ethiopia to fight for what he regarded as the true independence for Somalia, but the salvation of Somalia. He came back in 1992. And very quickly after that, he found a husband for me, which is completely in line with our own traditions and customs. And I didn't like the man that he found for me. And so, and this man was a Canadian citizen, Somali by birth, eighth or ninth in line as a cousin of mine. And on my way to Canada, I was in Germany. I found myself in Germany in July of 1992. And instead of complying with our family values, I decided to take a train from Germany and go to the Netherlands and ask for asylum. So that's basically my story. That's fascinating. And obviously, like I mentioned in the bio, you're a huge advocate against these forced marriages. So I'm curious, what's the relationship now with your family or your father? And are they still alive? I mean, how does that go after you asked for asylum in the Netherlands? So of course, the family was upset. My father was very upset. He brought me a letter disowning me. But in 1997, he was able to reconcile with me. My sister had also come to the Netherlands and he was getting on an age. My sister got ill in the Netherlands and I was the only person really looking after her. So he figured that maybe it was better instead of living in England, he felt powerless to try and control me from Kenya while I lived in Holland. And we reconciled. He forgave me for running away from this man. But then in 2001, in 2001, 911 happened. And back then I was working for the think tank with the Labour Party. This is in the Netherlands. And all my colleagues were saying that 911 happened because of American foreign policy, Israeli foreign policy, colonialism. They had all sorts of reasons to explain away what I thought was the real thing. And the real thing is that these 19 men who attacked us, what driven by their conviction, their religious conviction, when I explained to them that as a teenager, I actually was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. I used to subscribe to this doctrine. And what we were taught was if you wanted to achieve the criminal purity, especially if you're a young man, you subscribe to jihad and you try to fight a holy war against the infidels. I also continued, aside from my analysis of what happened in 911, I was asked by the Labour Party to look into why communities, Muslim communities that had come to the Netherlands about three or four decades before myself were so poorly assimilated. And there they used the word integrated, not speaking the language under employed school dropouts over represented in prisons and all that. And so when I looked into it, I said, look, as long as we continue, Muslim communities continue to subjugate their women and keep them locked up and force them into marriage as children with people they've never seen before, the problem of not integrating will continue. And my father, who was in London at that time, he left Kenya and he moved to London with his first wife. He was very, very upset again. And this is the second time that I'm upsetting him. And at some point it came out. I had inadvertently said in a radio interview that actually I was no longer a Muslim. And you can imagine how that was received by my father in the wider community. And now he was getting death threats because he was doing nothing about my misbehavior, misconduct as they saw his blasphemy and fidelity. And so he tried to persuade me over the phone to drop everything, declare myself a Muslim again and beg for forgiveness. And I didn't do that. And so from then on our relationship was really tense until in 2008, he got ill, he got leukemia and he passed away. But he did allow me to visit him at the hospital. And he couldn't talk, he was an eventy laser. But he held my hand and he squeezed it. And I think, and I've said this, this is the subject, part of the subject of nomad, is that the love between a parent and a child is often stronger than any kind of doctrine. And my father proved that. He's proved it to me. That is great to hear. That is a heartwarming story. There's, you've, I mean, your background is just incredible. How did you end up in the Dutch parliament? I mean, that's, you know, from basically claiming asylum in Holland to running for parliament. And what was that path like? So the first thing is, you know, I went to the Netherlands and learned Dutch and did a few odd jobs here and there, whatever I could get. And then I wanted to study political science. I really wanted to understand why the Netherlands and other Western countries were different from the countries I had lived in before. And when I sought admission to the University of Leiden, luckily for me, they granted me that. And I got my master's degree in political science in the year 2000. And in 2001, I started to work for this Labour Party think tank that I was just telling me about. And then I started to take these positions on what happened in 911 and immigration, the position of women, Islam in Europe and the Labour Party, which is center left, was spooked by all of this. But the freedom, let's just call them the sort of free market type of party, which was then in the opposition. They offered to put me on the list. We have a list system in the Netherlands. They offered to put me on the list for parliament where Nellie Cruz, who was a prominent woman back then and later became an EU commissioner. She persuaded me and I think she persuaded her own party that it was useless to talk about these things in think tanks. Instead, these were practical things that needed to be done through the allocation of resources and through legislation. So that's how I found my way into the Dutch parliament. And what you said earlier about the, and I wanted to head on, you said a lot of things that I want to get to when 911 happened. And there was this tendency to always for Westerners to blame ourselves. You know, in the Dutch case, I guess, blame American foreign policy. I've lived around the world. I see that all the time. It's always about that. But I see it on our campuses too constantly. We're always asking, what did we do wrong? And I point out to people, you know, if you're looking at Osama bin Laden in particular, there was no moment that we wronged this person. In fact, you know, it was US forces helping the Maja Hadin against the Soviets in Afghanistan in the 1980s. It was the first Gulf War that we sent troops to defend his homeland of Saudi Arabia against invasion from Saddam Hussein. You cannot rationalize in a materialistic way why they do what they do and why they hate us so much. And this is so difficult for Westerners to comprehend, it seems. And this is especially true for the left, for whatever reason, the liberal disposition always trying to find fault in ourselves instead of the people who seek to do us harm. Well, yeah, I mean, I've just like you, I'm almost always amazed at the conclusions, the logical conclusions that some of the Western pundits reach when it comes to analyzing and understanding the basic tenets of political Islam. You know, Magid Nawaz calls it Islamism. And Islamists really don't care about Westerners seeking atonement for their past misdeeds. Or the cynical professors in universities in the West who for whatever reason are indoctrinating young people with ideas about why America is irredeemably racist and terrible. They don't care about any of that. Their mission is to Islamize the world as fast as they can through peaceful means which they call Dawa, that is the proselytizing and the organizing. And if that fails them through jihad and individuals like Ben Laden and the organization he created al-Qaeda, that is what they're seeking. They don't care. And as you've seen often enough when Westerners are left in a very idealistic way, when they go and think that they can prove to them that they are the good ones, they have their heads cut off. And you know, we've seen this over and over and over again. It's the inability of post-Christian Western societies to understand the potent power of religion. Right. Does this get into the question of multiculturalism and this sort of this kind of moral relativism that like you said, I think it's a great phrase you use, the post-Christian Western society. Because using the word post-Christian I think it's important because it implies that we've sort of done away with absolutes of right and wrong. And therefore, we don't even know what we're defending, right? We don't even know what we're defending ourselves against because there is no right and wrong in a post-Christian world. There's just your opinion and there's sort of the political whims of the moment. And this gets into that conversation of multiculturalism. The other thing you mentioned about your experiences in Holland is they asked you to help them with the integration. And I know in Europe there's constant tension with Muslim populations there in Europe. I don't know that we experience it the same way in the United States. I'd like to think that we don't. I think that we integrate better. I go and visit Moss here in my district. I enjoy it very much. I've traveled to Muslim countries. I have an affinity for Muslim people. I don't see that same tension boil up as much here. Curious what your thoughts on that are. And is Europe making strides towards that and towards that integration? Or what else needs to be solved to fix that problem? So I think first I'll start by saying I disagree with you in the post-Christian Western societies, Europe, America and the others. It's not that there is no longer a distinction between rights and wrong and that morality has disappeared. That's not the case. I think what you have are the classical liberals who believe that the issue of rights and wrong is there, but what is wrong when it comes to harming others has been legislated and that we've developed norms and values so that people really know and understand what is wrong and they can distinguish between the two. But then that situation is taken for granted. And then on the other side, again secular, you have the post-modernists. And the post-modernists are the ones who are upset with modernity. They're upset with the classical liberals. They obviously have abandoned Christianity as a moral compass. They've reached these crazy conclusions that there is no objective truth, that the only structures and institutions we are left with, structures and institutions of power, and that there is then this oppressor, the white heterosexual male, who is using these structures to continue to oppress everyone else. And then the language, even the English language, the language that we speak itself is the tool of the oppressor. All of this has been written down in great detail by Helen Placross. She's editing chief of area magazine, the United Kingdom and James Lindsey, who's a mathematician here. And this is, it's very interesting to see these various post-modernists theories or screens of theories. Let's start out in universities. And on really the fringe side of universities, no one ever took them seriously. In the time that I was fighting for the emancipation of Muslim women, the integration of Muslim minorities into European societies, this was all background noise. And they would claim, these are the post-modernists, they would claim, why do you want to impose Eurocentric and colonialist values on these women? In other words, these women were just fine. You think they're oppressed, but they don't think of themselves as oppressed. Now, we're talking about children who have been forced into marriage. We're talking about female genital mutilation. We're talking about honor violence and honor claims. And yet, they want, instead of talking about universal human rights, the way classical liberals do, what is our common humanity? They would instead make everything into, turn everything into groups, ethnic groups or Muslim groups. And the Islamists living in Europe exploited this situation. So for me, it was that background noise. I didn't have to fight cancel culture from the perspective of, from the perspective that you would have to, you would have, as a white man, you would have to deal with cancel culture. For me, it was what they called Islamophobia. That was my big thing. And anyway, I didn't, done, I didn't really think that this thing would spread out of these universities and out of multiculturalism and, you know, what we do with the up-origines and Native Americans and Muslim immigrants. I didn't think it would then spread far and wide to all of society. And that's where we are now. Yeah. And a lot of us, a lot of us wondered that because for those of us following this for, you know, the last decade or so, we see this boil up on the campuses. And we wrongfully assumed that when these kids made it into the real world, that the real world would change them. But in reality, they've changed the real world. They've, they've changed the culture of corporations, which have immense power, whether it's because of their market or because of their, you know, just general voice in the public sphere, in Hollywood, in the media. And it's hard to know what it's based on, right? Like, and it gets back to this, this, this conversation about truth and what is true and what isn't, what is right and what is wrong and what are universal values and what aren't. And it's difficult to understand what it even stands for except for itself. You know, and it's difficult to understand what, what is on the other side of this, of this, this sort of doctrine that they're perpetuating. It's frightening just to say the least. Yeah. And also you, you, you said corporations and universities and, you know, K to 12 education now, it's spread everywhere. But it's also seeped into the military, which makes it incredibly dangerous. That is true. And it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, It's. Okay, Mm hmm. So people be. really sift through their ideas and their goals, their stated political agenda, what you see is not that they want to fix that injustice. What they're saying is they want to dismantle the entire system. Right. They want power for their own doctrine. They want power for their own doctrine, but then you have to go even one step further and ask yourself, what are they going to do with that power then? When they get let's assume we give them that power. Let's assume we give power to Black Lives Matter as an organization, as a movement. What are they going to do with it? When you read what is on their website, they say that they're going to do with it. I mean, it's really creepy. They just want to dismantle, they want to destroy, they want to pull down statues, they want to rename everything. And it's not clear to me what they want to replace it with. Yeah, I say this a lot. Like if you're going to if you're going to protest the flag and the the basic idea of America, then I would think that there's something on the other side of that, but they do not they do not dictate what that is. And that in itself, I think subverts the entire the entire movement to a degree because the entire point of protesting something is this idea that you would stop protesting at a certain point where you to see a change. But that's actually not the point. The point is just power. Yeah, it's it's more of a hostage crisis. It's and we're all being taken hostage. So if you start throwing around accusations like racism and white supremacy, I think the first step would be to define what racism is. They don't want to define what racism is. The all the definition that we had that led to actual changes for Black people and other people of color. They've rejected that out of hand. They say now racism is everywhere. Right. In between the cracks, it's under your bed. Every but every white person is faces. If every white person is faces, then you would come with them. No one is. So the time becomes so promiscuous, it becomes meaningless. And that is the point, I think. I think they just want to render our language meaningless so that they can keep talking about these power structures and these power relations and annihilate the idea that human beings can relate to one another in more ways than one. Right. And in very complex ways. Right. I agree. I think that is the point. So going back to your background, then why did you decide to come to the United States? I mean, you clearly had a quite a career in Holland. So why come to the US? Well, it's also a little bit complicated. Two things happened. First, I was while in Parliament as a politician, I felt that I didn't want to have a second. I didn't want to hunt for office a second term. And my term was going to end in May of 2007. I was living with the kind of security that it's very difficult to describe. There was no quality of life for me being moved from safe house to safe house. Really? Always surrounded by armed men. Who's targeting you? Who's targeting you in Holland? We had a group, relatively small group of very dedicated jihadi's in Holland. And who had sworn to kill me. And they killed my friend Theo Fungal because he made a film with me called submission just really a 10 minutes. You'd say you would even think of it more as a trailer plus that describes why Islam in the Quran, and I only used Quranic verses, why women were seen as inferior and how they were subjugated. And they were so offended these jihadi's us to declare Theo a target myself, a target and others. They wanted to blow up the parliament. They wanted to blow up courts, stuff like that. And when I say dedicated, I mean, they had these very clear plots to carry out. Matter and I accepted, you know, if you're a member of the Dutch Parliament, it would be horrific if you then were killed in this way. And so the alternative was to have and live with this heavy, heavy, heavy security. And the way that was handled, I didn't spend any time anywhere for more than two or three weeks. And finally, I found a house that was that met the security requirements of the government. And my neighbors went to court. And the district court, the lower court said that I they had no rights to kick me out. So I could live there. But the appellate court said they had their their human rights were violated. So I had to be kicked out. And so I started looking for jobs in the United States and actually found a job with the American Enterprise Institute. But then in May of 2006, the Minister for Immigration and Integration for political reasons decided to take my Dutch citizenship away. And that accelerated things. And that's how I ended up in the United States. So that's fascinating. So does does that mean there is does that mean the the the elements of the Dutch government were also working against you from your I mean, with your own party, you were on a center left party. And you know, is it because of the left tendencies to engage in this kind of multiculturalism? And you know, these are what I would call formerly classical liberals that have become a liberal over time. And were they working against you as well? I mean, did you feel like you just had no friends over there at a certain point? I think the woman who took away my citizenship was acting really only on a personal level, to be honest with you. I wish I could tell you some cosmic story about some injustices that was done to me in Holland. But the real injustice was that and this is more different from what we are seeing in other developed nations. The self imposed political correctness that, you know, minorities should be given license to violence, our norms and rules, and the human rights of women and children, especially within Muslim communities. But this woman was not driven by any of that. I think she took it was really quite personal. She had asked me, I think she wanted to divide the party and take her, you know, get a few people to go with her so that she could be the leader and I refused to do that. And this was my punishment. And she was swiftly punished for that. The entire party, almost the whole country came together to say, you have to give the citizenship back. And it was given back to me. But then that led to the collapse of the government in 2006. Really? Wow. That's just fascinating. It's like almost like a house of cards. And I'll say, you know, how in America we say we are polarized, we are polarized. Well, I know how polarized every every liberal Western country is that is in 2006, things were in Holland, just as bad as they are in America. Really? And in Holland, the Netherlands is a country that prides itself on consensus. And so it's fascinating to watch these developments. How do you see the future of Europe and these culture wars that are occurring in Europe? Do you see it improving or falling apart? I mean, there really is this in Western civilization, this sort of self-deprecating trend that is frightening that we don't want to stand up for our own values. Do you see that in Europe? And how is that going to go? I think I would not use the phrase falling apart. What is happening in Europe more is an erosion of the Europe that we know that I came to in 1992. My next book is called Pray. And the subtitle is Islam, Immigration and the Rights of Women. And what I'm seeing, back in the 1990s and 2000s, when we talked about women whose rights were compromised, we were talking about immigrant women, mostly Muslim women. Today in 2020, because of immigration, we're talking about the rights of all women, women in the public square. So look at countries like Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, where they are targeted arbitrarily by men who come from countries where they're not used to respecting women, not used to seeing women on the streets, etc. And the institutions of law and order that are supposed to fix this, do something about it, are not doing about it, because their hands are tied by this self-imposed political correctness. And so what you see then is an erosion of rights. It's the paint, some of my American friends describe Europe as a museum. Well, even if it's a museum, you need to, it needs upkeep, right? It needs maintenance. And so sometimes you would think of Europe as a house where the paint is peeling off, things are slowly rotting away. And at times, it feels like no one is doing anything about it. At other times, you know, just last week, the president of France declared war on Islamist separatism. And then, you know, you start to think, is he just being a cynical politician who just looking at 2022 for his reelection, or does he really mean it? We'll see. I've had those statements before. I've had Angela Merkel and David Cameron declare multiculturalism is dead. It doesn't work. We're going to change things. And then I haven't seen a lot of change. Brexit happened. All sorts of political parties, populist political parties, right-wing political parties, far right-wing political parties are emerging in Europe. Maybe it is through these popular demands that the politicians will be forced to reimagine and rethink their ways. And at other times, you know, the erosion continues. I'm watching a country called Sweden very closely to see what they are going to do about the policies of the past 30 years. And in America, so you come to America, you started here at AEI? Yes, I started at AEI, which for me was a fantastic place. And welcomed me even before I had stepped down. I had decided to give up my seat in Parliament in Holland. And I was able to publish anything I wanted to publish, go on any forum. And all I found was institutional encouragement from then-President, Mr. Muth, and later-President Arthur Brooks, even though I didn't work. I wasn't at the AEI for very long while Arthur was there. Mm-hmm. And I met great people who were friends to this day, very close friends to this day. So I just want to say my experience, my life as an individual here in America, has been happier, more free. I couldn't be happier, honestly. It's just been wonderful. But of course, I'm also looking at these other developments in our country. Yes, I decided to become an American citizen wholeheartedly, work on my English, make friends, you know, what you're supposed to do as an immigrant. As an immigrant, you choose to come here. So you do your best to become a part of the fabric of society. And I haven't had. I've had an easier time than most immigrants I have to say. What do you think about, um, so Representative Ilhan Omar, one of my colleagues, a similar background, came from a war towards Somalia and became an asylum asylum recipient here in the US. And of course, ran for Congress, like really lived the American dream, which takes a very different approach to Americanism and Western culture than you do. You know, the question is, is it because of her background that she takes that view? Or is it, or is she really just perpetuating the, this of the Western leftism and that sort of cult of leftism that has occurred here? I mean, which is it? It would seem to me that it's more that she's, that she's repeating the cult of leftism more so than than anything from her background. It could be both. I've not met Ilhan Omar. I hate diagnosing people from a distance. I've never sat down with her. I never had a conversation with her. So the Ilhan Omar I know is really the woman in, you know, through public, the publicity sources. My guess would be on the one hand, like I was, you know, when in my teens, I was very much influenced by the Islamists, mainly those who came to influence us, members of the Muslim Brotherhood. And so we got a lot, we got plenty of anti-Americanism, anti-Western propaganda to last us a life. But if you then combine, if you then come to America and you fall into the hands of the woke, that's pretty unfortunate. And so you could, I could see why you can be blind or blinded to the good fortune of coming here and bringing your family here and raising your family here and being celebrated and being elected into the House of Representatives. And now you are in the position of actually legislating, allocating resources. You're celebrated and you're standing there saying, we must dismantle everything. That is Jerry. But I also hear during the conventions, Michelle Obama, who's a fast lady for eight years, say the same things. I hear, you know, Vice Presidential nominee Kamala Harris saying, you know, our country is one of systemic racism. It is, it's fascinating to watch these things, peer these people say these things. Opera Wiffery just heard a book, her pick of the book that America is a, what did she call it? It was, the book is written by somebody who's never accompanied a peer or a pyre from Ghana. And we're being, America is now a caste system. So it's with fascination that we watch these things and say, where did it come from? Is this really, is this for real or will I pinch myself and wake up, I think, or it was all a big joke? Yeah, and it's like what we were talking about before. It's like, what's the point of it? You know, like where is the good in, in describing America this way, our culture, our institutions as systemically oppressive? You know, if there's a point to it, because we have movements in this country where there was clearly a point to it, you know, ending the civil war, there was a clear point to that, right? There's clear, there's clear and definable systemic injustice. And so we fought a war to stop it. The civil rights movement was exactly the same. There was very clear and definable systemic injustice. And, and that movement was, was designed to stop that. There was something on the other side of it. It's very concerning that we don't see anything on the other side of it, except, except the goal, the goal itself seems to be resentment and bitterness and division. And I don't understand that goal. It's scary. Well, it is, I thought of it, I described it as Marxist and James Lindsay, whom I talked about earlier, Helen Plakros, they actually, it's not Marxist because Marxism was material, right? This is not material, they call it neo-Marxist. It's the only goal seems to be the obliteration of the system. And there's no desire to replace to anything. And I agree with you back in the day. And this is again what makes what in my view makes America unique is when this conversation starts to emerge about the immorality of slavery, it doesn't just remain a conversation. Of course, at that point, slavery is systemic and structural. But we fight war. And those who want to liberate fellow human beings, they win the war, they get to make the laws. It's the same with the civil rights movement. When there is true and real segregation and you're black and you're not allowed here and you're not allowed there, you can't take the loans out, you can't send your kids to schools and so on. These things, we had a big fight about it. And those who wanted the civil rights, they won. And we did away with all of that. And we had to obviously change. You can't change a society simply by changing the laws and the books. You have to change everything else along with it, the language, the values, the norms, etc. It has all happened. Is there still more injustice and racial inequality? Yes, it is pointed out, let's use our founding principles to make those changes. But they're saying the founding principles themselves are going and they're litigating people in the past and using the moral framework of today, pulling down statues, they're overlooking the fact they're calling us Nazis in the United States of America when we actually fought Nazism and sacrificed blood and treasure to a magnitude they've never seen before to stop Nazism. And yet the country being maligned and smeared as truly cases. Now, you can imagine the kind of, when you have this kind of internal turmoil, you can imagine the kind of external attacks you invite. What is China going to do to us or Russia or the Islamists, you name it, we're just making it way too easy, because we no longer have the moral diagram. We are proclaiming from our investors that we are irredeemably sinful and racist. It's actually frightening. Yeah, we make it very easy on our adversaries. If you're in the information operations, units of the Russians or the Chinese, and I know a lot about this, I spent time in the intelligence community, so I understand how these operations go. It's the easiest thing in the world to create divisions in a society like ours when all you have to do is just the smallest Facebook post. I mean, the amount of resources they have to use are very small to just foment the kind of divisions that we have here. And I love the article we wrote in the Wall Street Journal, titled what Islamists and wokists have in common. And you define wokism as their ideology goes by many names, cancel culture, social justice, critical race theory, intersectionality, for simplicity, we will call it wokism. I like that. I think that about sums it up. And you have a really interesting argument on comparing the two. They're obviously not exactly the same. And you see, you were not about to equate wokism in Islamism. You say Islamism is a militant strain of an ancient faith. It's adherence, have a coherent sense of what God wants him to achieve on earth to earn rewards in the afterlife. Wokism is in many ways a Marxist creed. It offers no hereafter. Wokism divides society into myriad identities, whereas Islamist segregation is simpler. Believers and unbelievers, men and women. So this kind of goes into what we were talking about before. It's problematic. At least we know what his lummists want. We really have no idea what wokism wants. Yeah. That is true. And also, wokism is to a certain degree headless. So we just talked about earlier about al-Qaeda, where they had Osama bin Laden as their head. You know, you go to ISIS, they had Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi with wokism. And I know a lot of people think, a lot of my colleagues think, well, Islam has no hope. So in many ways, it's also headless. But that's not true. Over the centuries, we've had all the different, the death of Muhammad. We've had all these various Salis. I think you pronounce it as Caliphs. But wokism has no Caliphs. Right. Could you point out who the leader is? No, no. There's no direction. Maybe some socialists in their 20s, but that's about it. That's about it. It's very diffused. And in that sense, it can be in some ways, it makes it easier to defeat. But in other ways, it also makes it harder, because it's very difficult to pinpoint who the leadership is. And what they're, you know, if we were to say, let's sit down and negotiate with them, or have a conversation with them, it's very difficult to pinpoint who exactly speaks for them. And the prominent individuals like Robin D'Angelo, they don't make any sense. No. And this guy, Abraham X. Kendi, he doesn't make any sense to me. The woman Kimberly Crenshaw, I hope you're not family. No, no, I've written about her, though. It's kind of ironic. Yeah. She's the, yeah, she wrote about intersectionality. Well, I can imagine, last night I was watching her TED talk, and I thought, well, I can imagine sitting down with her and having a conversation with her and saying, what would you like to achieve that? Well, here's what we have achieved through our existing institutions and principles. What would you like to change? But what I see, and I really encourage everyone on your, who's listening to us to go to this TED talk and watch it. What she does is she has this, she fires people up on an emotional level. Emotions are given to you with no context. And she makes it look like the police are just going to go to women's homes, like women's homes and shoot them. But if let's be charitable and say, you know, Miss Crenshaw, just tell us what should we do? How can we fix this? And then there are others. But usually it is, what do they want when you achieve power? You know, I think we should always start from the, from the back end. This is what the question I used to get. When you get, you want Muslim women to be emancipated. What is it that you want for them then? And I'd have to be forced to say I want them to, when they, I want them to finish school, I want them to be allowed equal opportunity to go and find jobs and work. And I'd like them to keep the salaries that they make very concrete. Right. I'm not going to destroy the system. I'm saying I want these women, I want the system. I'm criticizing the system because the system is not protecting these women. But what would it look like if they are protected? And I think we should hold the work to some of these complete questions. What exactly would you like to achieve? Yeah, I think that's right. They're utopianists by nature, right? And so, you know, and utopian in Greek means no place. It's an impossible achievement. And again, it's kind of the goal, right? Because if they were ever to achieve a, let's call it a manageable level of inequality, then well, then they would have no reason to be vying for power anymore, right? They would, they would have nothing to run on for their next election. And that's the entire point. Yeah, the problem would be solved. So what they're running on is they're corrupting the language, they're corrupting our perception of power, they're corrupting our sense of what we perceive as knowledge and objective truth. And the more they do that, I got an article sent by a friend this weekend who said, it's racist to teach black kids English, because English is the language of the oppressor. So what exactly do you want to teach them then, and teach them in? And that, or we both said, well, that creates an underclass, a prominent underclass that you are then supposed to condescend to. And vulnerability, you violate and exploit. And I think ultimately, that's probably where we are. But we do have to expose it. Right. It's the language of compassion, but it only results in control. And I think that that is the point. You shared a, you shared an article on Twitter in August, which I don't know when this article came out, I'd have to click on it, the cancel culture checklist, six signs that show you're not being criticized, you're being canceled. This is, it's such a great checklist, because it's, it is important, because the right gets, gets accused of cancel culture to the left likes to use our own words against us sometimes. But it's like, no, we're just criticizing like there's, there's a difference between open and honest debate and making real objective arguments, and just canceling. And I love to this checklist. There's, there's, there's six things to look out for that really define what cancel culture is. Maybe I'll just go through them real quick and then let you kind of respond to it. One, punitiveness. So are people denouncing you to your employer, your professional groups, your social connections, or being blacklisted from jobs and social opportunities, etc. Number two, de-platforming, or de-platforming, are our campaigners attempting to prevent you from publishing or giving speeches or attending meetings, or just get you kicked off a Twitter. Number three, organization does criticism appear to be organized and targeted? Number four, secondary boycotts is there, is there explicit or implicit threats that people who support you will get the same punitive treatment that you're receiving? Five, moral grandstanding is the tone of the discourse at hominem, repetitive, ritualistic, posturing, accusatory, outraged, are people flattening distinctions, demonizing you, slinging inflammatory labels and engaging in moral one one, an ombudsman ship, and ignoring what you're actually saying, more importantly. And six, truthfulness, are the things even accurate, or are they just lying, or are they just hurling insults? And I always say, if you have to do an insult me, it's a pretty good indication you don't have a very good argument to make. Yeah, I mean, that you did. And now you have to ask yourself why are all these tools being deployed and against home? These are the tools of silencing. They have new names, like deep platforming and that sort of thing, truthiness. But even groups have relied on similar tools to pick on and silence others. And these are all tools of silencing of censorship, censorship upon censorship. And then you say, but why? This is every single time I read it out, work is in, I just want to ask them, what would you like to achieve? Right, it keeps getting back to that. We don't seem to have a good answer for it. It's very troubling. We do have a good answer for it. They're nihilists. We have a good answer. It's been answered. I mean, if you've read philosophers such as Rousseau and the way he inspired many, many people in his time and beyond, this is the way I like to think about it. We in the especially in the West, we like to think of ourselves as rational human beings. And we think that reason dominates. But I also think that it's not just reason, and a lot has been written on this. People are romantic. They're utopian, they're irrational. Yeah, by nature. Yeah, think about all these new age religions. Think about the sprouting of cults. And most of most often these things happen when we are in a relatively good place. You know, people are living a little longer, making more. There are barely any outside threats. And that's when people start to give in and give way to their most irrational, civilization, hating impulses. Yeah. And starts to fall in love with the so-called novel savage. And there was a friend of mine who I just sandal from Australia. And he called it romantic primitivism. So that problem is going to remain with us as long as we are humans. It's just part of us. And I think this is a new surge of such romantic primitivism. They want to bring everything down. Right. I fully agree with that. I tell people that this isn't really new, this movement we're seeing, it's not new. You mentioned Rousseau. This was deeply embedded in his own philosophy and the French Revolution. This idea that everything must be torn down and started over. Like there's no common knowledge that we've derived from thousands of years of history and culture passed down through generations. It's all nonsense. It's all oppressive. And they can always make the argument because anytime you can anecdotally point out some kind of injustice. And their argument is that if there's any injustice, then it's an indicator that the entire system is corrupt from within. And so you can always make this argument. And to your point, it's extremely intoxicating, especially for the young idealist. The young romanticized idealist, who, you know, let's give them some credit and say they honestly feel compassion and hope and idealism. But they're easily, they're the easiest target for this sort of language. The easiest target. Yeah. And I thought in the West, we had found ways out of that by giving them sports, where they can go and play and be stars and cheer and so on. Or I thought we also gave them something else to be utopian about entertainment, again, where they can start and cheer. But all those institutions, both sports and entertainment have been infiltrated by the workers. So you have Hollywood just too terrified to do anything. And these men, I'm not, I'm a woman and I'm not particularly a fan of any. I mean, I think men playing sports is a good thing because it gets them out of my way. But these sports stars taking the knee. And these kinds of things like what makes work is sinister and insidious is that they have taken to not only taking down, you know, they scream, defund the police and they're taking statues down. But they've also looked into and decided to take over the institutions of entertainment. How do you keep young men, especially young women too, but young men occupied and preoccupied? How do they channel those energies that they have? I thought the West had an answer to that. But now even those institutions are being infiltrated, being politicized, politicized. That's the word politicized. You know, if you want to just have some downtime and you want to watch baseball, American football, soccer, you can't do that anymore without being confronted with some kind of political black and white cut show. Yeah, it's extremely divisive. I mean, to your point, when we can't share our pop culture anymore, it's hard to know what we share when we've politicized everything. I know you don't have a whole lot more time and I want to get back to again, your other area of expertise outside of American wokism, which is which is Islamism. You know, again, I have a lot of experience. I've worked with Muslims. I think some of the greatest heroes I know are Muslims who have defended our country and our ideals, the things that we stand for overseas. You know, if I've watched them fight right alongside me, you know, that obviously you're typical Muslim American. I think wants to embody the same American values that you and I hold hold dear. But you write about different strains of and so it's important to distinguish what you mean by Islamism from, from, I think, your your individual Muslim, a person of Muslim faith. And I know that you do. But you you have you you you talk about three different strains in your book, Heretic, Mecca Muslims, which are the majority who are tolerant and passive, which is probably the type of Muslim that I'm describing that I would know. Then you talk about Medina Muslims, jihadist authoritarians, and modifying Muslims, modernizing reformers. So the real question is, what is that what does that distinction look like in America? And who's winning the overall battle for the future of Islam? Wow. So that again, the subject of the book, Heretic, the last book, which I think was published in 2015. I would say the majority of Muslims in America and elsewhere the Mecca Muslims, they don't give any thought to their religious identity. They just are, you know, the way you are a Christian, or people around me right now are Christians, but they're not all over the place talking about Christianity all the time, not proselytizing, not declaring that you choose between Christianity and infidelity and so on, which is what the second group is. The second group is about not they're not just Muslims, they don't see Islam as their faith, they see Islam as political too, to achieve power in the way that they have understood the faith, the after the final purity. And then after we've been subjected, you know, for me, it started in a dramatic way on 9-11, 2001, and I think for most Americans, it's the same case. But for many people in the Middle East and South Asia, they've had to live with Islamists, those who use Islam as a political tool for decades and decades of not centuries. And so the Medina Muslims have been annoying ordinary Mecca Muslims for a long time. And out of that emerged group number three. And group number three is forest to sit down and do what the Medina Muslims do. That is start to read scripture, to read the Quran, the hadith, the Sira, the Sira is the biography of Muhammad. And they then come out saying, some of these tenets are just they're unsustainable. It's not going to work, it's only going to lead to bloodbath. So let's just change them, modify, or see them in a historical context. Now, in the case of America, I had a conversation with Daniel Pipes and later on, he wrote that in his Wall Street Journal piece, he's published it, but he has seen some data where he says, about 100,000 Muslim Americans leave the faith of Islam and become something else. Some of them become atheists, some of them become Christians, some of them become priests, but they leave the faith. They are so critical and so disillusioned disappointed they get out. But he also said, a fresh 100,000 people are converted to the faith. So the Medina, the activism of the Medina Muslims is still quite potent in America. And I can tell you from what I've seen that they look for young, impressionable, and vulnerable communities that they can easily convert to Islam. I don't want to keep harping on workism, but if you are disappointed in workism, you would be a very easy target for the radical Islam is to give you a more solid faith. So that is our, I would say, this is what I would now say about America. Right, and so it kind of all comes back together. It's all part of an interesting strain. And I think I think the common thread seems to be victimhood ideology. Right. If you're if you're disillusioned, if you if you see disparities around you, then you seek an explanation for that. And there's political opportunists, whether they're in the form of the Islamists that you talk about, or whether it's in the form of wokism, that seek to take advantage of that and then say, you know, all you have to do is give us power and all of the disparities, all of the injustices of the world go away. I have seen booklets, that are booklets that's, uh, islam is proselytizing in America. And, uh, it almost always starts with America is actually a fine place to find a job, etc. So in a materialistic way, America will give you something. But after a certain point, America is morally bankrupt. And they build on these narratives that we are very system oppressors. And they build on some of the social issues we have, you know, dependence on drugs and alcohol, the exploitation of women, human trafficking, that sort of thing. And they say, you see, that is because of America's moral bankruptcy. And here is a moral framework that will set it all rights. All you have to say is, I said, I'm hammered at a sooner law. I witness or I bear witness that there is no God, but Allah and Muhammad is his prophet. And once they get you to that point, what they haven't told you is, if you then in time become disillusioned with the faith that they've introduced you to, and you get out, or you try to get out what the consequences are. Right. And I guess that's where the darker side comes. And you know, you would think, and maybe not in that extreme sense of Islamism, but you would think that we'd have a lot more in common as a Christian. I would believe we have a lot more in common with Muslims in America, because the entire point is to establish a moral framework of right and wrong. And you know, and that's, that's, you know, our founders did say that. They're like, you can't have, this constitution is inadequate for anybody but a moral and religious people. So we should be on the same page in many ways, wouldn't you think? I think we should. But again, we can only be on the same page. If we speak the same language, if we take the time to define what it is that we're saying and talking about, and that entails a good faith, and that you're not engaging in equification and ambiguity. And it also entails in the respect for each other's perspectives. Again, another source of good faith, it entails civility. You know, I've had a conversation with you. You see things differently. I'm going to leave it at that. I'm not going to declare war on your plot to take your job away or kick you out of your home or any of that, you know, not going to bully you. And again, that is, if you carry on in this sense, I'll say to me the philosophy that I find the most appealing is that of classical liberalism, where we think we've achieved that. And the only weakness of classical liberalism is that there is no promise of a utopia. There's no promise of something that transcends your reason. And you can get yourself lost by going to the opera or in a game or something else. But there's nothing we're offering. We don't offer what the promise of Jesus Christ offers or the promise of, you know, once you're given your life to jihad, which you're going to find in the afterlife. That void is there. I mean, I witness it, but I don't have, I don't have an answer really. But ultimately, I would say you look at the society like America, even now, I almost divided it, we're living crazy times. Still, you see people, regardless of their color, skin color, faith, coming out and helping one another, being there for one another. So we still have it, but we have to hang on to it. Right. And if you talk about it more in our political discussions and our pop culture, because, you know, I do agree with you, I think at the grounds level, people are not nearly as divided as the media would like them to be, or at least tries to make them be in a group with what you said about the classical liberalism. It feels like conservatives are the only ones defending true liberalism at this point. Yeah, not. You know, these basic universal principles that that is, as you said, it's not a utopia. It's not meant to be because utopia means no place. And it's a sense of humility, right? A sense of humility with what we can accomplish. It is an understanding that the best you can do for society is to, is adherence to these universal principles that have been discovered over time through a lot of hardship and through a lot of deep thinking. And that's kind of the, that's the entire point of Western civilization is the discovery of these universal principles that can be applied universally. But it does not pretend that the hearts of men have changed. You know, we still have the same brains as the ancient Romans who were cheering as people's limbs were torn off by lions in a Colosseum. The brains have not changed. But what we have implemented is structures and a series of incentives and universal principles that inhibit to the best of our ability, those worst inclinations. And when people still see those, those, I guess, injustices play out, you know, again, it's this, this despair that, that, and then they seek to erode the entire system and it's a deeply unhealthy. Well, thank you so much. I know I know we're at a time. Jan Hercio Lee, it was a fascinating conversation. Appreciate all the work, appreciate your story. It's, it's really unbelievable and appreciate what you do for America. And Dan, thank you so much for your service and your sacrifice. Thank you again for having this conversation for fighting this brand new fight. Well, now happy to do it. Great to have you. Thank you."
