    "text": " Welcome back in our number three Friday edition clay Travis Buck Sexton show Buck Sexton out sick He will be back on Monday. I told him to cover his head Sleep as much as possible and fluidate substantially If you've been listening to the show, you know, we've been talking about an absolute ton of stories new jobs with from the Biden administration 573,000 expected only 210,000 in reality All different sorts of angles here Joe Manchin has announced he's opposed to the private vaccine mandate Fauci I got an incredible clip from dr. Fauci which you guys are gonna love Alec Baldwin doing his interview with stephen novelist we talked with Monica Crowley about the failures of the Biden administration as it pertains to the economy at play we've had some fun with Brian Kelly the new LSU football coach and his awful southern accent and we bring in now The man who knows a little bit about the South. He is George's favorite son Herschel Walker Heisman trophy winner All-time legend and maybe the man who is gonna flip back control of the United States Senate to Republicans from Democrats Herschel, what's up, my man? You and Atlanta yet? I am in Atlanta. How are you doing? I'm doing fantastically well So I want to start with this question We'll get to your Bulldogs who have a chance to beat Alabama in advance to the college football playoff here in a moment But you are on the road. We've had you on a couple of times on that We did you did the Fox college football pregame show with me had you on with me with Hannity from down at the Georgia Florida game in Jacksonville How are you liking the campaign and what's it like to be running for Senate compared to the other things that you've done in your life? Well, you know, and I'm gonna be honest goes I always try to be honest with the people you know when I first started I didn't know what to expect, you know People always tell you how terrible how bad it is Ah people gonna come after you and and after I got into all my different Listening sessions and started looking talking to the people and travel on beyond is this is the best thing I've ever done in my life Because this is an opportunity I can help people and when I've had spent as much time with the military that I spent and been around a lot of our Law enforcement and just listening to the people now. I see that this country needs some help You know, there's where we're the greatest country in the world right now. We need some help We need people that's gonna be honest. We need people that care about this country Need people that care about these kids and care about law enforcement People that's gonna talk up and tell people that you know have faith and because it is sad that we are Seemed to be going away from things that that is so free to this country that we're trying to get away from it Her show it's interesting. You're good friends with Donald Trump and obviously Donald Trump is not a career politician If he hadn't run for president and gotten elected president. Do you think you would have ended up in politics? Yeah, I still probably would have because Donald Trump had nothing to do with me running You know when he talked about me running on Fox and had nothing to do whether I was gonna run or not You know, I went into prayer about it. You know, and I and I told people I was like, this is not something I thought I ever do in my life. It was something that was called upon me and as I looked at it I realized that you know what my life ain't about me. It's about helping other people You know if I can say that I love the Lord Jesus if I can tell kids to go out and sacrifice and make good grades To do what you want to do I can tell the military's Psychifying all men in blue are sacrificing and yet all I've done is throw a football around all I've done It's been on a track field or in a or in a box lead Those are great privileges that I had on the backs of people that fault to give me these freedoms. I haven't this country Well right now there's an opportunity where I can change some things I can go out and maybe be a voice to let the people know that I'm behind the American people I'm behind this country. This is not a terrible country. This is not a racist country This is not a country that people don't want to work people do want to work This is a country that we can come together that we can solve problems We've done it time and time again and just because we elected some people to Washington that doesn't doesn't seem to want to do that job That doesn't seem to want to believe in the Constitution Don't give up faith don't give up hope because I'm gonna get elected and I'm gonna tell them that you can believe in those things You can have that America's dream that I've had Hey, man Why do you think so many athletes and entertainers have gotten wrapped up in saying America is an awful place You what you and I obviously disagree and think America's the greatest country that's ever existed in the history of the world Why do you think it's become so trendy for athletes and entertainers to tear down America? Well, that is very simple look at the council culture we're in right now Right now you can't even agree to disagree right now if you speak out on something You know you're gonna get chastised people gonna come down on you You'll wonder the worst thing that happened is early on with the BLM When they are wanting to put like don't stand do stand what you're gonna do what America but a national anthem And it's like oh we're gonna do this here and you have some players on that team that didn't get a voice I can guarantee you have some of the players on a team that want to disagree but they were not gonna speak up They were not gonna speak up because they were gonna get chastised they were gonna get put down and you know And that's what I said we got to get away from that Why don't we remove this this racism out of here? We quit talking about it and move on because you know we are Americans And I'm tired of hearing this about black white African American You know if you live in an American, why don't you just be an American? You know I asked my son this the other day. I said Christian because I didn't know I was totally confused What do he put down on his sheet and he said dad I put that other And I said my son is not a other he's an American and you know what if he's an other we have a lot of others in this Country because 23 of me is just screwed us all up. You know we all have different races within us So we all are others So why don't we just get down to being an American who we are Protecting this country protecting this citizen sending our kids in school putting people biting the world getting this economy down There's a this economy this economy is blowing people out of the roof I know world can you enjoy Christmas when you can't even buy gifts? The gas prices is going up and people don't even know the reason why well the reason why is what he did with the pipeline He gave it away. There's one of the biggest reasons So everything not going up can't pay for stuff on his shelves pants and go to the grocery store Herschel you're saying a lot of things I think people agree with out there and it's fun because I've been on my bus tour all over the south meeting white black Asian and Hispanic people and at your point we all have a lot more in common than we do apart But it feels like many people in the media are trying to tear us apart every day I bet on your tour around Georgia as you've begun your campaign You found that out right how much more people in Georgia and around the country having common then they do apart I've totally totally found that out then you know what's so strange about it is Yeah, I'm a big judge judy fan and she makes a statement that is so so true She said you know you got two ears and one mouth Why don't you close your mouth and listen because we listen we can hear each other But yet we want to yell at each other and argue with each other rather than coming up with solutions They're not problems, you know if we start thinking about the easy thing We can fix first the easy things we can fix first because we can get that done Let's not try to come on to the complicated thing We can get the things done and people ask me why do I want to run for officers reason I want to run is I love America the reason I want to run and I love it. I love this. I love the Constitution You know I want to run because of that. I love this country. I live in I'm not an African American I've never been to Africa and I'm sorry to say that I'm an American I'm an American I live in America and I got an American son a guy American wife and I'm an American So let's get back to being there and solving the problems we have here and Get out of all this stuff. We can have right now going on We're talking to Herschel Walker. All right. One of the things that's going on I'm gonna hop in my car and drive down to Atlanta as soon as I'm finished with the show here today Herschel Your Bulldogs are playing against the Alabama Crimson Tide on Saturday tomorrow in the Georgia Dome big-time SEC Championship game what happens? Well, it's gonna be a great game I think Georgia is gonna win this game and the annotator reason why I don't think this team is intimidated by Alabama But I think the people need to realize Alabama is a great team Coach Saban always always put a great team out on the field and we can't look at how Alabama has played in the past You know, you saw a player against Auburn and so it was a closed game But they pulled it out was a closed game, but they won it got Alabama has got a great great program But I think Georgia right now is playing at the top of that game and there but one of the things George got to realize This is the beginning of that season right here You got to go out and beat Alabama don't worry about anything else because Alabama is a tough tough ball game But Georgia got the team to beat it. I think coach smart has done an incredible incredible job They get those guys prepared when those guys come to play you see that they're having fun I think that's one of the biggest keys you go out there You have fun because if that defense get get want to go out and have fun They're gonna play foot they're gonna play football and I think the same thing gonna happen with the offense You see the defense having fun now you want to go out and have fun and this is like playing at home You know Athens is what seven miles away from? Atlanta so it's like playing at home You're it's gonna be an incredible game whoever can buy a ticket I can sit on Television and I'm not putting in all the team down But I think you're watching the two best college football team play this coming Saturday It's been 41 years since you won a national championship with Georgia in 1980 Herschel Would you have ever believed it would be two generations before Georgia potentially would win another one when you won it back in 1980? I Wouldn't ever thought that you know, you know It they've come so close and I think this is a year that they can close the door and make that happen You know, you know, I never thought I can ever win a championship and you know I have an opportunity last night to be because do it and I'm reminding myself that he said to us at the very beginning of that Training camp he said man if we come together we go out and we stay together we fight together We can win a championship and I think I can see that what Coach Martin has this team doing is playing together That it does not one hero on that team They're all heroes and and that's where I felt that we had at Georgia and I see that in this team And one thing I said early on and people said oh geez don't say that I think this team is better I think this team is better than the team I played on I'm not putting that team I played on down I thought the team I played on was incredible But I think this team here got the potential to do some incredible things and that's showing it I don't want to feel that showing what they can do and you know I I through Jordan Davis name in the Heisman Trophy and I said guys who is not a more colorful guy playing on that Defense and Jordan Davis the guys incredible you seeing play you seeing run I tell you what and I'm not putting in a height and other hydrants candidates down But why Jordan Davis name out and not on that list Though it's well said by the way, we're having some fun on Friday I understand that your golden retriever has a Twitter handle How is he being received at cheerio Walker? How is he being received your dog so far on Twitter? He is doing well. Let me tell you what happened. He got hit at Georgia Everyone thought I was gonna come in with the bulldog. I came in with cheerio Golden retriever and he got some style. Tell you very good looking dog He's very good looking but let me tell you he's a prima Donna I gotta get him kind of tough. He's not like ugher. I gotta get him a little bit tougher Cheerios more, you know having a wife who loves animals as well. She's always dressing him up with things around his necks making That's not a cheerio there. So we got to keep cheerio looking tough I said you got to look tough in Christian absolutely loving that was his dog and he goes off to college He leave cheerio with us now He's got a Twitter got people coming over want to do pictures with him and they can put him on his Twitter account So he got a couple of followers right now Herschel tell your wife.

He'll be back on Monday But little Lord Fauci was on I believe it was MSNBC or CNN or whatever the heck it is one of the places where they never asked him difficult questions You remember how everybody said that referring to COVID as coming from China was racist remember how that argument just got started despite the fact that we've long referred to viruses by where we have them Initially a rise. That's geographically common Whether it's something simple like Ebola or whether it's Whether it's the Spanish flu which didn't actually it appears originate in Spain whether it is All these different viruses many of them are connected to the place where we initially became aware that they existed Well, we were told that was racist when Trump was referring to This as being from Wuhan or also as saying that maybe potentially it had come out of the lab in China or the China virus or whatever it was Well Listen to this dr. Fauci. Uh-oh He referred to it as the Wuhan virus. We have the cut here's little Lord Fauci if you look at the vaccination We were vaccinated against the original what we call ancestral a Wuhan strain. Oh my god Fauci he must be impeached immediately. Do you know how racist that was? We repeat that Fauci? Super racist. I've been informed of reliably that if you refer to a virus as being from China That means you are super racist. I'm gonna play this for you again. I'm about to fall down on my couch I'm grabbing my pearls. I'm fainting. Let's listen to this again. If you look at the vaccination We were vaccinated against the original what we call ancestral a Wuhan strain. Oh my god the Wuhan strain This is the most racist thing I have ever heard I don't know how immediately Fauci isn't impeached I Demand he apologized for his racism crew. Can we reach out to Fauci and demand an apology for this racist? I can't believe we even just played that as the FCC are they gonna shut us down? Are we even gonna be allowed to continue the show after that? Unbelievable racism from dr. Fauci that we just broadcast across the nation we've learned anything since 2020 nothing quite as important as a powerful immune system. Oh, what a perfect transition Right now you can get hooked up with a perfect perfect way to strengthen your immune system 55 vine ripe and fruits and vegetables plus probiotic and digestive enzymes it is Texas superfood Dr. Black designed Texas superfood to make your immune system better than anything on the market They know we know they taught us that your immune system job is detect deflect and destroy bacteria you come in contact with your grandma I told you to eat your fruits and veggies, but are you doing it right now? You need to sign up for under two dollars a day go to Texas superfood calm slash clay or call 855 Texas 55 that Texas superfood dot com slash clay or 855 Texas 55 You're listening to clay Travis and bucks X to fund the EIV network Welcome back in clay Travis bucks X to show thanks for making November the biggest month and the podcast history Also for all of you listening all over the country lots of great data out there for that as well You want to go and make sure you don't miss a single moment We just talked with Herschel Walker who is running for the Senate in the great state of Georgia. We talked with Monica Crowley We've been discussing a great deal of the biggest stories in the world having a little bit of fun with you guys as well Dr. Fauci super racist man. I don't know about you guys. I Don't know it keeps his job Been wrong about everything with COVID nobody cares Super racist about China. I I don't know he referred to COVID as coming from Wuhan, China That's racist. I've been reliably told for almost two years now That mentioning that COVID came out of China or mentioning COVID in connection with China in any way is super racist China virus can't say that Wuhan strain can't say that that's what dr. Fauci just said I Didn't know that dr. Fauci was such a super racist Did he Awfully do a job responding to COVID. Yes, we knew that But he did that and he's a super racist. I just I don't know he keeps the job. I really don't We got a lot of people out there who want to weigh in it is open line Friday and take some of your calls here in moment 800-282-282 Buck Sexton out sick not COVID at least not yet And he is going to be back on Monday, but he was on Greg Gutfeld show last night You can watch a clip of buck up at clay and buck calm. You can also see me earlier today Well last night I was on Hannity talking about the Alec Baldwin situation earlier today I was on talking about this ridiculous situation going on in the Ivy League if you guys heard about this There is a transgender swimmer That is kicking the ass of all these women out there in the Ivy League This transgender swimmer spent three years swimming as a man three years swimming as a man and then decided to become a woman and Now is dominating in the Ivy League kicking all these women's asses think about where we are right now With the woke agenda and its intersection with so much of our popular culture You have got a guy who was a good enough swimmer to swim in college in the Ivy League for three years training up early every morning good physical condition if you've seen male swimmers big broad-shouldered Strong I know this may be a little bit triggering but men as a group are Bigger stronger and faster than women. I know I know I know I know biology Some of you out there listening right now. You're like oh my god. That is so sexist of you Don't blame me blame biology. It is sexist as a group men are bigger stronger and faster than women and So male athletes being bigger faster and stronger than women produce better athletic results than women that is why we have men sports and women sports But the woke agenda has become so all-encompassing That we now have a male swimmer University of Pennsylvania for three years That decides he wants to become a woman and he now has switch teams And he is kicking the crap out of all these Ivy League women swimmers You know what a lot of these women know this is wrong It violates the very sanctity of sport itself that men would compete against men and women would compete against women all of these girls In these Ivy League schools have been waking up at 4 a.m. They've been swimming They've been training their entire lives and Suddenly there's a guy who decides to identify as a woman that is dominating all of them and Many of these women I guarantee you do not feel like they can speak out particularly in the Ivy League Because they are afraid that they might actually lose their ability to get a job To be able to compete because they will be branded as anti-trends gender I don't care what gender you want to be if you're an adult. I really don't make yourself happy But the idea that a man who spends his entire life training as a male athlete can suddenly flip and become a woman and start dominating women and we're supposed to pretend that that is okay represents a complete repudiation of the entire Goal of athletics, which is we want the best man or best woman to win We don't want the best man who used to be a man to be the best woman Ridiculous we got a bunch of people we want to weigh in it's open line Friday 800 282 282 I do not have this open in front of me But I was asking you for some of the worst movie accents. We were playing the awful Brian Kelly And Laurel in Portsmouth. She's not in a movie, but she kind of seems like she might be an actress You're talking about Kamala Harris's fake accents Yes, fake takes the cake Everything about Kamala Harris's yes, I got a question about the abortion Bill or the if it gets overturned is it still federally funded and we won't be paying any more federal taxes to plan parenthood Yeah, it's a good question on the Hyde Amendment and how exactly that would apply it would first of all the federal government would not be able to pass a law Making abortion legal nationwide because the votes aren't there. So what would happen if Roe v. Way? Thank you for the call if Roe v. Way is overturned is every state would get the ability to determine whether or not there would be legal abortions there whether the Hyde Amendment and how the Hyde Amendment would apply is a great question that I haven't really Thought about from the larger context if there's no federal right to abortion and it becomes a state related issue It doesn't seem to me like and this is just me working through the legal mechanics in my head in the in the real time It doesn't seem to me like that would apply and by the way, we have Kamala's fake accent cut 27 if you guys want a good laugh here with us in government we campaign with deep plan Upper case t uppercase t d plan and then the environment is such that we're expected to defend the plan Even when the first time we roll it out there may be some glitches and it's time to reevaluate and then do it again That is Kamala Harris with her French accent If you missed that when she was standing in the French lab and some Lee decided to have an American French accent I don't understand it at all John in Columbia, South Carolina. What you got for me? I Job solo there the bad accent theme Robert Redford to golf fantasy movie the legend of bagger Vance they filmed right here in South Carolina They cast Charlize Theron as a southern Bell and her accent was horrendous I gotta cut her some slack because the South that she's from in South Africa. That's right day Charlie's Theron is actually an African American. I mean literally an African American. She's from South Africa She now is an American. She's truly an African American bill in Maine Herschel Walker fan Bill. What do you think of the interview? We just did? Then first you'll walk is a good man, and I'm proud to share this country with a man of his honesty dignity integrity Sleeping giants waking up. We're gonna take this country back. I love you Herschel Walker God bless you brother Now that is an accent that what Brian Kelly should sound like that's a great Massachusetts accent They are calling and I think the guy was from Maine great Northeastern accent. That's what Brian Kelly should sound like I appreciate all of you can we play dr. Fauci being super racist again Do we have dr. Fauci referring to the strain of the virus coming out of Wuhan? I just I want to prepare all of you I Want to prepare all of you for this. We'll play it for you in just a sec This is super racist. All right. I am disgusted that dr. Fauci would be this racist I think based on democratic standards. He has to be removed from office. We may need to stone him I you know that's kind of the direction that everything is going when someone offends cultural Sensibilities is not enough that they be canceled and removed from office there may need to be a public stoning of dr. Fauci for this extreme racism I want I again, I'm sorry that we have to share this with you I want all of you to be comfortable and careful But you just need to know that you're about to hear something that the Democrats have told me for two years as super racist And it's coming straight from dr. Fauci if you look at the vaccination We were vaccinated against the original what we call ancestral or Wuhan strain. Oh my god That is the most racist thing that I I don't know I mean, I don't know how Fauci even looks at himself in the mirror after this interview I don't know how he does it. I he has to be removed from office. That's the democratic standard AOC. Yes She tweeted about this yet. Do we know I won't stand for this racism me and AOC we're gonna demand that dr. Fauci be fired immediately He can't continue to work When we come back we'll close out the show the pets and our lives are part of our family If you're lucky enough to have cats or a dog in your home, you know what I mean Our family has two cats and life at home would not be nearly as fun I think my wife wrote this if they weren't a part of our lives a healthy pet's a happy pet And that's what we want we welcome to sponsor to this program this summer makes healthy food supplements for dogs and man Has this audience responded to much rough greens.

We'll be at stats Wanted to as we as we roll in here again I want to apologize for the extreme racism of dr. Anthony Fauci and referring to the luhan strain I know a lot of you jaws dropping still overwhelmed by the fact that he could be that racist and that he could be in that position and And be such a card-carrying racist. I don't know. It's possible. I don't know how he's gonna keep his job AOC and I are gonna not rest until he's forced to resign Big news on the day. We started the show with this want to reinforce it with you in case you missed it The expectation was that they were gonna be 573,000 new jobs created the reality is 210,000 new jobs were actually created a massive miss on the new jobs report and There are nearly four million people out there who had jobs and were working before the COVID shutdowns happen and And it is all a it's all a big disaster if you look at what's going on the red states are recovering I read you the data right from the Wall Street Journal unemployment data red states Incredibly low blue states incredibly high and I'll hit that for you right here Just as we finish off the show because I think this is significant California has the highest unemployment rate in the country 7.3% Nevada also 7.3% the New Jersey New York all right around 7% same thing with New Mexico Connecticut Hawaii and Michigan all of those states have Democratic governors all those states and I just read you eight biggest Unemployment rates largest unemployment rates in the country all in Democratic states lowest unemployment rates not gonna surprise you all in Republican led states Republicans and the red states are getting back to normal blue states are still a drag on our economy and our country and They continue to be curled up in the fetal position with four masks on and there has matt suits instead of actually working We got a call in Louisville By the way, we are number one in our time slot in Louisville, Kentucky appreciate everybody in the state of Kentucky listening to us Fauci and his racism James wants to weigh in what you got for us Well, hello, I'd just like to point out that my legal years picked up on something that you kind of missed on Founcy statement He you know, he obviously he you know made the racist statement about the the Wuhan strain But he said we Refer to it as the move on straight. Who is we at the NIH and the CDC? Oh my god They might all have to be fired for being racist. Can we play that clip one more time? That's a great discovery by James Fauci just threw the entire NIH and the CDC under this is what systemic racism is They are systemically racist at the NIH and the CDC for referring to a virus that came from China I've been reliably told that's a racist for referring to a virus that came from John from China as the as the Wuhan strain Let's listen to this one more time again If you got kids in the car you may want to cover their ears don't expose them to racism too early But if you look at the vaccination we were vaccinated against the original what we call ancestral or Wuhan strain We we maybe everybody maybe Fauci is trying to speak for everybody out there Good call hail that great call James is Louisville hail down in Texas Worst accents in and we had a lot of you waiting in so much on social media appreciate all that He's got one for us too as we finish off the show.
