    "text": " Everyone knows the adage, it's not what you know, it's who you know, and is overly simplistic as it may be. There's a lot of truth to that for a lot of different reasons. Today I'm joined by Ken Coleman. He's the author of Proximity Principle and he's here to talk with us about how true that statement is and to break it down for us even further. We talk about finding the right people and being in the right places, overcoming the limited beliefs fueled by our pride and fear, building an expansive web of the right connections and how to utilize the Proximity Principle to get ahead. You're a man of action. You live life to the fullest. You embrace your fears and boldly charge your own path. When life knocks you down, you get back up one more time, every time. You are not easily deterred or defeated, rugged, resilient, strong. This is your life. This is who you are. This is who you will become at the end of the day and after all is said and done, you can call yourself a man. Gentlemen, what is going on today? My name is Ryan Miffler and I am the host and the founder of this podcast, The Order of Man, One Stop Shop, the premier source of information for helping you and me and every man listening to this podcast step more fully into the role of husband, father and business owner and community leader and coach and mentor and brother. Every facet of your life. It's my goal to give you the tools and the conversations and the resources and the information that you need to step more fully into those roles and live the life that you're capable of living, living that life that you're meant to live. And I couldn't be more honored that you're on this path with us. We've got our interview show, which is what you're listening to right now. We've got Ken Coleman on today, but we've had some other incredible, incredible guests, guys like Jocko Willing, David Goggins, Andy Fersilla, Grant Cardone, Tim Kennedy, as I tell you every week, the list of the men that we've had on the lineup is just, it's absolutely incredible. And it's a testament to the fact that high achieving, highly ambitious, highly motivated and successful men want to be part of the order, want to be part of this movement to reclaim and restore masculinity. And if you aren't already subscribed guys, make sure you subscribe because you've got this show, your interview show, you've got the Wednesday show tomorrow show, which is an ask me anything with my co host, Kip Sorenzen. And then you've got our Friday show, which is Friday Field Notes, where you get to hear me and some of my thoughts from throughout the week. So make sure you subscribe, make sure you leave a rating and review. I don't ask a whole lot, but that rating and review goes such a long way in promoting the visibility and of course the work, the instrumental work in society of restoring men to their proper place. Anyways, guys, like I said, glad you're here. Just a quick announcement before I get into the conversation with Ken, I want to mention my friends and show sponsors, Origin, Maine, I'm actually looking forward to it because in the next two weeks, I'm going to be about 10 minutes from Origins Factory. A lot of you guys know that I am moving to Maine. And you've had questions about why that is. And I got into that a couple of weeks going to Friday Field Notes. You can go listen to that. But I am excited to be close to these guys because of what they're doing, what they stand for, how they operate and ultimately being able to learn from them because they're doing things right. Everything that they do from their geese and their rash guards and their lifestyle apparel, they've got a brand new denim line. I think their boot line is coming on board here soon. And then of course they've got their supplemental lineup partnered up with Jocko. It's the joint warfare, the super-krill, the discipline, the mulk, all of that stuff, 100% made in America. And I'm telling you what, I use those supplements and I've noticed a huge, huge advantage. I'll say this, if you're not doing everything else, like eating right and exercising and doing jujitsu, the things that we've talked about doing, those probably aren't going to make as big a difference. But if you're doing those things, they're going to magnify those things even further. So if you're interested in checking out what they have to offer, head to originmain.com and use the code order, or DER at checkout. Originmain.com, use the code order at checkout. And we're probably going to be doing a meetup in July. Looks like the end of July. I'll get you some more details as this comes on board. But we're probably going to be partnered up with Origin on that as well. And you'll be able to see our new place. And you'll also be able to check out Origin's headquarters. So it's going to be good. I'll let you know the details on that. But you got to subscribe to the show to get that information. All right, guys, that's all I've got for you by way of announcements. Let's get into this. As I said earlier, my guest today is Ken Coleman. Now, I will admit that I hadn't been familiar with his work until Ramsey Solutions reached out to me about his new book, Proximity Principle. But after doing some research and learning more about him, I truly understand how well this guy knows his stuff, how powerful of a resource he can be for any man who's trying to get ahead in his career and build something meaningful and significant in his life. Ken is an author. He's a career expert. Of course, he's a member of Ramsey Solutions, where he frequently co-hosts the Dave Ramsey Show. I really enjoy this conversation, guys. And I have no doubt that you will do. But more importantly, I know that you'll get a ton out of it. Ken, thanks for joining me on the show today. I'm honored to have you on. Ryan, I'm thrilled to be with you. Yeah, I read the book, Proximity Principle. And I'm not sure if we've ever had a conversation like this, but career aspirations and getting guys to move forward and figure out, they're calling and help them discover what they're created to do, which is your line of work is critical. And I think it's something a lot of guys are missing in their lives. Yeah, I absolutely know that to be true. We know this about men in general. So dudes, let's just be honest with each other today. We take an enormous amount of our personal identity from our work. It's just a fact, more so than women. We just know that sociology data is out there, psychology data. And so when you're not doing something that you feel a deep connection to, it is going to affect you as a man and in the roles of husband and in the roles of father and friend and teammate, it's really, really important that we have men that are on purpose. I agree with that. Why do you think there is such a difficulty in men finding something they're deeply connected with? I've seen statistics that say as high as 70% of people out there are dissatisfied with their job. So this is not uncommon. No, not at all. I think what happens is there is tremendous pressure, good pressure, but anything good can have negative effects. And there is this pressure of providing. That's just part of who we are as men. I make no bones about this. I believe God put that in us and still that in us that we are providers. And so you take that intrinsic need to provide because there's a responsibility to provide. So we feel that need to be a good provider. And I think what happens is somewhere along the way, we go, all right, I've got to find a solid way, a safe way, a smart way of providing. And that is a real temptation. And so I want to be as practical as I can when I unpack this. If you don't have someone help you with what I was helped with and what I'm going to share in the course of our conversation and what the book itself does, if you don't have someone help you discover who you really are, then Ryan, you're going to default to the safe, smart decision. I'm going to go to a college. And because that's what everybody else tells me I should do, I'm going to get a degree so I can get hired. And then I'm just going to get a degree that's general, that's safe, that allow me to get a safe job. And I'm going to go get that job so that I can provide. And then you wake up somewhere between five, 10, 15, 20 years later, and you go, I'm just trying to make it through to the weekend. So I can get out of my boat, or I can go hunt, or I can go fish, or I can go play golf, or whatever it is. And we end up medicating. And it just turns into this ugly spiral. And eventually they call my show and they're going, Ken, I'm stuck. And I dive deep into, well, what does this you really love to do? Well, I really love to do this. But I just kind of fell into my current job. And this idea of falling into my job is really not falling. We are choosing to do the safe thing. And that's why so many men don't have any connection to their work. And we don't have connection to your work. Now, this is where it gets really scary, Ryan. When you don't feel like your work, your job, your career means anything to you, eventually you start to believe that you and your work don't matter to anyone else. And that's when Sunday nights get scary. Sunday nights are the number one day of the week when it comes to suicides. And that is not true. That's absolutely true. Wow, I didn't know that. Well, think about it. I mean, it makes sense. Just just intuitively. Yeah, you got to go into work the next day and face hopelessness for another week. Can't do it anymore. Yeah, that's interesting. You know, it's funny when you talk about it, not funny, but interesting you talk about this safe and smart route. I mean, I'd argue that maybe it's not all that safe and quite honestly, not all that smart, especially as we continue to be able to grow businesses and the barrier to entry does to starting a business or following a passion is more viable than it's ever been. I think maybe the safer route and the smarter, more intelligent route is to go out and to pursue with some of this passion. But my question is, is there a balance between provision and passion, right? Because I know there's been situations in my life where maybe I wasn't in the situation or in the right set of circumstances that I could dive fully into my passion and frankly did have to pay the mortgage and did have to provide for my young children and my wife. Yeah. How do you strike that balance and then ultimately know, okay, it's time to make a move here. Absolutely. Incredible question. Glad you asked it. There is no balance. There are going to be times where passion takes a back seat to provision. It's just a reality. So my own personal journey, nine years from the time I started, I told my wife I thought it'd be five to seven years to switch careers and move into broadcasting and get to a point where I could take care of the family. So I said early on five to seven years, didn't it be at nine years before I landed the true broadcasting dream job where I'm at today. And so there are times where we have to put provision ahead of passion, but that does not mean that passion has to stop. I like to use the word day job versus dream job, right? So, you know, there are times where the day job I've got to do what I have to do in order to do what I want to do. That's a great line for the movie, The Great Dabaters. Forrest Whitaker plays the father of his son, you know, and he's getting on him and all the kid wants to do is go practice debate and he's like, no, no, no, you don't do debate until homework is done and studying is done. And he says to his son, you do what you have to do, so you do what you want to do. So to your question, I don't think there's balance. I think that it is a both and and there are going to be times where the passion, quite frankly, is out of balance. There's not 50 50. It's it's 70 30 80 20 90 10. In fact, in the early days, for me chasing broadcasting, right? It was 95 five. It was 95% running my little small business so that I could take care of the three babies and mama. I mean, it's just what you have to do in those cases. Absolutely. But here's the here's the thing. As you continue to pursue significance and purpose, the percentage is change. And so it goes from 95 five to 80 20 70 30 60 40. But that takes time. But I think that a lot of guys feel like it's impossible to do both. And I'm here to tell you, I am. I am nothing other than just a walking, breathing example of how focused intensity and patience with a lot of perseverance can actually get you there. It is not a microwave situation. You're never going to hear me talk on my show or in any book, I write, give you this get rich quick or get there overnight short circuit the system. I'd be very wary of guys and gals that are writing books and giving that kind of content because that's a bunch of garbage. Yeah, it just doesn't work out like that. Well, my experience, anyways, I mean, you talk about this focus and patience, but ultimately, too, and this is a big factor of your book is that you've got to have a plan, right? A lot of these guys are like, oh, I'm miserable. I want to switch jobs. And they think that, oh, I just have to burn the bridges and burn the boats and go all in. It's like, mmm, probably ought to think about a plan, a prudent strategy to being able to put you in this position where you're able to turn something that you're passionate about into something that's going to be extremely lucrative and financially rewarding for you. That's exactly right. And one other thing, this is key for us from the emotional standpoint. Dudes don't like to talk about emotions, but we're idiots if we don't recognize the emotion that's involved in a journey like this of switching gears and changing paths to do work you love. As I was 95 five, at first, I was just feeling like it's taken too long. Am I an idiot? Am I delusional? But I stayed with it. And then when it got to 90, 10, and 80, 20, I realized something. I began to take the day job and I began to really appreciate it and my station because I felt better about myself because I was still providing. Remember, that's core to who we are as men, but I was also pursuing the passion while still doing a good job providing. And it allowed me to be more patient. It gave me more juice to persevere because I was doing a good job of providing. And I saw some gains in the area of passion. And so I think if you can get that guys and you go, okay, it's going to take some time. I'm going to have to be patient persevere. But just a little bit of the passion will give us enough juice to keep going. And you can't underestimate this idea of, hey, I'm still providing and I'm making moves to get where I want to go. And here's the thing. I'd like to see the numbers change dramatically, Ryan, but the reality is that's not going to happen overnight. So I want guys to hear that if you do this, this mindset, this, okay, I'm going to be thankful for where I am grateful for the opportunity of the stage job. I'm going to do a little bit as I can as life allows, money allows, schedule allows. You're going to be ahead of everybody else. You're going to feel like you're just crawling. But most guys never do what we're talking about. They take the first step. So even if you're five steps in, brother, you are ahead of the pack. And that's what I want guys to hear. No, I'm glad you bring this up because this is actually one of the things I wrote here and jotted down as a note is how you manage the nine years, right? Because when you're looking back, or when somebody's looking at you, it might, they might think, well, that's easy for you to say, right? But my situation is different. I'm in it. I'm in the trenches. I'm, I'm dealing with this right now. And so I think it is really critical that you as in a position you want to be me in a position I want to be talk about how we manage this when we were in the day to day grind where these guys are currently struggling. I can see them right now driving down the road and they're two hour commute to an office in a cubicle they hate. Now it's a lot harder when you're in it, of course, it's a lot more difficult when you're in it than when you're on the other side of things looking back. Yeah, let's just address some of the emotions. So some of you guys are feeling massive amounts of doubt. I mean, bone crushing doubt. It sounds like this. Have I lost my mind? Please tell me I'm not delusional and all my friends and all my family and even my wife are rolling their eyes or laughing about me. My wife's scared because she feels like I'm leading her into financial destruction. You know, all these things, and then there's fear. Oh my gosh, I don't, if I keep doing this, I feel like my day job is going to get taken away or I'm going to fail on my business or if I, if I get to a point where I actually have to step out and even though I've got a plan, if I step out, I'm going to ruin my financial situation and set my family back 10 years. These are real emotions, fear and doubt, fear of rejection. Some of you aren't even taking the first step because you're afraid to get rejected. So you know, listen, two years into me saying, all right, this is what I believe I'm supposed to do. I'm sitting out on my back porch, I write about in the book, Ryan, you read it. That really happened. I was just miserable and nothing but negativity racing through my mind sitting out on my back porch because I hadn't been discovered yet and I've been rejected a few times and the sting of rejection paralyzed me for about two years because I didn't want to feel that anymore. And so I was looking for the break, basically want somebody to notice me and, you know, give me, you know, some type of golden ticket, open the door and inquire behind the door. And here's my dreams. This is what I was wanting emotionally. Now, as silly as that sounds, that took me to get to that place going, nobody is sitting around thinking about how they can help King Coleman. I mean, how stinking arrogant do you have to be? And the reason I was arrogant is because I was so self-consumed with, you know, I deserve better than this. And I was actually building a fence around myself, one plank at a time, doubt, fear, insecurity, rejection, you know, privilege, pride. Didn't want to ask for help. So guys, if you're feeling that weight, you know, understand you're not alone, I've been there. And the way out of that is those are all lies. So the antidote to lies is truth. So if the lie says you're delusional, you actually don't have the talent to do this, you're going to fail, you're going to embarrass your wife, whatever. If that's the lie, then you got to have an opposite. Okay, thought that is based in truth. I do have what it takes. I'm still learning. I'm experiencing momentum here and here. I got to stay with it. And if I stay with it, another opportunity is going to come along. That's why I wrote the proximity principle is I want guys to realize is it hard work? Yes, is the journey along? Yes. But the path is not difficult. All right. The actual path itself is this is very, very doable. It's just chopping down trees going, I need to be around this kind of person, the person that I write about the book, there's five people and there's five places. I need to be around these people and in these places. And when I do that, opportunity will come. It's guaranteed. Thinking strategically, identifying people in places and then putting myself there, swallowing my pride, getting over my fear, overcoming doubt. And what happens is proximity begins to create momentum and more positive thoughts. And so we go, all right, that's a lie because I've actually made some momentum here. And if I stay with it, it's going to happen. So long winded answer there. But I want guys that are experiencing those emotions to number one, don't feel bad about feeling those emotions. That's real. And you have got to really be okay saying, that's silly. And know that those thoughts are going to continue to come. Can I just tell you something, Ryan? I have some insecurity about this book launch. Why? Because I work for Dave Ramsey, guys of Hall of Famer and a legend. Guys sells more books between two and three AM than I've sold in my life. While he sleeps. You know, my point is, is that silly? Yes. And you laughed at it, right? But I'm insecure about that, right? What am I doing? I shouldn't be measuring myself against Dave Ramsey, right? I'm not Dave Ramsey. My goal is not Dave Ramsey's goals. You know, so then I have to retreat from all that stuff and go, Hey, it's all about helping one person at a time, one caller on the show at a time, one reader at a time, giving them the truth that they were created to do something unique. It is needed and they must do it and they can get there. That's a great point. And you actually drill down into that pretty well in the book when you talk about one bold step at a time. I think what we as men get ourselves into is having these big audacious goals because we're told that's what we should have, right? And I think there's merit and validity to that. But then we get so consumed and so overwhelmed. And I think a lot of the times what guys are dealing with, I know I certainly was, and this is a big part of the reason the book resonated so well with me, is because you sitting on the porch was me pacing around my backyard, wondering how I was going to pay the mortgage, wondering how I was going to put food on the table, wondering how I was going to make a a budding financial practice actually work. I mean, that's a real struggle for me. But just learning to, yes, have that big target, but then work backwards into the what is the one thing that you can do right now, right now to move the needle. And then after that, what's the next one thing and the next one thing and the next one thing? And before long, you start to see how far you've actually come. That's right. Well, so let's think about Mount Everest for a moment. You know, in the book, Ryan, we use that analogy throughout because I think it's the easiest way to paint a picture for what every person is going to face as they seek to pursue their purpose. Okay, I see the top of Mount Everest. I see it in pictures. I can even take a visit there and I can somewhere look up and see the top of it. Wow, majestic. That's where I want to go. That's the dream job broadcast. I want to have a national radio show television, do all this stuff, write books, blah, blah, blah, blah. Okay, I see that. That's really fun. In the middle of the sudden, your eyes have got to drop down at some point. And just for fun here, let's just go there. So let's just say that we could be transported to the base of Mount Everest. We're there. We can see up. It's majestic. We're taking pictures. And then we look down and we go, okay, let's say we got to climb this today. That would be insanity. You would never do that. What would you do? Well, the first thing you do is you go talk to somebody who knows what it takes to actually climb the mountain. You think you'd do that. That'd probably be the best approach. Right. But like you said, so many guys, we see the mountaintop and we go, Geronimo, here we go. We wonder why we fail or we wonder why terrified when we actually get on the mountain. So just think about how terrifying that would be. So what do we got to do? Well, firstly, we got to find out what it's going to take. And we're going to talk to people who climb that mountain before, right? And then we're going to go, okay, there's multiple different people and places that I'm going to have to put myself into actually have a chance at climbing this mountain. I'm going to have to get in shape. What does it take to physically scale the mountain? Now, this is this is training conditioning. So I've got to go get ready there. What is the mental aspect? Okay. And the mental aspect is I'm going to have to put myself in some hardship, because here's what I know. Once I begin to climb that mountain, weather's going to happen. Nature's going to happen, right? Maybe the path we thought was there is now closed. You talk about a storm coming in, storms of life, where you might have to spend two, three days on the side of a mountain hunkered down. Now, you don't make it any progress in those two to three days. But guess what? The storm passes. You stayed, you hunkered, and now we keep progressing. See, I tell people all the time, Ryan, that many times just hanging in there one week where you look back and go, I didn't accomplish anything this week. And I go, did you hang in there? Right. You're still in the game, right? Still in the game, which is your head of everybody else to quit this week. So that mountain analogy is about, you know, okay, who are the people and the places I need to get around in order to be trained and equipped. And then I got to hire a guide, right? A guide to leave me at the mountain. And then here's my favorite part, is you know, one of the people in the book is peers. I'm climbing that mountain. We're all attached together on a rope. I'm not climbing that mountain alone. And so it's really important that we don't, that we don't try to do it alone, because if we do, what's going to happen is we look at that mountain top and we see that. And then all of a sudden, as we drop our eyes, we really can't even see the middle part or even the base, right? It's covered up by clouds and it's scary. Now all of a sudden, what was majestic and a great iPhone picture becomes terrifying, terrified of the unknown. And that's what I'm trying to help people with is to understand we can help you identify who you are, what you were created to do, and come up with a plan to get there. So that knowledge kills fear. But the thing that we humans are the most afraid of is the unknown. We're not afraid of risk. We're afraid of the unknown. Big difference. Yeah, I want to get into this specifically, you know, tactically, how do we begin to climb that mountain? But before, I think it's really important, because I know a lot of guys are wondering, okay, how do I identify the mountain that I want to that I want to climb? You know, they're so ingrained and in the trenches right now with where they are, and they know they want out, but they don't know what the alternative is. They don't know where to climb to. So we can talk a little bit about how we begin to discover what it is that we're supposed to be doing, and then we'll work backwards into now, how do we do it? That's right. Love this. Well, the way to answer the question, why am I on this planet? What why am I here? What am I supposed to do with my life? Is the discovery process, and there's two key questions you have to answer in discovery. What am I most talented at? Simply put, what do I do? Better than anything else that I do. All the things I do, these are the things I do best. So these are talents, and everybody has talent. Everybody's born with talent. For the guys that are dealing with a little doubt, at some point in your life, if you look back, you will remember there were subjects in school that you were naturally good at if you saw another kid struggling, you'd say, well, that's kind of weird. It comes easy to me. You know, as you've gotten older, people compliment you. You're a great listener. You're a really good communicator. Hey, you're really good with your hands. You just come in, fix anything, whatever it is. What are we naturally good at? That's what we do best. And so you want to list out what you believe are your top talents, strengths, or skills. What are they? Literally get out a piece of paper, guys, and write talents, strength skills. I don't care what you call them, but it's a combination of all three of those things. And then underline it, and then go down and list them out. I don't care if it's seven or five or three. What do you do best? Then you go to the other side of the paper and you write passions, the underlying passions. And now on this list, I want you to write down the work, the results, the functions, the roles that bring you joy. So you say, oh, well, I love solving problems when I'm when I'm when I'm tinkering around on Saturday mornings on my car, four hours goes, and I thought it was 40 minutes. This is what we're looking for work roles, functions, tasks that bring me joy. When I'm in the middle of them, it gives me juice. I love it. I look forward to it. I don't want to quit. I can lose track of time. So list those out. Now, we've got two lists. And I think it's really important at this step that you get with somebody who really knows you well, but who is also a truth teller. They're not going to just tell you what you want to hear, not the friend who's the yes man who always makes you feel like a million dollars. I want someone who cares about you enough to tell you the brutal truth. And here's what you want to do. You want to show them the list. Hey, this is why I wrote down. This is my top talent, top passions. Do you agree? Is this how you see me? We want to make sure that we are self aware that we know how the world sees us. Now, this is a this is an okay process because even if it's if there's something you left off, or maybe you're you're giving yourself a higher grade on something that you're not, you're going to get that confirmation and a loving environment. And so now when you get feedback from people who know you well and who are honest, you have confidence. I've got clarity of the list, and they've confirmed the list. And now I have confidence. So now we kind of we're starting to fight that insecurity. We're going, okay, this is this is I know to be true. Now it gets back to you. You get back on that same piece of paper or another piece of paper, and you begin to spend time every day. It gets clearer and clear. But I want you to try to write out a purpose sentence. And the way you do that is you say, how can I use what I do best to do what I love to do most? You got the list right there. This is what I do on the phone with callers every day. And when they get it out, I can see things clearly because I'm objective. And so I'm listening to them. And so I asked them all these questions and they get to the point where they go, well, I see that. I say, well, what would you really love to do? Now that you know what you do best and you've clarified it and what you love to do most, how can you use what you do best talent to do what you love to do most passion? And so they see that and they go, well, you know, I'm great at problem solving. And I'm really creative, but I'm also really good with my hands. So I go, yeah, and you also said that your top passions where you love fixing stuff, you love carpentry, you know, and I've had guys who, you know, were in accounting, realize that what they want to do is become a carpenter. They want to do house renovations. Ken, if I could do that all day, every day, I would just absolutely lose my mind. I could work on my own pace, you know, and I'm building stuff, fixing stuff, making it better. And you got to be creative to do that kind of thing. And so anyway, the point is, is whatever it comes out to for you all, as you do this, you're going to have tremendous breakthrough because the brain, when it begins to focus on this kind of thing, it will reveal out dealing with truth. And you're seeing a formula. And so a purpose sentence goes like this, I'm going to use my top talents of blank, blank and blank, whatever it is, to do blank work that brings me great joy. The results of that work matter deeply to me. This is not difficult, Ryan. It really isn't, but it just takes discovery and honesty. I'm trying to think where somebody might get hung up in this process because it is a simple process. And two things come to mind as I think about this. Number one, I can hear somebody having a whole lot of uncertainty about, let's say they develop something, they come up with something, Hey, I want to, I want to remodel homes, I want to build houses, I want to be a professional hunter, whatever that thing is. Now there's going to be a lot of uncertainty about, Hey, I don't know how to do this. I don't know if this is right. And the second consideration I would think is that somebody might get into the trap of believing or thinking, what if this is wrong? Am I pigeonholing myself by traveling or at least exploring this path? Do you run into that or is there other things that guys are dealing with? Yeah, you nailed two of the biggest issues right there. So that's why I have a call in radio show because people, they want to have the objectivity and they want to make sure that they are in fact not delusional. So again, once you begin to fill that out, you have to have confidence that I've talked to people that know me well, I'm not delusional. I know for a fact to have these talents and I know for a fact to have these passions, what really starts to happen now is, can I actually pull this off? I don't know how to start or I don't know how to get there. That's where the proximity principle comes in. So let's go to those two, those two things that could be answered with one solution. I need to now go sit around some guys, take them to coffee, have lunch with them. You know, I want to be around people that are doing what I want to do. That's what the proximity principle is. In order to do what I want to do, fill in the blank guys, I need to be around other guys or gals that are doing it. And then I need to be in places where this craft is happening. So this could be a training school, an apprenticeship, it could be online webinars, it could be like, I need to just get in here. Why? And this answers your question. Here's why, because any doubt or fear that you have will be relieved with information. But see, when you first fill out that purpose sentence, your leer left alone, you go, Oh boy, can I actually do this? How do I pull this off? Well, how did Ken Coleman, who did have who had no broadcasting degree and no broadcasting connections? How did I get where I'm at by practicing the proximity principle? So I found guys that were in broadcast. I went took a broadcasting class with a bunch of 20 year olds. I was 33 years old, three weeks in before the guys knew I wasn't an instructor. Stop calling me. So I remember eating that. So, you know, that really happened. And I had to start from scratch. But here's what happened. I got less and less fearful and less and less doubtful. And then here's the other thing, it's not just getting information. So it's a two part answer. I want you to get around people that are doing it in places to get information. What is the possible path look like? How much time is it going to take me? How much is it going to cost? These are all things guys that when you get these answers, it's not so scary. Oh, okay. Well, how long would it take me to save up? And can I do that with my current life schedule? How long is it going to take me? All of a sudden we're not so scared. Now that's just information. That's what proximity does. It gives me information. Now, the other thing that proximity does is it allows me to test and confirm. So for instance, let's just make up an imaginary guy. And let's just say that he loves working with cars. Okay. And so we know he's creative. He's got some problems solving skills. He's good with technology. What he loves more than anything is tinkering with cars, messes around with his engine and likes of this. And so we get into that. But we also know that he loves doing body work and he loves, loves restored cars. So now is this guy going to work as a mechanic or is he going to be an auto body? Is he going to be that kind of guy? So I want him to go sit down with people in both of those spaces, mechanics, auto body. And I want him to sit on talking, but I also want him to actually volunteer his time if he has to or work on the weekend for a local auto body shop and go in and start doing some fabricating or just say, Hey, can I follow you around for two hours? And most of the time people are going to go, Sure. Right. They want to share their stuff with their passionate and excited about. They love it. So here's what happens when you begin to test and just put yourself out there at a very low risk situation, in fact, no risk. Okay, you're going to get confirmation that it is what you want to do or confirmation that it isn't what you want to do. So we don't have to quit our jobs. We don't have to sell the house. We don't have to move the kids to Missouri. Right. We get to actually wade into this a little bit and get in proximity. And that's what I mean by around the right people and in the right places. And then we're going to get confirmation. So I started hanging out with some broadcasting buddies and all it did for me, Ryan was like, it was like super juice. I was like, yeah, I would love this. And it confirmed for me that I wasn't delusional. And my heart revealed the answer. See, your question was spot on. But guys, what Ryan is addressing here is our brains. When our brains get involved, we started thinking of all the reasons why we shouldn't do it, why we can't do it, the hurdles, the financial hurdles, the schedule hurdles. That's natural. But you got to allow your brain to listen to your heart first. And once the heart confirms this is in fact, what you should be doing, then your heart's going to tell your brain, hey, brain, figure out a way to do it. Yeah, you got to have both, right? I think sometimes we're allowed to believe that it's just passion. And look, that that's not a prudent strategy. I mean, you might be excited and hopped up about it. But unless you have some thought about it, it may not be a prudent way to approach this thing. And vice versa. That's right. Yeah, you got to use your head and your heart. But let's use the head for what we were given it for. And that is to think, to plan, to strategize, let's not let the brain overrule the heart. And vice versa, you know, don't just use your heart because you're going to just make some really dumb moves. But the heart is about confirmation, the brain's about execution. Jen's time out real quick on the conversation. I want to talk with you about a concept called the wild man from the story Iron John and Robert Blis book Iron John. The wild man is the man inside that we've either silenced or even worse, maybe allowed society to silence for far too long. And it's the part of us that we need to learn to let out of the cage more often. He's our competitive, aggressive, dominant, and wild nature. And in the right circumstances and context can be used as a powerful force for growth and expansion in our lives. But most of us have allowed ourselves to be domesticated for far too long and have shut down the very elements that might just give us a competitive advantage wherever we may be showing up. And that's why we're talking about this wild man inside of our exclusive brotherhood. It's called the Iron Council. We're discovering how to acknowledge and explore and unlock him within ourselves and tap into the masculine roots that we've bound and chained and shackled and at the systematic conditioning of society. And on top of the discussions, we're discovering how to acknowledge, explore, and unlock him within ourselves and tap back into the masculine roots that we've bound and chained and shackled at the systematic conditioning of society. And on top of those discussions, we're challenging ourselves 500 men to push harder and further than we have potentially for years with the goal of accomplishing huge things in our lives. So if you want to join the discussion and you want to be part of the challenges and you want to have that level of accountability and camaraderie and brotherhood that's going to take you to the next level, then band with us at order of man.com slash iron council. Again, order of man.com slash iron council. You guys can do that after the show and learn more about the wild man and be pushed in new ways. But for now, let's get back to my conversation with Ken. I mean, I really like this, this proximity principle. And I think most people, if not all of them who are successful have used this, maybe not have articulated it. But I'm trying to think about, my own personal situation. When I was a financial advisor, and I really wanted to start a podcast because it sounded intriguing to me, you know, kind of like what you're talking about here, I went to a financial blogging conference and got around financial bloggers who were, they were podcasting, they were blogging, they were using digital media to get their information out. And it just resonated with me. So I did it. And then I decided to start a separate podcast, which is the one the guys are listening to right now, Order of Man. And I joined a mastermind of other podcasters. And because I got around them, they gave me insights and ideas and strategies I hadn't considered before. And I saw what they were doing. And I only got more excited about it and more excited about it. And switched from like you were talking about earlier, that 95 five to 80 20 to 70 30 and so on and so forth. And now here we are 100% in the opposite direction than when I was even just a year ago. Right. Let me interview you for a second. Because I think it's important your audience knows you and trust you. Tell me the range of emotions. Walk walk us through for a second when you first went through that financial blogger conference and then you got in the mastermind. What were your emotions like the thoughts? What were they before you connected and then after you connected? Well, before I connected, I felt like something was missing. I felt like, you know, I had, I had some purpose attached to what I was doing. I felt like the work I was doing with regards to financial planning was noble work. But I felt like there's just something more. And then I was, I don't know, destined or called for something more and yet wasn't stepping into that. A lot of uncertainty about going to the event. Why am I wasting my time and money here? And this is this is stupid. I shouldn't be doing this. I could be at home working on my business or being with my family. So there was a lot of that. But during the conference itself, I was really edified and uplifted about the decisions I was making and realizing that, you know, I might actually be on the right path here. And I felt really, really good about that. Got some insights and man, just decided to launch the podcast. And frankly, I haven't looked back since. There's still uncertainty on certain days, but never so much uncertainty that I don't think I'm on the right path. It's never been like that for the past four years. So you go from having a lot of doubt, some of the doubt still there, but the excitement outweighs the doubt. That's what you went through. Yeah, 100%. Absolutely. I just want people to hear that from you. There's no magical formula here. The proximity principle is not this pie in the sky, feel good chant. It's just straight up, I'm going to get there and get around those people and you walked away and made some huge decisions. And you weren't as scared, I'm guessing either because you had some ideas and some real strategies that you could put in place. Well, I think the way I would describe it is that I was still scared, but I was equipping myself with the knowledge information tactical strategy to overcome the fear that existed. There you go. You weren't paralyzed. Sure. Yeah, I think that's probably a better way to say it. Yeah, I think that's right. Yeah, fear never disappears. Let me be clear. It never disappears. But there are times where purpose and exhilaration and passion completely outweigh fear, to where fear does disappear pretty quickly. And that doesn't mean it leaves you, but it can dissipate. Well, and that's what I've noticed even now is that when I do have levels of doubt and insecurity that creep in and pop up, I'm able to silence those relatively quickly and a lot quicker than I used to be able to do because I do have the information. I do have the proximity. I do know people. I'm well connected. I'm putting myself in the right places. So let's talk about that because we've talked about, okay, I've got this idea where I think I want to pursue. Now I need to start this proximity principle. So if you would, one thing I really liked about this segment is you actually broke it down into five categories of people that we should be looking for. This is very tactical. It's very tangible. It's easy for people to recognize and see. So break down those categories for us, if you would. Sure. Well, you've got five people, the professors, the professionals, the producers, the peers, and the mentors. And I won't try to unpack all of that for you folks right now. You can dive into it. But let's look at professors. So these are people that don't necessarily have to be in a educational, traditional educational environment, meaning are they an actual professor of a class at a college that can be certainly. But it's really what I'm trying to describe in this archetype for people is somebody who has the knowledge of what you need to know and how you need to do it. What you need to know, and then how we use that knowledge. And so this is really important. So again, I'll tie it back to my journey. I didn't know anything about broadcasting. And thought I was heading into politics and was planning that and preparing for that. And realized that it was broadcasting. And so I was like, well, I don't know anything about broadcasting from a technical standpoint. And so I took a broadcasting school. And I knew that this was this guy was a local television producer. And yet in this role, he was teaching me, he was the actual professor. And so what do I need to know? That this is a big question early on. What do I need to know? What knowledge do I need? What skills do I need? How do I get those skills? How do I use the skills? You're looking for somebody who has the heart of the teacher and actually the expertise and the ability to teach and they want to teach you. And so that's a warm person. You find the right professor. It is a game changer. A lot of them in them early on in the journey can be well before we move on to the next one. And I think this is going to tie a nice seat to all of them. I think one of the concerns men have as they're looking for people to potentially learn from is that they don't have anything of value to add to the other individual. So rather than trying to find something valuable to offer or have it be a reciprocal relationship, they disengage altogether. Yeah, I think you're right. This is pride. You're absolutely spot on here on pride. So let me try to blow that up. The professor, you mean just a moment ago, I said this is also somebody who likes to teach and wants to instruct. So Jeff Patton, he didn't look at me when I showed up for my pre-class interview and say, you're not 20. He didn't discourage me and say, what are you doing here? It's a little too late in life for you, Bob. She'll go back to doing what you're doing. Jeff was like, hey, man, I'm honored that you'll be willing to take this class. I think you got a long journey ahead of you. Obviously, you're starting later the most. But I feel very confident that not only am I going to teach you the basics, I'm going to be able to connect you some key people and get you some great experience. Jeff wanted to teach. And so I didn't need to offer Jeff anything. Now, in this particular situation, I paid Jeff. So you know what the value is? I paid him. Right. Monetary exchange, sure. Yeah. So guys, get over yourself. You don't have to go in offering a bunch of things. You can say, hey, here's the deal. I need to learn this. Are you willing to teach me? So who's teaching your craft? This is not that difficult. Now, what you're talking about, this value proposition, that is something that you're going to feel more when you're when you're reaching out for a mentor. Again, I'll just jump ahead to that same thing. The mentor gets value out of mentoring you. Anybody who's ever mentored, or quite frankly, anybody's ever taught, if you've ever taught a class in church, if you've ever spoken on a stage and taught a lesson, you always get more out of it than the audience does. So I'm glad you brought that up because you don't need to walk in with a value proposition. You need to walk in with a spirit of humility and a spirit of gratitude. That is value enough because a true professor and a true mentor is going to say, I love it. I'm happy to share with you what I know. And I would also add too, in the spirit of humility, like you mentioned, is one of the best things you can do is to just implement the advice of your mentor. For example, if you come to a mentor and you ask for advice and you ask for specifics and getting to a field or a practice or whatever it may be, and they give that to you, and then you don't implement it, that is an opportunity wasted to add value to that individual. You want to edify and uplift a mentor, then do what he or she says, and then return and report how that actually worked. And I'm telling you, that goes a long way to build out a very beneficial relationship for both of you. No question about it. It's a great point. They will invest in you as long as they see an ROI return on investment. 100%. 100%. Let's go into places. Again, just in the spirit of not going too deep into this because guys, there's a book you can just buy and read that will get into this more specifically. Let's get into some of the places that we ought to position ourselves in order to pursue this passion or this interest that we're engaged in. Yeah, the first place in the book, second section, is the place where you are. And I'm most excited about this one because, again, this is one that I think a lot of people, not just guys, we overlook this. Let me give you an example, and then I'll teach on it. I got a phone call about three or four months ago from a guy in Charlotte, North Carolina, and he said, Ken, I need your help because I know now what I want to do. I've always loved video production. I'd love to eventually produce television movies, things of that nature. I love video production. And I'm good at it. So I know it's in my sweet spot using my talents to perform my passion. See, the problem is I live in Charlotte, North Carolina. I got three kids. I got a mortgage. And it's just not realistic for me to move to Los Angeles right now. And I paused for a second. I went, I got some great news for you, bro. You don't have to move to Los Angeles. I paused again, and I could hear his brain. I could literally hear the gears grind. Okay, I think Ken is confident about this. I'm not sure I agree with him, but okay, I'm game. And I let him soak on it for a half second. Okay. And then I said, how many production companies do you think are in Charlotte, North Carolina off the top of your head? And he started chuckling because now he knew where I was going. And he goes dozens, I'm sure. I go promise you, there's dozens. Okay. I said, you need to figure out a way to replace your current income working for a production company in Charlotte. We now know that movies, you know, every state in the country has incentives to try to get Hollywood to come to their state, they give them tax breaks, you know, company. We don't even realize how many movies and television shows are shot all around us, no matter where we live. And then again, I said, I said, how many local commercials do you notice every night you're watching TV? He goes, all bunch. I got there pretty awful. Some of them aren't that he goes, Oh, yeah, I go, you know, who's producing those? I said, small production company. I said, you see really good local commercials? He goes, Oh, yeah. I said, who's producing those? He said, good production companies. You know, you got political commercials. So the point is, with websites now, every website that's decent, it's got video on it. Who's making these videos? And he goes production companies. He's kind of like, you know, like the student is. Yeah, he's had now. He knows it, right? Yeah, yeah. So I looked at him. Well, I didn't look at him. It's over the phone. I said, I said, here's the deal. Everything you need to get started is already around you. And I said, it's the law of the zip code. And I made it up right on the spot. The law of the zip code says that everything you need to get started is already around you. So the first place I talk about in the book is to kind of again help fight this doubt, like, Oh, it's too hard of a climb. I can't make this climb because I can't fly to the Mount Everest. I can't even afford a ticket to get to the base camp. And that's a bunch of nonsense. You can start training right now to climb Mount Everest, right where you are, you start running, you got sidewalks in your neighborhood, start running. So the analogy holds that no matter what it is we want to do, that there are steps we can take, the early steps can all be done right where you are. So the reason I make that the first place, and I'm excited about sharing that is because that will help guys not get locked up and be afraid to take the first step because there is no step four, five, six, seven, eight and beyond unless there's step one, that first bold step and that first bold step for me, Ryan, was taking a broadcasting class right in Atlanta right there. I didn't have to move to New York, didn't have to move to Chicago, didn't have to move to LA. I am living my dream in Nashville. So, and I got started in Atlanta. So the first place is the place where you are. There's always first steps to learn, do and connect. That's what proximity does, allows me to learn, do, connect, and you can do that where you are. Yeah, 100%. I mean, I think about with my podcast, there was a friend of mine in town about 20 minutes away from me and he had started a podcast and had a co-op, like a co-op working space and he was instructing other people how to start their own podcasts. I mean, a friend of mine right there, I mean, what an amazing opportunity that was right in front of me and took him up on that offer to sit down and walk through that and the rest is history. You know, but it's funny though because what I hear a lot of guys say or at least think is that because they can't take the greatest step that they would like to, they aren't even willing to take the baby step that they probably ought to. I mean, I ran into this in my financial planning practice all the time. I'd have people that say, you know, I want to save a lot of money and I want to invest and do all these great things with my finances, but I'm not really in the position I want to be in right now. So I'll just wait till I get there. It's like, well, you'll never get there. It's the same guy who says, you know, I know I need to get strong and lose 30 pounds and I need to go to the gym to do that, but I don't want to go to the gym until I'm fit. That's why we go to the gym. It's like, start where you can take the step so you can take to your point step four, five, six, seven, eight and so on. That's exactly right. You know, there's tremendous momentum after you take the first step and you realize, hey, I'm not an idiot. I'm not a fool. I didn't fail. I'm not homeless. I didn't starve. I'm going to take step two. You know, it's it's there's just something about the momentum of not just surviving, but feeling as though, hey, I actually thrived in this step. And I feel like I got what it takes for step two, three and four. And to your point, you can't take on Mount Everest. You got to train before you even get a chance and then you got to hang out at base camp for a while. I mean, it's a journey, man. And I think when we truly understand that, there's nobody listening right now, Ryan, that disagrees with that statement. Nobody, nobody disagrees with, oh, Ken's, Ken's a is a motivational, you know, mumbo jumbo guy. No, I said it's a journey. Take a long time. But here's the deal. We agree with me, but then we don't act like we believe that. Because we just want it now. We want we're looking for the express version. Give me the fast pass. No, I'm gonna tell you something. It doesn't work that way. But but here's what I do know. If we take what we believe that it is a journey that it takes time, then let's actually take some action that is based on that belief. So I'm not going to try to get there in six months. What I'm going to do is spend six weeks taking a course that gives me some knowledge and maybe some experience that I've never had before. And I'm going to be okay taking six weeks and only focusing on that. That's all I'm going to focus on is I'm going to go to a podcast webinar. I'm going to join a mastermind group. And I'm only going to do that. And I'm going to be okay with what I learned and who I connect with from that. And then I'm going to sit back and go, okay, great. What can I use from that to help me move forward? And what's the next thing I'm focused on? When I started training for the half marathon last year, I'd never run before in my life ever other than soccer in high school. You know, when you're a kid, you don't even need to be in shape and just run forever. And I can tell you this, I didn't my first run was not a 30 minute run. My first run was 20 minutes and it wasn't at a 10 minute or a nine minute pace. It was my coach said, don't even look at your watch. Just run really easy, barely even like just beyond a walk, just do 20 minutes at the slowest pace. That's not a walk. And then we moved up from there. But I mean, it was a week of just really easy 20 minute runs. Yeah, I mean, you just got to you just got to take it with that time. I think I think the biggest challenge guys have in this is what they see on social media is they see that other individuals, well, let me put it this way. They're seeing what they perceive to be overnight successes. You know, for example, if they stumbled across Order of Man today, they never heard it before. They're going to think, oh man, you know, Ryan's good at podcasting or look at this incredible following. And because they saw it just popped up on their feed, they think that I happen to just pop up. I'm like, this is this is six years in the making four years with Order of Man and two years prior to that in my financial planning practice, where I was testing things that I would inevitably pull over into what we're doing now. And I think what guys want to do is they want to, they want it to be easy for other individuals because then they give themselves an excuse, right? An excuse because it's not, it's not easy for me, or I just haven't got lucky yet. I just need to sit back and wait for my lucky, fortunate event to happen. Well, it's not going to happen like that. And very rarely is the guy who successful had any stroke of luck, fortunate event, sure, but he's been able to capitalize and opportune and take full advantage of those opportunities. Well, two thoughts on what you just said, because you're spot on number one, the only person that you guys should be comparing yourself to is yesterday's you. That's it. Compare yourself only to the you of yesterday. Am I better today than I was yesterday? Am I in a better position today than I was yesterday? That that is great healthy comparison. Any other comparison is a cancer for your soul. Second thought, is that there is no, there is no substitute for consistency. And when I consistently put myself in the right places and around the right people, opportunity actually will find me, not the other way around. And you'll be able to recognize it and capitalize on it. Yes. Yeah. So these fortunate events you're talking about, yes, they're fortunate, but there's only one reason why you and I have had some fortune. The only reason is because we put ourselves in the right place and around the right people and oh, by the way, we stayed there. Long enough to make it work, right? Long enough for the right time to happen. Here's a simple silly way to say it. If I am not in the right place, the right time cannot and will not happen. Yeah, I know. I know that's crazy deep. You guys will take your water recovery over that. But we laugh about that, but think about that for a second. So if you're a guy right now and you're listening to this, you're going, I'm not getting any opportunities. I can't catch a break. I'll tell you right now, you're not in the right place. And that's not a magic formula. It doesn't mean that the first time you go to the right place, you're going to get, you know, express shuttle to success. Keep in mind this formula is right people plus right places. Stay there and then opportunity happens. So here's the point. When I continue to get there and stay there around the right people, right places, opportunity actually shows up right in front of me into your point, Ryan. Not only do I see it, I can seize it. It's so true. You know, it's really funny. It reminds me a couple of weekends ago, I took my two oldest boys to watch a baseball game. And towards the end of the game, the home team was behind. And they had a runner on first and second, if I remember, and two outs. And then it was 0 and 2 on this batter. And I'm like, well, this guy's going to strike out. So the pitcher throws a ball. He foul tips it. Pitcher throws another ball foul tip, throws a couple of balls, throws another strike. He foul tips it. So he's like just battling, right? Just staying in the game, giving himself a chance. And I swear it, man must have been 10 pitches into this, into this series. And the guy hits a rope into right field, a double scores one runner. And it just now they went on to lose the game after all. But it illustrates the point perfectly. Like he was up there at the plate. He was battling, battling, battling, battling. A pitch came in, deflected it off. Another pitch deflected it off. And then finally, because he gave himself an opportunity and kept swinging the bat, he was able to give himself an opportunity to line one into right field. I mean, it's a perfect analogy for what you're talking about here. Absolutely. I love that. I love it. You know what else I love about that baseball analogy is, is, is not only was he battling at the plate in that particular moment in the game, what we didn't see and what you and your kids didn't see, was how much batting practice he took that week. Or he's just in there taking cuts, taking cuts, taking cuts, taking cuts. We practice, we take a lot of cuts so that when we get in the game, we can fight off as many pitches as possible. And we know that if I keep swinging at pitches, I'm going to connect with one. And you know, that's how you do it. And by the way, that's another great analogy because there's times where you're going to hit a single right and you wanted to hit a triple shut up or or sometimes you're going to hit a pot fly and the game's over. You know, that's just the way it goes sometimes. Yeah, or strike out and really miss the back curve ball. I can't tell you how many times I bailed out of the batter's box with a curve ball. I was bailing out like a scaredy cat. And you know, those days are going to happen. But I'm at the plate. I'm right where I'm supposed to be. I got a bat. I'm ready to go. I love that analogy. It's really rich. Yeah. Yeah. Well, Ken, I appreciate the conversation. I know guys are going to get a lot from this. This is just guys were just scratching the surface. I mean, and going through this book and knowing a little bit more about what Ken's about and his radio show and everything else he's doing. I'm telling you, if you guys feel like you're in the position of, you know, something's missing, right? Like you're doing this work and you're not engaged and it's not calling to you. And maybe you're not making the kind of money you feel you want to be making, then Ken, I really appreciate you as a resource because this is what guys need for sure. Well, thank you. I enjoy this. I'm passionate and I just want guys to believe there is a role and they can get that right on. Well, hey, as we wind down, let me ask you those couple of questions that I that I prepped before a little bit. The first one is what does it mean to be a man? What does it mean to be a man? What a heavy question that is. I think it means that at the end of each day, after you've worked hard for the right reasons, the right work for the results, for the people that it supports, whether that be the customer or the family that you're exhausted, you're exhausted mentally and emotionally because you've given it you're all doing something that matters deeply to you. But then you come home and you step right in and you're helping out with dinner, the dogs, the kids and homework and you're 100% there. And then you get the kids in bed, which is also emotionally exhausted, exhausting. And when the kids are in bed, then we got to sit down with the wife and make sure she gets her words out and that you're leaning into her and whatever role she's in, whether it's in the home or out of the office, excuse me, out of the home and you're leaning into her. And so now you're really, really emo, you've got nothing else you've given everything you can to everybody else. And you walk in whatever your nighttime routine is and you get in that bed and when you get in that bed, you're just like a balloon that's just lost all of its air and you just emotionally and physically and spiritually exhausted in a good way because you've given everything you can. I think that's what it means to be a man. You paint, you paint an amazing picture. That's a great scene, something I strive to be like. I appreciate that for sure. Well, Ken, how do we connect with you, get a copy of the book and then tune into the radio show and anything else that you have going on? How do we connect? Ken Coleman.com is the website. We've got some great resources that are free there for folks that can really help you in your journey. That's where we can get all the information on the Sirius XM show. Sirius XM 111 is where we're live every day at two Eastern and then we podcast each daily show as well. And you can just get that Apple podcast or quite frankly anywhere that podcasts are available. And so that's a great resource as well to not only listen to but to share if you get some guys that are struggling with identity and confidence and all those things. And then of course, the book is The Proximity Principle. It really is a practical plan. I'm going to walk you by the hand up to the right people and into the right places and show you that doing work you love and getting there is not the impossible task. And I want as many people as possible to get this so that there's hope that there is a role and hope that there is a plan. So that's where you can connect social media. We're on YouTube. We've got clips of the show every day on YouTube, Ken Coleman Show, Instagram at Ken Coleman Show, Twitter at Ken Coleman, Facebook, Ken Coleman Show. So I think that's everywhere. But Ryan, I'm so grateful for the opportunity to have a conversation. And I want to say that the work you're doing is as valuable as anything that's happening in a podcast or in a broadcast for men to get the message that you're sharing. So I'm honored and privileged. But I also want to say what you're doing really, really matters. Thank you, Ken. That means a lot. I will definitely link everything up so the guys know where to go and likewise that the work that you're doing and the level of appreciation that I have for you and what it is you're doing has certainly helped me, you know, to be a better father and husband, business owner. And as I read proximity principal, it's really opened my eyes up to some things that maybe I knew, but I didn't quite know how to articulate. And then also some things I didn't know, which I'll be able to implement in my life as well. So I definitely appreciate you taking some time to share with us today. There you go, gentlemen, my conversation with one and only Ken Coleman about the proximity principal. I think all of us were probably to some degree, at least, at least somewhat familiar with the idea of the proximity principal, which is being in the right place at the right time and knowing the right people and having access to the right information and knowing what you want. And of course, all the things that we talked about on the podcast today, I would highly, highly encourage you to pick up a copy of the book I've read it personally. And I can tell you, I'm going to be implementing some things in my life to help further this cause and further this movement. And I'll tell you, there has not been a single thing in my life that hasn't involved networking, that hasn't involved being in the right places, that hasn't involved having the right connections and through Ken's work and the book and everything that we talked about today, I know I'm going to be more capable because I'm going to be in the right places at the right time. And I'm going to deliberately and intentionally put myself in those situations. So make sure you check that out. Also, as we part, again, just a bug in your ear, if you will, for the event that we're going to be doing in July and Mayne, you may want to look at clearing your schedule that last weekend of July because I'm going to show you our new homestead, if you will, and we're going to put together a phenomenal, phenomenal event filled with iron council guys and order of man guys. I'm thinking we're probably going to cap it around 200 guys. So if you are going to come, you're going to want to sign up quick. So make sure you subscribe. Also make sure you follow me on Instagram. That's where I'm most active at Ryan Mickler, my CH L E R because when I get you the final dates for our event, that's where I'm going to do it. So make sure again, you're following me on Instagram, Twitter's the same at Ryan Mickler and I'm very active on both of those. Anyways, guys, that's all I've got for you. Go pick up a copy of the book, subscribe, leave a rating and review, band with us, continue to share this movement, honored to be on this path with you. We're doing great things when it comes to reclaiming and restoring masculinity in the society that it definitely needs to be reclaimed and restored. So until tomorrow for our Ask Me Anything, go out there, take action, become the man you are meant to be. Thank you for listening to the Order of Man podcast. You're ready to take charge of your life and be more of the man you were meant to be. We invite you to join the order at quarterofman.com."
