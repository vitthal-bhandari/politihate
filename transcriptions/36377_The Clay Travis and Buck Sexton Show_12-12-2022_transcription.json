Again that's pre-born.com slash b-u-c-k sponsored by pre-born. Shoulder to shoulder shield time. Welcome to the bucks accident show. Team welcome to the Freedom Hut Monday December 12 edition of the program. We have a high profile transitioner to female. Kristen Beck who has now reportedly called that transition the worst decision he has ever made because he is going back to being a he. He's a former member of the US Navy Seals. He got a lot of media attention for that initial transition to female to become a trans female many years ago. We will discuss what this means for the trans movement plus more Twitter files dropping over the weekend. The Libs in total meltdown and disarray about so much of that. And I have also for your listening enjoyment some fauci time to get into today because Fauci is out there telling everybody that he has nothing to hide. He didn't do anything political. He thinks that you know it was tough. We probably needed lockdowns even though lockdowns are terrible. All that stuff. Fauci is the absolute worst. Get into it in a second my friends. And yeah you ever wanted to invest in real estate but you didn't have the time to do it on your own. That's what I felt myself until I met my friends and done for your real estate. And now I own through an LLC with my brothers five houses. We have five houses that are real estate investments. We pooled our money together. And once you understand how to do this it becomes so straightforward. But you need experts to guide you along to be there to answer any questions to help you troubleshoot if something comes up. And I mean guide you to where you should invest. Pick the house out. Why it's a good investment. They walk you through all the numbers. So they turn you into a real estate investor. You understand what you're doing and why this is good for your long term financial stability and growth. You got to do it the right way. Go to done for you buck.com to see how this works. Again that's done for you buck.com one more time done for you buck.com to begin your real estate investment journey today. And I do think that this is something that once you see what the upside is and how intelligent this strategy is this process you'll be really really impressed. Now Kristen Beck is a former Navy Seal reportedly a member of Seal Team six. And we all know that we are supposed to accept anybody who claims to be trans that this is an essential truth. And that if you have any questions about this in fact if you try to stop them from transitioning let's say or you don't want to use their preferred pronoun anything like that at all. You're a bad person. In fact you're a big it. Maybe you should have some of your rights taken away. You're a horrible human being. We know this is the these are the rules in the world of the trans agenda. So you have to you have to affirm it. So a six foot five two hundred and eighty pound guy who says I want to play women's rugby now which this this actually happened. Maybe it was six four. You have to say yeah that's a female. And remember the trans female we are told is not a trans female. It is a female. The same as any other which is why we're also told that men can get pregnant even though we know that men can't get pregnant. This is about absolute control and the destruction of the most basic foundation of Western civilization as we know which is the family and gender. All of this is tied in together. And so that's why the left will play this game simultaneously of why is it such a big deal to you when we focus on it and then they keep pushing and pushing and getting more radical and getting crazier. And then the moment we say hold on a second well you know you drag queen story hour for four year olds you're teaching you're teaching highly sexualized content to kids that are in in grade school from these adult males with prosthetic breasts with fishnets stockings on and I mean what is going on here they go well why are you such a bigot why are you making such a big deal of it we know the game that they play we see it it's obvious. Well I remember when Kristen Beck who was a Navy SEAL 20 years of service United States military transitioned and that was used the media held this up as see our bravest and our best are often trans there's nothing about mental health or mental health issues that relates to being trans this is about living one's truth our elite warriors this was the line our elite warriors can and are or can be and are sometimes trans so how dare you question any of this that was the line she as in Kristen Beck he is living her truth that's where they told us well now there's a big backlash because Kristen Beck has blasted the VA for giving him hormones after a single hour long consultation and calls the sex change operation he did have operations not a full down downstairs you know transition but a facial sort of a shaving they do the face to look at appear more feminine did do serious surgery to transition to female and now he says and I can say he because he's a he he isn't it right now we all agree it's a he was always a he it's amazing you read this article in the Daily Mail by the way and you you end up seeing um that they use they pronoun or they pronouns as well as he as well as she because what what do you even do at this point once you've seeded that pronouns are something that you have to out of some deference use not based on reality but based on whatever somebody feels internally well they can change that at will so then you have to keep shifting around the pronouns to keep them happy right that's the only way and that is in fact what they do in this article it's crazy but what does it mean if somebody can transition that was living his essential truth as a her but now he is saying I was never a her this was a disaster this was awful effectively this this this decorated navy seal was going through a mental a psychological episode and the fashion of the moment with regard to trans ideology pushed him far down this pathway and it was now something that that he says the worst decision he's ever made in his life it was horrible so what does it mean if you can transition and then detransition can you just go back and forth but let's really think this through for a moment can you become a man on Tuesday and then a woman on Thursday and then go back to being a woman about a man rather the following Monday if not why not what exactly is it based on if night psychology and the feelings that a person has it's not based on biology we know that much it's not even based on a specific surgery or a specific medical procedure that's not the case so what is it it's a feeling oh they say it's an intrinsic truth but if it's an intrinsic truth to that person and if you therefore have any problem with it you're a bigot how can it change oh I know what they're going to say it hasn't really changed that you can only change one way this is what the activists will tell you and that now the mental health issue only comes into play when the trans female says I'm actually a male I never should have done this I was always a male they lied to me you'll see this now by the way they're not going to spend any time covering this story either because it complicates their narrative so much another instance of this where the internal truth of the individual somehow doesn't matter at all is in the the mass shooter the mass murderer at the q night club in Colorado that individual claims to be non-binary now they're just putting out analysis and news organizations over the weekend saying that that person isn't really non-binary oh how do they make that determination based on what that person has used they pronouns for years by the way it wasn't just somebody who went in and committed this heinous mass murder and then as some form of trolling decided to say I'm non-binary he'd been non-binary for years at least by his own declaration years prior to the mass murder event and so on what basis are they saying he's not non-binary who is the judge of these things and and even more importantly what are the standards by which we are all supposed to judge these things so what also does it mean when we're told that you're a bad person if you don't use pronouns as if pronouns are something that someone can just shift like a like a t-shirt you know just change it day in and day out you're you're a bigot if you just think that a pronoun is based on whether someone's a he or a she well what if you could become a she and then he again which is what we're seeing and then also just it's it's exactly what you would expect when it comes to the way that christian back feels exploited the left completely exploits the left wants as many children to medically transition as possible this white house the by demonstration this goes all the way to the top they want children to take drugs used for castrating sex offenders they want children to or you know adolescents to have their breasts removed that they're female so-called top surgery they want the mutilation of people's genitalia to occur it is not in fact true that you can create female genitalia out of mail in fact the people who really know about this it's appalling what they are doing to people it's awful what they it is medical malpractice and it's evil but it's fashionable and the people that are doing it what's so poisonous what's so destructive about this the people that are doing it and pushing it they think they're the good guys they think they're heroes for doing this they're not ashamed at all whether it's children whether it's people going through a psychological episode doesn't matter transition as many people as possible as fast as possible destroy the separation that we have culturally emotionally psychologically from gender in society destroy that barrier that's what they seek to do and whatever the the social and individual casualties are along the way they just don't care this is what we were up against it is important to know how the other side operates i'll talk here in a second about the latest on twitter but you know twitter's in the news a lot including the revelation that there were five million user accounts that were exposed recently in a software vulnerability it's a lot of personal information that then gets out there and these happen all the time all it takes is one employee of a big company to click on the wrong email and all of a sudden they've got a fishing scam underway and they can get access to this stuff and then they post it on the dark web so your information's out there in the dark web what are you going to do about this well your personal information is getting exposed a lot you need life lock to watch your back life lock detects and alerts you to potential identity threats you may not spot on your own

to lifelock.com use my name promo code buck for 25 percent off now the latest twitter revelations show more of what we had already thought was going on here's how he Kurtz over on Fox News talking about this on Sunday he says hey this one is once again a bombshell play nine this shows beyond the santilla of a doubt that twitter executives under the previous management were lying i believe the technical term is a crock when they said oh we don't target conservatives oh we don't uh shadow ban and we certainly don't do it for reasons of ideology it was all about ideology yeah this is a bomb shall Elon Musk has changed the conversation uh with this and one last point which is that if you were a conservative who's complained about this you were kind of dismissed as being conspiracy theorists you were paranoid you know what you were talking about well turns out those people on the right who said they were being targeted they were right they were right obviously and what do we do about this now well it's important that we all see the situation for what it is big tech has colluded together and done everything that they can to make sure that we don't have three exchange of ideas and in a in a place where you're talking about elections based upon an informed electorate we don't have straight up sham elections like what at Turkmenistan 97 percent all vote for the same person that's what democrats would like here they think that would be more moral they think that would be better but Elon Musk understands the stakes it is civilization itself he says if the battle against wokeness he tweeted it so the weekend the battle against wokeness is lost nothing else matters and it is true wokeness is a civilization destroyer everything that is good about the american civilization is put in jeopardy directly by wokeness that's just that's what you can see from all the outcomes here because there's no outer limit to it right creativity gone free speech gone freedom of conscience gone humor gone what what is america without these things what is this place just like a big rest stop you know get some potato chips get the gasoline that you're ration before they give you your tiny electric car and maybe tell you to eat some bugs i mean what what really is the future of america without those things elon gets it he understands it and that's that's why it's remarkable to see somebody who is the richest man in the world taking it upon himself to fight this fight in this way and then there's fauci little fauci uh he's atrocious he's the worst the absolute worst little fauci in the world he said the following um that he is happy to go out there and testify before congressional probes because he thinks it's bizarre that politicians are upset with people like him play clip four it's a bit bizarre i think in our day and age to have health officials who are doing nothing more than trying to get people to be safe and save their health and their lives and their family to get attacked in a way not only me but my my family my children and my wife that is really bizarre but i am very happy to testify before any congressional oversight committee i have nothing to hide i can explain and validate everything that i've done so you know it's going to be inconvenient if they actually are out there essentially threatening to make my life miserable but it's i mean i'm going to do what i need to do and that is cooperate fully because we have nothing to hide at all notice notice to have what a slime ball he is and how initially says people are threatening my wife and children and then he starts talking about congressional oversight well hold on a second are congressmen threatening your wife and children oh you mean you create this little i'm a victim all the big bad mean trump supporters are anybody who threatens fauci's wife and children is a disgraceful moron who actually helps the authoritarian apparatus in its perpetuation of fauci's lies all right you don't threaten someone's wife and children ever period full stop but that's not what the right that's not what rann paul that's not what members of congress are trying to do or advocating for they want answers in a congressional forum as to why fauci lied and was the worst about everything but you see you see what a slimy little infighter he is oh they're threatening my family but sure i'll speak to congress well what is one and one has nothing to do with the other but he understands prompt again but that's really how he stayed in his job for 50 years or whatever it is he knows how to manipulate perception he knows how to work the bureaucracy and he's still holding out that what he did was reasonable what he did was malevolent it was sadistic it is awful the fact that you still go into a lot of doctors offices and people are saying you have to mask up that's because fauci refuses to come out and say masking is stupid it does nothing it does nothing when you say oh but maybe you'll reduce the transmission 10 percent for the for the 10 minutes once a week you wear the mask in the doctor's office idiotic idiotic and everybody who can think for themselves knows it but fauci is is a he is a he is a relic he is almost like a a holy relic for the left and so they're gonna do everything they can to prop him up he's gonna get a huge book deal here five million ten million
