    "text": " The president and vice president hit with a backlash over their Memorial Day messages and Dr. Fauci caches in on COVID a new book deal. You guys are going to lose your minds today and it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez. Today joined by my friends. We've got Eric July, pleased to be contributor Eric July and also Matthew Marston, filmmaker, actor, just Jack of all trades extraordinaire Matthew Marston who we just like we like to have him on the show because A, he knows a lot but B, we just like to listen to him talk. So I'll take that. My wife doesn't like that. Oh really? She's over it? Yeah, she's totally over it. She's British too. No, she's more. She's okay. Okay. Oh, so I bet her accent is pretty nice too. Yeah, she's got a cool accent. Okay, we're going to have to have her on to second. So over the weekend, a lot of backlash surrounding both the vice president and presidents Memorial Day messages. Now, of course, it started with vice president Kamala Harris who tweeted out I believe that this was on Friday. She tweeted out a picture of herself with the caption Enjoy the Long weekend. Kind of like a pile on after that point. I'm sorry, this was Saturday. It was kind of like a pile on at that point with people pointing out, enjoy the long weekend. Not really like, do you know why we have the long weekend? Do you know why this is a holiday weekend? Which prompted her to tweet out later on, I believe this was the next day throughout our history, our servicemen and women have risked everything to defend our freedoms in our country as we prepare to honor them on Memorial Day. We remember their sacrifice their service and their sacrifice much different than the the picture of oneself and the caption Enjoy the long weekend. Let's go ahead. I want to get your thoughts, but let me go ahead and throw in President Biden and what he had to say as well. So President Biden actually gave a Memorial Day speech and of course couldn't miss an opportunity to push for diversity, talk about how democracy was under attack and of course, empathy here is a little bit of that speech watch. The lives of billions from antiquity to our own hour have been shaped by the battle between aspirations of the many in the greed of the few between people right to self-determination and the self-seeking of the dictator between dreams of democracy and appetites for autocracy, which we're seeing around the world. Our troops have fought this battle on fields around the world, but also the battle of our time and the mission falls to each of us each and every day. Democracy itself is in peril here at home and around the world. What we do now, what we do now, how we honor the memory of the fallen will determine whether or not democracy will long endure. Empathy is the fuel of democracy. Let me say that again. Empathy, empathy is the fuel of democracy. Our willingness to see each other, not as enemy, as neighbors, even we disagree to understand what the others going through. Empathy is the fuel for democracy, democracy, democracy. Eric, I have a feeling that you have something to say about that. Aside from all that other stuff that I let you guys handle the more militaristic stuff, let me just speak on that specific thing when hearing that. It just makes me cringe to the point where I'm about to pop a blood vessel myself because look, it's not just, I know the cliche thing is to say, America is not a democracy, which it's not effectively though, unfortunately it is trending in that way, but what I get so frustrated at is how world leaders, politicians talk about that concept as it is inherently a good thing. And it's not, it's never been, and it's even more rampant than it may just be me. Maybe I haven't been paying attention as much. A lot of folks have been around longer than I have. Maybe they always talk this way. But when I hear these guys speak about democracy nowadays, it's like that's all there is, and it's the greatest thing ever. No, it is basically tools and a lamb deciding on what's to eat for dinner. That's effectively all that it's ever have been. And it's moronic idea that people get to come to get as funny because he mentions self-determination. That is antithetical to democracy, antithetical, which I would agree with the idea of self-determination, individualism and individuality, these guys being able to ask individuals to pursue whatever it is they want. But to hear these idiots who may have gotten their position by way of this process, which is why they like it. So much talk about democracy as if it's just such a lovely thing, and we have to fight for it. Don't seem to understand that for guys like myself, the people that actually value liberty when you say something is threatening democracy, you are threatening me with a good time. Yeah, I mean, whenever I watch these things like, you know, look at what Kamala Harris said and what he said, I always think about the people that are actually writing these things because there's no way, Biden's not sitting there and neither is she. Right. So who are they surrounding themselves with that don't understand the fabric of this country? They don't understand, you know, it's a republic, it's not a democracy, as you were saying. I know that. I came to learn that when I came here because I think it's important to understand the country that you're living in when you come from another one. Right. And I just think that when you, it concerns me when I see, you can imagine them all sitting around, you know, everyone that they're in the pool, whatever, they're like, you're having a good weekend. I'm going to have a great, we're going to have a barbecue to my brother. And that's what's going on in their world. Right. They're not thinking about the men and women that died to preserve this country and our freedoms. Right. It's just the truth. So to me, what what is alarming is a reflection of the people that are really pulling the strings behind the people that are out. And then you know, you can imagine them like after that tweet, wait a minute, because I saw that tweet on, I think it was on Sunday, right? And then there was the pylon, like you said, there was just, and then I'm like, okay, you can imagine more going, oh, we got it wrong, quick. You know, what are we going to say? Say something about the country that's about people that sacrifice. And then there's all these words, they just keep spamming out. When I watch that, that speech, it just sounds like gobbledygook to me. It's just like saying a lot of stuff about nothing at all. Yeah, no, it's interesting, too, when he talked about diversity has always been an incredible strength when it comes to the armed forces, because we've been seeing this push with the new ads, the new military ads, with diversity, equity, inclusion, well, I have two lesbian moms, and that's why I joined the Air Force. It's like, why are we focusing? I mean, call me crazy, but I feel like when it comes to our armed forces and our military, we maybe should be focusing on just like the strength of it, rather than what the hell color of skin everyone has, and what, you know, they identify as and whether or not their gender fluid. Well, that's just the other things that they advocate that have basically infiltrated basically that. I mean, those are the things that they obviously focus on. I mean, it's the highest level you've ever traded. Right, right, they don't care about merit based on anything. Say what you will about, like military, everybody here knows something, I know I can set the tables on how I feel about what they do is another conversation, but you would think that all things, right, this whole protection, protection idea, you would think that that's what it would be about, it'd be about merit more than anything, how you look, how you act. None of that matters. Can you pass X amount of, you know, whatever again is merit, merit based, do you have the skill set to feel this particular position? Now, you think that of all things, even if I did concede that it was a legitimate thing, you think of all things hell, we'll take it back to like a problem militia. If we even looked at it from that standpoint, you want those people to be the best suited for that job, but it doesn't matter if they have a one eye, you know, whatever skin tone brown, purple, black doesn't yell, it doesn't matter what what the skin tone is, but that's not what they're pushing. They're focusing so much on this whole diversity element, this whole diversity is our strength, which really make any sense because it's really not like that doesn't mean anything. The makeup of something, which is what the point that I've been driving home when it comes to this concept, the makeup is irrelevant to whether or not that is a good or bad thing. This is why I say when it comes to diversity, that's just a symptom. Like, sometimes some things may have an over or well, it's no such thing as an over under representation, but you get it. Maybe example, I always use track and field athlete with my entire life if I owned or sprint facility or something where I trained athletes, most of them probably that are coming through are going to be black. That's just the nature of what it is. That doesn't mean that just because my staff or that it is working, that athletes that come through are predominantly black, there's something wrong with that or that we're actively keeping out some sort of person. No, that's just naturally how it happened. But for you guys that do value like the, you know, the militaristic institution, you should be scared for your life. The fact that that are that Marxist bull crap that they're putting out there has infiltrated that. So you thought it was immune to it? Oh, it was not, not even close. Matt, I can just imagine like Russia is coming to attack us or, you know, whoever China and but we're like, well, we'll outwoke you because why have two lesbian moms? So take that. Oh, you're shooting me. This is it. The most important thing is that the military is the most efficient lethal force in the world. They're about killing the other people. Hopefully the threat of killing the others means that that never happens. But of course, that's the only thing that matters is how efficient you are at what you do. Here's the strange thing is I've been very fortunate to work with a lot of branches in the military over my career. And they do not care about color. None of those things has ever come up. In fact, you ask a Marine about that and they just say, no, you know, I'm a Marine. That's it. I'm green. You know, we're all this one. So nobody cares about that. Both on the ground. Yeah, yeah, nobody cares. But anyway, and here's the other thing, the thing that really drives me crazy about this diversity stuff is they don't apply universally, right? Diversity is strength, right? Is our strength apart from when I disagree with you, apart from when you think differently to me, then I'm going to destroy you, right? Then it's not strong, then you're a threat. Okay. So if diversity is that that's fine. And the other thing that I know is coming to America is that if you embrace the American, the idea of what America is all about, then it doesn't matter what sex you are, what, what, you know, any color, where you come from, whether you're British or, you know, come from another country, what matters is you're all joined in focusing on the American dream and what it is to be an American. And that actually unites people. So what they're doing is they're putting the rest of the stuff first. You know what I'm saying? Instead of the stuff they should be focusing on. Yeah. All right. Before we leave the topic of President Biden, the backlash continued for him over the weekend. He was, he was giving some remarks on, he was speaking at a joint base Langley Eustis in Hampton, Virginia. And he was talking about being joined by Governor Northam. And he like randomly pointed to some little girl in the crowd and made some very disturbing comments about a counter. Here's that. I'm especially honored to share the stage with Brittany and Jared and Nathan and Margaret Catherine. I love those threats in her hair, man. I tell you what, I'm looking at her. She looks like he's 19 years old sitting there with like a little lady in her waistcoat. I that's not what you want to be saying when you've been accused of sexual harassment and assault. Okay. Because I just like I can, if I were a fly on the wall, I can see his handlers at that moment as he is like, what are we going to do? Oh crap. Oh, who's he talking about? Oh God, she's eight. Okay. All right. What do we do now? I mean, it was very bizarre because he was like, I'm honored to be joined by Governor Northam to Congressman, you know, these people, these people. Oh, I love that little girl with the barrettes in her hair. She's, she's cute. She looks so old for her age. Was it just me or was that weird? That was bizarre. There's no way around that. That was about as weird as it gets definitely when you consider that he's when he's been around these young folk with us. They touch his leg hair. Look at all the compilation videos that are out there. I'm like doing some very weird things when he is around the specifically little girls. So when that happens, he can't be that and maybe he is that a nap to where he's not aware of that. People kind of feel that way think about that. That's the absolute worst thing. Unfortunately, it's not just his handlers, but the people that support this idiot are going to write it off as all he's just that old grandpa, right, uncle. That's kind of how they act. And it's not good. That was a really weird bizarre thing because I was out of nowhere. Yeah, which is like, oh, if that is that, if that's how your uncle acts, you guys got a problem. Yeah, weird uncle Joe. You're like, yeah, we're not going to see him. We're not standing on the fourth of July. You don't go seal by himself and stuff like that. It was really weird. It was it was really weird. Okay, I'm glad it wasn't just it's just when you put it into context with all the other weird things that he has on video of either saying about little kids or actually doing to them is once you put it into context, it just becomes clear. Well, what gets me is nobody covers it. You know, really, it's just like, Oh, like you said, it's it's nothing. It's nothing. I'm like, you know, if that was your door, and I'm sure you've seen the video where the mom is like pulling the door through the way. I mean, whatever you do, don't go don't watch YouTube on Joe Biden sniffing off because it's a very, very deep rabbit hole. You'll go down. You might not come out of it. We've got more to come first. We want to thank our sponsor home title lock today. So if you guys do not know the crime of home title theft, which by the way, the FBI calls one of the fastest growing crimes in America, consider yourself lucky because that means it hasn't happened to you. And this is of course where cyber thieves remove you from your home's title. They forge your signature on a quick claim deed and then they can refile and become the new owner. And then all of the retirement nest egg that you have been saving, all the equity in your house is just gone like that. And you may think when this happens to you that you might be protected from a bank or a common identity theft program, but you're actually not those programs do not protect you from this kind of crime home title lock does though. What home title lock is going to do is put a virtual barrier around your home's title and mortgage and the moment that they detect anyone tampering with it, they will shut it down. All right. Now here's the catch. You're not going to know if you are a victim until it's too late, unless you go to home title lock.com, register your address to see if you are already a victim. If you are, at least you've caught it and you will get 30 free days of protection. If you use promo code radio again, don't know why it's promo code radio. Just go with me here at home title lock.com that is home title lock.com promo code radio. Let's move to the state of Florida for a second. We are of course talking about Governor Ron DeSantis, who I believe is making a giant run for 2024, just doing everything right out Texas in Texas. He's embarrassing us over here being the beacon of freedom and liberty. And of course he kicked off the start of Pride Month by signing a bill into law, the Fairness in Women's Sports Act, the Protects Female Athletes from having to compete against biological males who may call themselves transgender. Here is DeSantis on the signing of Protecting Fairness in Women's Sports Act. First of all, it's not a message to anything other than saying we're going to protect fairness in women's sports. We believe that it's important to have integrity in the competition, and we think it's important that they're able to compete on the level playing field. And you've seen what's happened when you don't have that. So the bill defines a student's biological sex based on the student's official birth certificate at the time of birth. And by the way, I love this part, he played a video at the press conference of biological males competing against girls in track races at the high school level. And of course, smoking, which DeSantis said was blatantly unfair. I just love watching his hand movements because I feel like he's just a more polished Donald Trump. He does the, it's like he's the exact same in so many things, but better somehow. That's, I'm guessing this is obviously returning to a lot of the public school systems and everything that's out there, because that's where a lot of these girls are certainly going to be competing. And so, I mean, you always, when you see the government do something, you always have to say compared to what, you know? So I know that the libertarians and my list, such as myself, would focus as much as, okay, we need to ballast these institutions that, you know, why do they exist? But again, they exist right now, they have monopolized this. What I rather them have, rather than allow women to compete or the girls to compete with other girls, of course. That's a basic thing. And I say this as an athlete, and it's funny you're talking about track, that was my thing. And obviously that's the sport that is almost entirely impacted by this moronic idea that men and women, no matter if one decides to be the other, there's not any sort of advantage or disadvantage, depending on what's there. You have, because we're the exact same, it's the ballast, you know, it's what they tell us to do, except when it comes to that, it shouldn't be that much of a controversial thing to say allow the girls to compete with the girls. But we're so far down in the, or rather in the ludie bend that it is a very controversial thing. And of course they're going to give him hell for doing this on this month, on the first day. I just love it. Which is a big troll job, by the way. It really is. And they asked him about that on the, in the clip, and he's like, I, I don't know. I'm just telling you that this is what the bill is that I'm finding you're right. And we love you for it, Ron. Yeah, no, I mean, I just don't understand now this is controversial. It's like, you're thinking, it's the stupidest thing ever. You know, it's just like, girls should compete with girls, and they shouldn't compete with boys. I mean, like, we are in cloud Kukuland right now, that we have to state this, that this is controversial. I just, I don't get it. It really is a sad state of affairs in 2021. You can get canceled for saying something like, biological men shouldn't compete in women's sports. Which by the way, comes from the same party who brought to you like, we love women and Republicans are waging a war on women and Republicans hate women. They try to erase. You're literally trying to erase us and our records and deprive girls of scholarships. I mean, it's incredible that they still get to pretend like they hold that position. Another thing was happening in Florida, a Florida concert promoter insists he's not preventing unvaccinated fans from coming to an upcoming punk rock show. He said that people without the vaccination, the COVID-19 vaccination, can enter the concert. They just have to pay $999.99 versus if you are vaccinated, you get it for $18. So he said, I'm just, I'm not, I'm just giving you a discount. I'm not denying entry to anyone. Of course, this was because Governor DeSantis also gave a recent executive order saying businesses are not allowed to make patrons prove they've been vaccinated against COVID-19. So I don't know how he's going to actually make people show him that you can't have the vaccine passports. You can't have to prove to someone by showing your papers. But he's saying he's kind of like his little workaround, just well, I might just charge higher ticket prices. But press secretary for around DeSantis's office says that that's not going to happen because charging people more if they don't provide proof of vaccination still unfairly discriminates against people who have enumerated rights under Florida law. Some of us sitting at this table, I don't know, maybe wearing pink and probably the other two here maybe told you guys and you made fun of me when I said you wear the mask, it's going to turn real quick into mandatory vaccines. And here we freaking are. And I don't expect any credit for it. But I'm just saying, I've been saying it the whole time. I'm not salty on it at all. Okay, so this is obviously, this is a pecs of genre that I outperformed for freaking living before I was illegal to actually go perform in front of people. Now I will say this, I do believe now people disagree with me all day long, I'm consistent. I'm an absolute property rights absolutist. So when it comes to the venue and the promoters, they should have the freedom to be able to dictate how much they, yes, is it legal, is it discrimination? Absolutely. But when it comes to private property rights, they have the absolute right. Now that doesn't mean that it is stupid and it doesn't mean that I ain't going to call them out for doing this. This is unfortunately what we've seen. This is a punk rock concert. I believe it's lead foot productions. If I'm not mistaken, it's the name of it. I'm semi familiar with them. But this is what we've seen on a punk metal, metal core, hardcore, all of those genres for the most part are dead. All this whole anti-authoritarian bull crap, anti-authority, anti-establishment crap. No, they walk, I mean, right in line with the Democratic Party, but we've seen them go completely on the opposite end. This ain't punk rock. They got nothing to do with being punk rock. This is the mainstream establishment narrative. And you are going with what he said, or with the owner, I believe, with the production company said, was like, oh, I was just trying to say that I care about people's health. No, what it is that you're doing is you're going with the absolute mainstream narrative. And he's funny using young folk, the people that it's almost like a zero percent chance that they're going to die from this to try to use this as excuse. I just care about their health. This is the main narrative you were trying to incentivize people to get the jab. I would say, America, my band backwards, I would never do anything like that. I would never even perform at a venue that requires people to wear a mask or anything moronic like that. And by the way, again, that ain't punk rock. Get out of here. And nothing says stick it to the man like Jimmy Nixon. He wasn't the government's own. Exactly. You should definitely do what the man asks and do it politely. All the zones are dead. It's so frustrating for me as a to see these guys. And it was just what that was like with the with obviously with COVID. But with the even the writing and all that stuff, it's like whatever comes out of more so the mainstream left is democratic sort of party narrative. That's the appropriate establishment and they these guys actually act as if they are the anti sort of authoritarian side or wing or something of that nature. And that's not what they are. This is the but punk for sure has been dead. It's been dead for a very long time. But if that don't show you that it's dead, I don't know what will show you the genres. Well, John Leiden has come out multiple times and and he's been true to punk rock. Yeah, it's like one or two of them out there and they've been calling calling people out, about this like dude, like this is this not what this is supposed to be about. But unfortunately, that's what it is about now for the for the most part. I encourage you guys who aren't musicians and like these sort of rock based sub genres, they'll they'll they'll speak to it just like I do. These people are freaking loony and unfortunately the people that are part like whether being these bands or part of this sub culture, they feel as if they can't say anything because well, it's off with their head at that point and somewhat they're right. But it doesn't end until people come out and be like, you know what, this ain't what this is about. Yeah, Matt, I know Eric here. I mean, he is our libertarian at the table. So he is very staunchly libertarian on this. Do you how do you feel about a company, you know, with capitalists, free market society? How do you feel about a company being allowed to require that you've gotten vaccines or unfairly discriminating against someone who hasn't? Because I personally, I'm in I agree with where you're going, Eric, but I'm just like, medical privacy. I personally draw the line just curious where you. Yeah, I mean, but I think that then I do agree. I actually agree with both of you on that because I do think that you should be able to do what you want to do is because I think it's a slippery slope once you you stray away from that. But also you just don't have to go. Right. I mean, if someone says you don't, I'm like, I did that with a mask thing. I'm like, oh, I literally walked into a very famous candy company here in America, walked in, I was going to get some chocolates and there was nobody in the store that would be under plastic thing. And I walked in, I said, can I come in without a mask? And she said, no. And I went, all right. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I mean, we do all the time. So it's I think it's the same thing. I mean, obviously it's ridiculous. But what I'd say to your point as well about bands is there's a huge market, the PINGO, PINGO, they're just wanting you to say, you know, to the man, you know, I won't say it's a lot. That's why my band back and stuck out like a sore thumb. We did. We put that album out to me, you know, we top number two album on Heat Seeker. And one of the biggest things or rather what I heard the most was exactly the point it is that you're bringing. They were finally excited about the fact that there were not just people that were living living these principles, but the fact that there were musicians that didn't like hate them, because that's really what ends up happening. A lot of us listen to musicians that will win awards off of your clicks. And then they will tell you how much you suck because you voted the wrong way. But it's a big market. Not just in that. I talk about this every day with the comic books though. There's a huge market. And people are thirsting and thrive. It's a thriving market, man. If you get in there, just throw your hat, give it a shot. Television, the same thing. People are sick to death of giving them money to films they go and watch. And then they see the actors go up and then berate them at the Oscars. They don't want it. So, you know, we have a huge market there. If people want to be brave enough to tap into it. That's true. Makeup too. There's a lot of people who are on the lookout for a conservative makeup brand. I don't know. There may be news on that soon. First, we're going to go to break. First, we want to thank our sponsor Freedom Project Academy. So parents, just in case you're not clear, although if you watch this show, I know that you are clear what your children are being taught in public school. All right. We just discussed that, you know, oh, biological males, totally the same as biological females. No differences there. All white people are racist. By the way, math is racist. You can support Black Lives Matter, social justice. But don't worry about reading and writing. And by the way, thanks to Joe Biden, teachers unions just got tens of billions in COVID catch to push all of this in your public school classrooms. I know you don't want this for your kids. You know how I know you don't want this for your kids? Because you're watching this program. All right. So please consider Freedom Project Academy. Freedom Project Academy, they have perfected live online learning. They've been doing it for over a decade. So they were doing it way before COVID came in. They've already known how to do it. They are built on Judeo-Christian values. They've have a classical curriculum and they are providing mastery of subject matter, not the leftist propaganda. You got to go to freedomforschool.com. Request your free information packet today. Fall semester is around the corner. I know everyone feels like, well, we're about to hit summer and I can wait. Don't sleep on this. All right. Your children's education is at stake. You got to go to freedomprojectacademyatfreedomforschool.com. That is freedomforschool.com. Dr. Anthony Fauci, greatest con man of all time, is set to release a book on COVID and appear in a new Disney backed documentary. Yeah, I know Eric, I think is I'm going to make his head explode one of these days live on the show. The ratings will be through the roof and so will his head. The book is called Expect the Unexpected, 10 Lessons on Truth, Service and the Way Forward. It will be released by National Geographic Books November 2nd. And I, you know, it's just interesting because this guy is already making money off the backs of taxpayers, the highest paid federal employee in the entire country makes more than the president, 417,608 dollars per year as the director, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. And I mean, obviously set to make more money. It's weird though, because I thought that he was supposed to be heading up this whole pandemic, which was like the biggest crisis that the United States has ever seen according to, oh, I don't know, him. And I guess he was just busy like writing a book and making sure that he could profit off of the backs of the Americans whose businesses he destroyed, whose children's lives he destroyed. But I mean, you know, I mean, it's all for, you know, just just a couple dollars. Look, I know I will probably I'm about to go crazy right now. Eric's like, okay, I want the editors. Yeah, I don't want you guys. So I'm gonna try to take take my time here. I think a lot of people were naive. And I think they've conceded this fact when you got to look at guys like Fauci and this whole pandemic deal. And folks would wonder if it's not as bad as what they're saying it is, why on earth would they be acting in the way that they are? I do believe that Fauci is narcissistic, ego, physical enough for him to have one to kick that can continuously down the road because it put him in a spotlight. And now he's getting things like this. It's not just the book deals. We've seen him on cover of all these magazines. He's he's been paraded around right now. I believe he loves that. He wasn't getting it before. This is a very older guy. He's with 81 or something like that. 80. He's been around for a minute, but he became a household name because of this. Yeah, we know he botched a pandemic. We know all of that. But as far as I'm being like a household name, that was a relatively new thing. He loves that. And that's why he continues like you couldn't turn on TV without him being on it anyway. And you wonder like, Oh, look, he asked me that bad right there. That because why would on earth will he continue to say, it's like, dude, you got to look at what these guys have to gain from keeping this going as long as they go. If the pandemic ended, like almost immediately, say after March the gig, which should have been up, y'all should have known that this was a fraud, he goes away. And nobody's listening to him. Nobody's paying attention to you think he wants that. Of course he doesn't want that. Of course he didn't want that he had a lot to gain. And it was just him. A lot of people had a lot of ways to a lot of things to gain, be able to this stimulus package is the money and stuff that they're being lined. I think with him, he just loved the basking in the fame. And now fortune that he's going to get from kicking this can continuously down the road. Yes, people are that evil and they work for the government. Yeah, I mean, Matt, conflict of interest much. I'm like, uh, hello, you guys want him to continue making decisions on a pandemic that he's profiting from? Well, power is intoxicating. I mean, it really is. And even to go to your point again about talking about him being an narcissist, who in their right mind would announce that they're going to release a book right now. Who would do that? When you think, oh, you know what, I should probably wait a little bit, like get it. I'll get the win, right? Like make sure it's all gone away. No, he's doing it. And we still have fully up with up yet. I mean, you can't make this up. And then they're all the other variants and, oh, yeah, when was his downtime? I don't have enough time to do my own washing. You know, I'm like busy all day and he's sitting right in a book in the midst of this like, really? Yeah, it's incredible. It's also expect the unexpected. I hope lesson number one is just be prepared to take both sides of an issue. That way, nobody ever knows that you've said the wrong thing. Works every time. He is the he if nothing else, he mastered the art of taking multiple sides of the same issue. So he can never be pinned down on being wrong. Although, Eric, although, but don't you think that the media was complicit in that? Oh, I feel like he's he's taking opposite ends of the issue. But if someone would just call him on it, because now that people have been actually pushing back on him, you see the CDC relax all of their guidance. They weren't doing that before the media started pushing back on him. So it's like, gosh, if only we had a media to push back on him from the beginning, maybe he wouldn't have been allowed to do all of that. A lot of moving parts that allow this to get as disastrous as as what it did. And obviously, the media, which are the enemies of the people, had the if not the biggest hand in it. I mean, again, those are the people that he's kind of was appealing to because they put him on TV all the time and was parading him around acting as if he was the absolute beacon of truth. So of course, so yeah, you're right. If people question them and came back and like really grilled him on the subject matters, when he did take both sides of the same issue, well, we wouldn't be in this position, but that would require journalists to actually be journalists. No, we also we have we have a situation where we're creating deities, right? Like this is what's happening year after year now is as I think people are moving away from faith, like any kind of faith, whether you're Christian. So what they're doing now is they need their gods, right? So I've seen you dream of that guy master of hair, cheat, I'm sitting there going, oh, man, this is the most embarrassing thing I've ever seen in my life. It's just horrible. But who would do that? And they're crowning these these idols and they're almost every one of them are bad people. This is the irony of it, right? They're bad people. They're incompetent. They have they have bad intentions, you know. So what I'm interested in is the book, right? Is you going to say, well, you know, I said, you don't need a mask? Then I said, you need a mask. Right. I mean, he has flip flopped on everything. Absolutely. Everything. So be interesting to see if he holds himself accountable. Or if he says how amazing he is all the way through it, right? Yeah, I'm spoiler alert. I've not read the book, but I can promise you that he's going to be amazing the whole way through. Oh, yeah. Beginning, middle, and end. All right, we've got more to come first. We want to thank our sponsor Omaha Steaks. So summer is here. All right. And by the way, Father's Day is around the corner.

The children show blues, clues and you released an LGBTQ themed video on its YouTube channel showing an animated drag queen singing to children. Of course, this is the beginning of Pride Month. So singing about two daddies, two mommies, trans, non-binary and pan family members. This is an animated version of a real life drag queen named Nina West, whom of course today, the today show called a beloved RuPaul Drag Race contestant from season 11. So this this is a song and you know, we can't play it because of copyright reasons. But this is a song about a Pride parade to the tune of the Anzco Marching. And so they're showing all of the you know, the rainbow flags and the lyrics feature all of these LGBTQ buzzwords. Again, children show blues, clues and you. This is definitely what you want your kids watching. If you want to raise them to be like normal, well-adjusted children, except not disregard all of that. It was being completely sarcastic because this is scary out here. Now, I will just say, I know we've got like three minutes, I will just say, as a parent, don't let your kids watch YouTube. Like know what your children are watching. I think that that is an important part of the conversation because you can't let them be indoctrinated by this stuff when we're talking about things that are on the internet, unless you are consenting to them being babysat by it, I guess. But still, they are waiting. They are laying in wait for you to drop your guard and they are going to be there to indoctrinate your children. Well, I came a long way from Blue Skadoo. We can do that. That was part of my child. Yeah. Blue's Clues and what the that is. No, what I just want to say. I'll be very quick here. It's funny back when I guess America became more progressive and more, let's say, rather accepting of different and alternative lifestyles. There are people that warned us that the kids would end up being involved in some of this, let's say, I would argue behavior that they, we should be able to agree. They should have no part of this. And it seems like, you know, obviously back then, they would call this Christian Biggits and all of these sorts of things just being conspiracy theorists. And if you would have asked, I think anybody 10 years ago that we'd be having a discussion whether or not Blue's Clues is f***ed. Excuse my language. Yes. Edit. Edit. Edit. Edit. Out of this. Hello. Blue's Clues is parading around a drag queen as well as discussing castration effectively of kids that age. I think we've, we can see that it wasn't a slippery slope fallacy by any means. Well, we know his parents like they're just not, that's just not something that they should be seeing in this. And here's another point to make is that when you, you have to remember that there's a process before we get to that point, right? You have a person that goes, hey, I know what's a really good idea to have this in a children's show. And then that has to go up the chain, at the studio, right? They all have to agree to it. And then it has to be written, then it has to be directed and the voice I've asked to go on and all that. So it's not just one person, right? So none of us would, we should all agree that this is not a good idea. I mean, my kids are watching Ironman the other day. And there's a part where, and we have to like, you know, there's one little part where they go on the bed and we have to fast forward it. And they were like, ee, dad, baby, so kids are just not interested in that. They shouldn't be anywhere near this stuff. But it's like that thing cuties. Remember the thing? Yes. It has to be greenlit by multiple different people before it gets to us. So it's not just an isolated incident. And that should really concern everyone really about an agenda that is, like you said, we can all agree. I'd like to think that a lot of the people in those communities as well will go out with all the kids. They don't need to be having this. This is a really evil agenda, actually. Yeah, all great points. All right, we got to take a break. We'll be back. Yeah, it's like, I would also not be afraid. Yeah.

Okay, I had a French foreign exchange student come once and we all realized how lazy we were with our words because she would be like, may I have some water? And we were like, yeah, water? Who says what? Oh, I guess that's how it's spelled. You just don't say it. You try and order it drive through. I'll go. Can I have a bottle of water, please? They're like, sorry. You have about water. Water. But those of you who are watching, please make sure you go over to wherever you get your audio podcast. Subscribe, rate and review the news and why it matters.
