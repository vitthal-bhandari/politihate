    "text": " Welcome to this area. I'm Erin Ryan here with my pals, Kieran Deal. Hi! And Megan Galey, what's up? I'm going on airplane mode. Oh good. Dedicated to this. Oh yeah, I know the text from my mom. This week, Kieran Deal and Megan Galey join me to talk about female governors, the sad state of maternity leave, and the surprisingly contentious issue of parades. Then we tackle the pink tax, the week in sorry, and I'll have what she's having. And stay tuned to find out which one of us doesn't believe in astrology. Hint, it's me! First, we're going to do a little housekeeping. Histeria's first live show. First live show! Wow! This Sunday at Outside Lands in San Francisco. We're at 4pm on Sunday. It's going to be me, Megan, and Grace Para who you heard last week and who you will hear this coming week. We're going to be recording it so if you can't make it, you'll hear it. But if you're there, please stop by. We would love to see you. Secondly, I've been getting a lot of tweets and emails from people who want to know who does our theme song and it's Sizzie Rocket, S-I-Z-Z-Y Rocket. She's amazing. You can find her on Spotify and all over the place. And so you can check out the theme song in its entirety on Spotify and other platforms and other stuff that she's done too. She's a really great artist and a little shy and thrown her way. Third announcement, I want to let you guys know that our inboxes have been absolutely flooded with dick pics. I know I said the first time I gave out our email address, Histeria at crooked.com, that don't send us pictures of actual male anatomy, but we would welcome pictures of men named Dick. We've gotten maybe a hundred photos of men named Dick. Just all kinds of dicks, cavitt and dicks, York, dicks, sergeant, Nixon, Cheney, all kinds of dicks. Any unknown dicks? All the dicks were known dicks to me. And there were also some people who kind of stretched the definition. They didn't literally give me a dick. They just gave me a person they would call a dick. So I've gotten a Stephen Miller photo. It's been really, our listeners are just a great bunch of fucking jackass. So thank you for that, for all the dick pics. We're also getting them tweeted at us now, which is a lot of fun. Great. If you want to send us a dick pic or an email or if you want us to bring up something or you know of a woman that's making waves in her industry, you can reach us at Histeria at crooked.com. I try to read every email. We get a lot of them. Sometimes I forget for a few days and then I look at the inbox and I'm like, ah, and I close it. But send us emails. We try to read all of them. And we love hearing from you. Now I want to move on to the news. There was some special elections yesterday, Kansas, Chris Kobach, who in June was told by a judge that he needed to go back to law school. He was literally ordered to complete, I believe six weeks of additional legal training because he was so bad at arguing a case. Anyway, he's going to be the Republican candidate for governor in Kansas now. So that's fun. That's fun. His entire legal career has been him spectacularly losing cases where he argued the most xenophobic possible position. Well, and he's one of those guys that's kind of in Trump's circle who looks like his hair has been done by a tiny lawnmower. And not that how your hair looks matters, but it does if I hate you. It also does if you have enough money to run for governor. Yeah. Get your shit together. Yeah. Right. Seriously. But you know what? Take a page out of one of these extramarital affair people. Yeah. And put some money into your looks. Into your appearance. Put some money in your, I've extramarital affair people. We were referring to Rick Gates, I believe. He doesn't look like he spends any money on his opinion. That's a good point. Rick Gates, Paul Manafort's deputy admitted yesterday that he spent $3 million on an affair. Hell yeah, girl. I love the way it was like, I would need five. I would need five. Have you seen that man? Yeah. Yeah, that's true. So there's that. But here's a couple of things that happened yesterday. Democrats lost in Ohio by a razor sharp margin, but an Al Zunil. It's still, I heard today, the Republicans have been like, we're claiming victory, but there's still 8,000 right ins and provisional ballots that haven't been counted. Right. So it could be Mickey Mouse that won. Yeah, it could be. What was the margin, do you know? This morning, I heard on NPR that it was 1,750 votes, which was like 0.9 percent, I believe, which means, I think in in in Ohio, a 0.5 percent difference triggers an automatic recount. So when these other votes come in, there's a bunch of stuff to change. But, you know, regardless that the vote is a lot closer than Republicans wanted, also a right to work law got struck down by voters in Missouri. That's cool. Here's another quick thing though about elections yesterday and moving into the fall because we are God so close in the midterms, so close to the midterms. If you're not registered to vote, you need to register immediately. And because I guess what happened yesterday is a great example. Like, it could be this close. Yeah, it could be this close where you live, even if you think you live in a deep red state. But here's a cool thing. Hold on to your butts. Wave of female governors could be coming in the fall. There are, an ABC show. Hold on to your butts. Female governors coming this fall. Yeah, it's sort of like, remember in the 80s when there was a whole genre of what a man caring for a baby. How funny. Yeah. Like, that's going to be the new like the the 20 teen genre of that's crazy. A woman governor. This is true in 1980 as of 1985 states had only five states that had female governors ever. And that's as of 1980. Nearly half of the states still have not yet had a female governor. And it's 2018. People who were born in 1980 are like, it's gross. Six states currently have female governors. So six out of 50. That is not great. And there have only been 39 female governors in US history. It's crazy that like New York, California and Florida, because those are the three with the biggest electoral, like just the biggest electoral college votes for the presidency. Like none of those three have had female governor. Yeah. That's like a little that that made me feel a little poopy diaper, not gonna lie. Yeah. That's a little poopy diaper. That's because it's like, New York, California, come on. What are we doing? These coastal elites. That's what I mean. It's like, we're letting our we're letting ourselves down. Yeah, it's a weird circumstance. The New York Times piece about this suggested that because women are often viewed as more likely to compromise and get along that they are more likely to be successful running for like legislative positions or for Senate. And governors are viewed as sort of like the state boss. And so people are voting for men because they believe men are better bosses, even though we're in a me to era where we've established that men are not better bosses, but regardless. So here's some women that are running for Governor Janet Mills, Stacey Abrams in Georgia, Paulette Jordan in Idaho, who if she won would be the first ever elected Native American governor, which is very cool. Christy Noem, who's a Republican in South Dakota last night, Gretchen Whitmer won her primary in Michigan. There are women running to run for governor in so they're running in primaries in Wisconsin and Minnesota. Also super interesting. So that's you know, that's kind of like, sad, aggressive, I guess. Yeah, yeah, I really wanted when you announced each of those names, I really wanted to hear like, boop boop boop boop like after each one and then like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. Janet Mills, Janet Mills. You know what I mean? That's what I was. The female governors as the Harlem Globe Trotters. That's right. Yeah. Next and against the Washington Generals. Yeah. Literally. Next time I'll let you do it, Karen. Right. The rest of the podcast actually should just be dedicated to these names and just saying them over and over again. That would be so avant-garde. Great. Meanwhile, there's another piece in the New York Times about how a lot of men who have been accused of sexual harassment are just running for office anyway. Why not? Go get it. I just want to have the confidence. I just want to have the confidence of a mediocre asshole sexual harassment. Well, because you there must be a conversation too of like, okay, well, we got to figure this out. What you did, we feel like you can still do it. You know, like, you grabbed a couple boo. Yeah, she said a couple things. She said a couple pictures. Yeah. Yeah. Go for it. Trump has let us dream big in that way. He really has. He's really, yeah, he's opened up a lot. And I really have appreciated that of all the inconsistencies in his policies, in his public statements, in what his press shop says, he has always fallen on the side of sexual harassers. You know, Roy Moore, he, when Missouri's governor was accused of one of the most egregiously awful cases of like sexual harassment, where it's like, you shouldn't be working anywhere, much less being governor of anything. Yeah, Donald Trump has really stood up for sexual harassers. When, what was it, Rob Porter, his former staffer, who couldn't get security clearance because he was alleged to have abused two of his wives, Donald Trump stood up for him. It's just, you know, that's his moral consistency. It's really one of the very few bipartisan things that, you know, it's like our dicks bring us together. It reaches across the aisle that dick does. It really does. That foot tap goes across the aisle. Yeah. Oh, man. Hand on the knee across the aisle. That hand on the knee is just like from Democrat to Republican. It's like, you're my aid, you're my intern, but it just doesn't matter. Yeah, donkeys, elephants, they all do it. Yeah, one of the things that I've been thinking about is, yeah, it just seems like a lot of people, a lot of men seek power because they feel like it gets them access to sex, to sex from women who maybe wouldn't give them attention otherwise. And so, now that that's being called into question, they're really rejecting that. They're like, well, I didn't even fucking do this. You know, good. Like, if I can't even, but can't even, it's like, if I got a job and they were like, here is, here's your paycheck. You can't spend it on rent. I'd be like, well, why, why are they good at job? You know? And I think that, I don't know, it just seems like that that's part of the psychology of people who like violently reject this sort of thing. I think that means we'll see less of them running, hopefully then. More of them as strip club DJs. I'm not saying you're all, but actually, I would trust a strip club DJ to protect me more than a congressman. Oh, for sure. I'd rather have you walk me to my car. I think strip club DJs probably know exactly when something is taking a turn and can like, let someone know. Probably have some of the highest levels of integrity out of all the professions, if we're being honored. They're just there for the music, truly, at the end of the day. It's about the love. It is. The love of the beats, the love and the music. I wanted to add one more thing. How, why are, why are women, you don't look, I'm talking, well, most of the people listening to this are probably women, but you're beautiful. You do not need to sleep with Rick Gates or Paul Manafort or Donald Trump or the guy Brady who allegedly impregnated the Playboy Playmate. You're worthwhile. You were worth more than these jowly, chinless suits. Don't sleep with these people. I don't care if they're getting uni-sotels. We need to unionize women. We need to unionize and declare- Get ourselves hotels. Yeah, get ourselves hotels. Have a giant sleep over in the penthouse. Watch a party girl with Parker Posey. So just kind of to close the thing about the elections yesterday. I don't like horse race journalism and I don't like talking about it. Like, oh, and this, what does this thing in Ohio mean for Republicans in Oregon? Like, it doesn't mean dick. Every place is different. But what it does show is that there are places that are deeply Republican that are in deep shit now if you're a Republican because there's been a huge blue swing. But at the same time, you know, moral victories don't matter if we're not actually winning, winning. So I don't want people to let go of, I mean, this is going to sound very like Batman villain, but like, don't let go of the memory of how fearful you were on the day after Election Day 2016. Like, hold onto that as you're working on toward 2018. Let that fire burn inside. Yeah, embrace the fear. I heard them that before. One more news story before we move on to our deep dive this week. The FMLA, which does not stand for the fuck my life act. It stands for the Family Medical Leave Act. It's 25 years old this year. Okay. FMLA is the pathetic excuse for parental leave that we have in this country before that we had nothing. But this guarantees 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a new baby or I believe a sick relative. So we're one of, I think, three or four countries in the world. We're in the company of, I believe, like, Papua New Guinea. Like, it's just countries that maybe aren't as economically advanced or global as we are. And we still don't have any paid paternal leave and it's very pathetic. But luckily, luckily feminist heroes Marco Rubio and Ivanka Trump have a great idea. Nope. I was thinking about it. Yeah, that's better. That's like a disco siren thing, but it like descends. So it's like sad. Everybody. The horn gets broken. Sad, aggressive strip club DJ music. So Marco Rubio's new plan would let people use the retirement money if they want to take paid parental leave. So basically, if you have a baby and you want to take paid leave, you can, but you have to retire six weeks later, which is laughing because it is so hard to curse that kid for those six weeks, too. Like, you know, I want to be the fuck out of here. That's also like, oh, God, the only way you can beat the system is if you die early. Hell yeah. I mean, you need to have like six kids and then it's like six, six to 44 children. Take all the leave from your social security and then like die before you retire, but like real early. Yeah. Well, luckily stress contributes to mortality. So the stress of having to work until you're 80 years old might just kill you anyway before you have to worry about declaring bankruptcy as an elderly person, which there is another, there's a piece I swear, I read things besides the New York Times, but there was another piece in the New York Times about old people having to declare bankruptcy, which is a growing demographic and people should be worried. But I used to work at a continuing care retirement community. So that's you can come in at any age and health. And then if you buy into it, you go through, you can go up to all the way to 24 hour care. And we had people that had to move out because they ran out of money. And there's nothing sadder than seeing an elderly person wheeled out of the nursing home they're in to be going to a worse nursing home that they don't want to be in. And it's, I mean, there was a quote from Marco Rubio in this that it's so funny because even when he's trying to be like, good, he still is an asshole. He was like caring for a sick loved one shouldn't bankrupt you. No medical issues should bankrupt you. If you fall ill, you shouldn't be bankrupt. If anything, if you're gonna fucking car accident, you bang your head too hard and you can't go to work, you shouldn't. Nothing. Nothing medical related should bankrupt you in any way. And so it to me, this is like, they're touching on like a tip of the iceberg that it's like, yeah, this should have already fucking happened. Right. You know, the fact that this FMLA, the Marco Rubio of on control plan, which to be fair has not been it hasn't been prioritized by the house. This is clearly just a PR move. So people are like, yeah, I did something. It's like when you if you're if you're ever out like in a in a group eating situation or you're out with a friend and you offer to pick up the check and they like make the least good, like pretend move for the wallet ever. My dad calls it crocodile arms. Yeah. Right. But they're crocodile arming like increasing access to family leave here because I don't think Marco Rubio really wants to fix it because this the Republican Party hasn't prioritized fixing this. The the unpaid maternity I had a bunch of friends who had kids like I had six friends have babies like within the last like eight months and it's like you your body physically like it's like there is a physical repair process that needs to happen. You know what I mean? Like when you when you have a child, it's like they're all wearing diapers. They're all like they have stitches. Do you know what I mean? Stuff is leaking out of extra orifices. Real sexy stuff. But Eile Wong has a lot of great material. Yeah, she does. And it's like but if you the fact that there is no coverage for us as a country, like there's no onus on on our nation is it's and most most husbands go back to work like I remember calling a friend and being like, where's Matt? And she's like, oh, Matt's gone. Like Matt's at the office. I'm like, no, no, no, no, you can't be no, no, no, no, no, no, no, this was I signed up to be a friend of this baby because I thought two of you were going to be doing this deal together. Right. And it's like a new life. There's Excel spreadsheets that need to be filled out. You know, so it's like, but it's also like if you take a look at who is who is making the laws and this goes back to the first point about how just as a microcosm of the problem, there have only been 39 female governors and I think we're still only 20% of the house in the Senate and that is the highest percentage women have ever been. Like it is clear that people are making laws have no idea how women's bodies work, nor do they have any curiosity about how women's bodies work. It almost seems like they have an aversion to finding out what women's needs are, what the needs of mothers are, what the needs of families are, because what they would like to do is kind of be that I think the Congress is if it were a person, it would be a 50s dad smoking a cigar in the waiting room while his wife was in labor. And the other thing you can't forget is that all of those people are quite wealthy as far as the standards go. So it's like, because a lot of senators, a lot of people in government do have children, they have wives and they have children, but it's like it doesn't affect them to the same level because they have money. Like, and when you have money or like your wife doesn't have to work for that time, it kind of it's like, like it doesn't affect you. Right. You know, a lot of people who are wealthy, this isn't a dirty little secret because I don't think it's bad for people to acknowledge that it's easier to raise children if you have help, but a lot of wealthy people, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, for example, Kelly and Conway, Ivanka Trump, they all have nannies. They all have people that are usually women of lower economic echelons that they pay, you know, hopefully a living wage, but not always to take care of their children. And a lot of wealthy people do that. A lot of people are like, oh, I can't imagine how we would get along without a nanny. And it's like there are two parents, there's two kids and also a nanny. So the adults outnumber the children and the parents are still raising kids as exhausting. And there's a night nurse too. I love the one was like, who are your friends, Aaron? Wow. I mean, I've got a lot of friends. I had a friend, she was like, I have a night nurse. And and she goes, it's a southern thing. And my mom goes, it's a rich thing. Your mom sounds awesome. Bring her in. She's pretty fun. We're really getting to know the gay ladies. I know. I'm the dad, the crocodile arms. I had a therapist tell me I loved my family too much. I always say that the American dream is to have, you know, as an immigrant, it's to have other immigrants raise your children for you. Never see your kids. That's right. That's the American dream. And I always like to say it's white immigrants. I want to have white immigrants raise my children. I've really made it. That's what I mean. Karen, a lot of times when we're discussing FMLA family leave maternity leave, paternity leave, we hear people say like, well, at least it's something. So there's a well, at least it's something argument for the this sort of a thing too, right? Yeah, I thought that was really interesting. There's an article in the Washington Examiner by Patrice Lee and Wuka. I hope I'm saying that right. And I thought it was it's like cynical, but it was very practical. And she was talking about black mothers. And it was she's essentially saying it's like, yes, it's not a good option to have to take, you know, social security and then put that forward into your maternity leave. But it is a thing that could get passed potentially because it doesn't add payroll taxes. It's not going to be a wage garnish for everyone that would have to be passed in the House in the Senate. So that's nobody wants to pass tax bills. Do you know what I mean? Like essentially, I mean, we can cut taxes for the rich, right? But like we definitely can't raise taxes just tiny amounts where you get that night nurse money for the moms. Yeah, that's true. I do need night nurse money. Were you going to get that night nurse money? Yeah, exactly. So I mean, I did think that I thought that was interesting that she was like, you know, if you're making $30,000 a year and you're able to borrow from yourself at $4,000 a year and you can make the case in a kind of really swampy, mired kind of political system that we have. And you can kind of make the case and say, listen, nobody's taxes are going to go up. This is kind of no harm, no foul. People are just borrowing from themselves. It would be a thing that would kind of be a good stopgap for a lot of people so that they don't have to go on government assistance, you know, kind of get them back to work, whatever. And so for vulnerable populations, I just thought it almost like the argument came out of the cynicism that it's going to take a lot longer to pass something that would be better. That's correct. I mean, I think there's a lot to think about here and it's something but it's also clear that what we have is bad and that the FMLA is 25 years old and we haven't come up with anything better. That fucking sucks. That really sucks. Anyway, we have to take a break. When we come back, we're going to take a deep dive into the pink tacks. And we're back. We're going to talk a little bit about the pink tacks and our deep dive this week. Pink tacks is how women's products are often made smaller and more expensive and that manifests as a tax that we physically have to pay on maintaining ourselves or looking okay enough to leave the house. The reason I'm thinking about this is there was a piece in the New York Times op-ed page this past weekend written by a woman who is talking about waiting in line for free lipsticks from Mac, which are like $18, I think. It's been a long time since I bought a lipstick from us. 18 something plus tax. And these women were waiting in line for like an hour for a free lipstick. Yeah, is your time worth 18, 15 hour? Would you more, I think she waited more? Well, yeah. If she hit an hour, then she was like, even in it, which is sort of like the place I come from too, is like, yeah, there's camaraderie. You make friends, you know, like you're around like minded women. Yeah. Well, there's, I mean, that's something that she wrote in this piece about how capitalism makes women the losers because the things that we buy are mostly expensive. And then there's products that we purchase that men don't have to worry about purchasing. And so, you know, one of the, one of the things she points out is they don't make like men's lipstick or anything like that. So that was something that I was thinking about. I was also thinking about, you know, the amount of time that we have to spend getting ready every day to look okay to leave the house. I work in a writer's room and my male coworkers are super nice guys, but I can tell most of the time it took them maybe 10 minutes to get ready. And my female coworkers maybe 45 minutes. And when you add all that together, it's like, how much time do you spend a year looking at yourself in the mirror and painting your own face? You know, I don't know. So this is something that I've been thinking about a lot. And I also was thinking about this because there is a trailer for a new movie that just hit Twitter this week called Napoli Ever After. And it's about a Black woman's relationship with her hair, which is something that you don't often see depicted in pop culture. It's kind of something that, but you know, in the trailer, she's the main character says that her hair has become like a second job for her. Karen, I wonder what you think about the way that beauty standards affect specifically women of color and the way that the pink tacks maybe more disproportionately affects women of color. I mean, the thing that struck me about this is like, if you are earning less already, and then you have to spend more on products, it's like, that's like, you're, it's like a double negative. It's like a double loss for you, which is like super, super shitty. But there's also like this thing with looking good, because you were like, how much time? And I know there's like this idea that, oh, I can just like opt out of that thing. But think about like, when you like, I had a friend one time and I like, I love this example. She like goes to the bank. She goes to her bank, right? And it's like, and sometimes she goes looking like a homeless person. You know what I mean? Just like, you know, wearing her garbage bag of an outfit and like, you know, make up on whatever goes like dressed up one time, like maybe coming from work or whatever gets treated like a different person, like the same people be like, Oh, hello, ma'am. What would you like a place in the law? Like, Oh, yeah, here's exactly. It's just like, you're the same person, but like, you do get treated differently. And I'm sure a lot of people listening to this podcast can attest to this. Like, when you look nicer, when you when you just look better, people are nicer to you. And that has social and cultural capital. Like, I know for myself, it's like, it's like growing up like, as like a very hairy person, this is a problem that a lot of like Indian people have like on the plus side can sell my hair for rent money. But like, you know, on the minus side, it's like just the amount of time you spent waxing your legs going to electrolysis, like all that shit. It's very expensive. And it's like, technically, could you just like not do any of that? Sure. But then you're like, not going to want to wear shorts or a skirt or like participate in this way. Like, you know what I mean? Like in the culture, because it's like, we're like, I know you can make that stance, but then it becomes like a stance. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like, you're doing something outside of the norm. And then that's going to take time, effort, energy, you're going to, you know, it's going to be a whole thing. Yeah. And maybe you just want to put your fucking time into other shit, you know? Yeah. I mean, it's kind of self-repetuating though, because it's, we all opt in. We're all like, okay, well, this is how we have to look in order to be accepted. And so we continue to do it. And so it becomes a thing that we all have to continue to do. This is another reason we need to unionize guys. We need to be like, okay, this is an okay thing for us to do because it makes us feel better about ourselves and it doesn't take much time or money. This is a thing we're not going to do anymore. And you know, Karen, your point about if you choose to not participate in a certain way, then it becomes your thing. There have been times when I've, but you know, I've lived in like liberal enclaves for my entire adulthood. And even still, if I'm like at a concert, at a bar, whatever, hang out with a friend, and I look down and I see that she just like hasn't shaved her legs. Like just is a woman who doesn't shave her legs. It always is like, ah, like for a second, I have this like little second of like, oh, she doesn't shave her legs. And it's a thing that I, I wish it's a thing that I didn't notice. I wish it was something that women could choose to do or not, or not do and have it be fine. But even for me, somebody who spends a lot of time thinking about things that women are, are expected to do or ways are expected to spend their time and money and energy, that's something that I noticed. And it's like, oh, fuck, I've got it. It's ingrained. It's stuck in me, you know? I love hair and makeup. I really do. And which hair, the leg hair, the head hair, all the hair, I really hate it. In that sense of like, you know, when I was a baby, I probably like held a hairbrush and those things. And I think that's sort of at the core of what feminine is. Do I wish I could spend less money on it? Absolutely. I don't know if I would stop doing it though, because I do find such great joy. I'm in a Facebook beauty group. It's the only reason I go on Facebook is to just like talk to people, see their pictures. It's all female comedians too. And it's never, it's the one Facebook group I've been with. That's all women that hasn't been shut down. Someone has like shared a secret or been like, he did, but you know, like, we all are just truly focused on makeup. And I find so much joy in it. But I have started not wearing makeup on stage because I like to give my face a day off. And it's something that when I do it, I always bring it up on stage. I'm because it's like, I want you to know that I'm not usually like that. Like, I'm almost apologizing for it. And it's like, Oh, I wish it was just okay to do it and not have to address it in any way. But it is something I really do take joy from. But then I hear you and I'm like, yeah, but I remember the first, I remember begging to get my makeup done for the first Bob Mitzvah I was going to, you know, and then I was like rushing to leave the house and my mom was like, where's your lipstick? And so I like went back and put my lipstick on because we had bought it. And I think that's it too. It's like, oh, we own all this shit. We might as well use it. Yeah. One time that actually reminded me Megan one time I was in the makeup chair at CNN. And I showed up, I normally wear like bright red lipstick when I'm on TV because I started doing it and then I just couldn't stop doing it because every time I would go, the makeup people would be like, yay, it's your signature. So I showed up one day and I wasn't already wearing my red lipstick. And they were like, where's your lipstick? And I was like, oh, I have it. I'll just put it on when you're done. And they were like, okay, okay, good. Because red lipstick is kind of your signature. And I was like, I would like to think that the way that I processed the news and speak about it would be my signature. Absolutely not. No, no, no, no, no, the word I would think it's the words coming out of my mouth. No, it's just your mouth. But I've been here for your mouth. I've been sitting in a makeup chair and they were doing nothing to me. And this hair and makeup people on set are the best people. And I've seen people be mean to them. And I'm like, I hope you never fucking get hired to do anything again. If you're rude to the people there to make you look good, you're a monster. Yeah, a great side note. And she wasn't doing anything to me. And then I was like, can I get a lash? And she goes, oh, we have a last girl, because since I'm a comedian, they don't think I want glam. And I'm like, glam it up, bitch, you're trained. I want this. And so it is sort of like we're individuals. We're all allowed to approach our appearance differently on any given day. I think one thing that the women union I was still gonna harp on that. We needed to really to brainstorm a name for that in in advance. Yeah, the Womian. The Womian? No, I don't want to be exclusive. Anyway, we'll figure something out. We'll workshop it. I think one of the things that Megan, you're touching on is, you know, I think it's hard sometimes when you're trying to just like live your life in public to not see other people's aesthetic choices as pressure to also make those choices. And I think that you're right that it's like, it's totally fine if somebody else wants to look a certain way, as long as they're okay with me making a different choice. But it's hard to convey that without going up to someone and be like, your choices are fine, which is a creepy thing to say to anybody at any point, especially if they're not somebody that you know. The fact that you would wear like a pink lip or like a nude lip and other people would be disappointed is kind of insane. Yeah, it is kind of insane. Another thing I was thinking about is about like how the pink tax affects you if you try to be an ethical consumer. And by ethical consumer, I mean, if you try to use makeup brands that pay their employees fairly, if they don't test on animals, if they use ingredients that are not bad. Yeah, yeah, or not even toxic, just ingredients that are tested and that are known to be disposed of waste in a ethical manner to right, it costs that costs money. Yeah, I want to just say one more thing. It's like, I will say that I feel pressure to look a certain way. Like if I have to be like photographed or if it's like, I mean, I have a friend who gave me hundreds of dollars worth of beautiful free makeup, but I'm like 45 fucking minutes to put this shit on my face with like a journal entry of like, where to put the shit in you're supposed to watch a YouTube fuck you. Do you know what I mean? Like, fuck, I want to do this. I get shit to do. I want to wear pajamas. I wouldn't be like, like people to know me well enough that I can show up in a garbage bag and they're still like happy to see you, but it's like that status. Yeah, like you have to get to a place like, especially in an industry like this one where you can do that and where you can get away with that. Like, I don't really feel like it's an actual choice to shave my legs. Like, I know it is a choice, but I do think that there is social capital. I do think that you're you are gaining something when you wear a nice blouse to a place or you look a certain way. It really changes how you get to navigate through space and it can, you know, like it can help you to come over the hump of maybe some things that might be seen as categorical disadvantages. So, you know what I mean? Like, it's the whole thing with like hoodies. You know, if you wear a hoodie and you're like versus a business suit, you know, and you're a person of color or whatever and how you might be perceived when you're walking down the street and then the money associated with putting that in. It's like, maybe, I think in a perfect world, yes, we all should like look good and we should get to like wear what we want to wear and like and do our makeup how we want to do it. But I, I'm going to guess that and either either I'm like the one person on an island out on a limb, you know, with this one. But like, I think a lot of people probably do feel like a social pressure to, to look a certain way. And I say this wearing no makeup. I'm like, yeah, I got to get glammed up. I'm in pajamas. Right. And it's like, I love the words like, yeah, I see your social pressure with your ponytail and no makeup. And I was like, it's a podcast, Aaron. This is a different situation. But with women, when I know I'm going to be with all women and people are like, you dress for the woman sometimes, but sometimes I'm like, if I'm going to hang out with just friends, I'm not wearing makeup. I'm not doing my hair. I'm not doing any of that. And even if I was going to hang out with men, it's like, I have a boyfriend, they're not going to fuck me. You know, but like, I still am just more comfortable in my own skin, barefaced, wearing whatever I want to when I'm in a group of just women. Yeah. And I think Karen touched on something really interesting that being able to choose when it comes to this is kind of a luxury. The more status you have, the more money you have, the more privilege you have just based on the way that you look, your race, your social class, whatever, the more you can opt out. I've been to comedy shows where I've seen famous female stand-up show up with just a messy bun on their head and in pajamas testing out some new material, right? Killing it. But if a new stand-up did that, I would be like, she's a mess. Yeah, what's going on with her? So this obviously isn't the most important thing in the world, but it's something that women think about every day. It's one of those little invisible pockets. And I will say, I've been doing my makeup the same way since I was 16 years old. Oh, wow. So I could basically do it sleepwalking. I can do a cat eye. Yeah. You have a perfect cat eye. Thank you. At 745 A. Yeah, I know. I mean, I noticed that. I'm like, Aaron's got her shit together. But I've been doing it the same way for a long time. And I use the time that I put on makeup every day. I use the time that I get ready to listen to educational podcasts. Because I'm like, I have this time that for whatever reason, I have to sit looking at myself in the mirror and painting my face because this is how I feel normal going through the world. And so I'll listen to like, Pod save the world sometimes. I mean, but you still use the word have to. Yeah. And I mean, like half you didn't say like, Oh, because I like want to. I would say I feel pressure sometimes. I will do car makeup. I will say that's the one thing about Los Angeles. And then I feel like, I'm multitasking. Yeah. I'm like doing it at the stoplight. And then it's like, woman on the go. That's right. If I have a long drive, normally I go into the car with no makeup on and then and then I bring it and then I'm like, Oh, I'm getting so much done. You are a dangerous. Yeah. I live on the edge. You know what I mean? I'm drinking my coffee. I'm doing makeup. I'm drawing the car. Curl ash curl. Lash on the car. But I will do mascara. Like I'll do mascara. I'll do a full face of makeup while I drive. I used to love watching women on the subway in New York, but on makeup. I am impressed. I've done it on the subway and it has not turned out perfect on a commute on a commute. I can do it with no mirror. Whoa. I know guys. That's pretty good. That's pretty good. So I think that's about all the time we have to talk about this today. I'm sure it's going to be something that comes up again. We didn't get into the kind of canow worms of ethical consumption, which is something that we're definitely going to talk about more in the future, just because this is something we all think about every day regardless of how we opt in or out. So you'll hear more about this, but we have to take a break when we come back the week in sorry. Hysteria is brought to you by Quip. The truth is finally the truth. We've arrived. We finally got to the truth. The truth is that most of us are brushing our teeth wrong for not long enough and for getting to change our brush on time. I have heard that. I have heard that and I've thought about it. I'll sometimes go up to this thing at night when I'm not in a position at all to buy a new toothbrush and look at it and think you're gross. Yeah. I'm a big teeth person. Yeah. I mean, my teeth are fine, but God knows for how long. I don't even think mine are fine, but I'm dedicated to them. Well, so is Quip.

To learn more, enjoy the movement, go to unstoppablenow.org. That's unstoppablenow.org. And we're back with the weekend. Sorry. As women, we apologize too much, which is something that I'm really sorry about. But because of that, because of that, really got me. Because of that, we're experts at it, right? Like I've been doing a cat eye since I was 16 years old. I've also been apologizing since for as long as I can remember. So I can tell, and I'm sure you both can as well, when an apology is when it's sincere, when it is sufficient, and whether or not they deserve forgiveness. So we're going to go through a couple of people who either did apologize or should apologize and assess their value as human beings. And judge them. And judge them harshly. Judge them harshly because we're also judged all the time. So fuck, it's our turn. Okay, Megan, go ahead. I know your judgment on this one in particular is not going to be great. This is an apology that should come and never will. So do not stay up holding your breath waiting for this. I combined two metaphors there. Also got that from my mama. LeBron James opened a school last week, a public school in the Akron school district. Incredible. He was interviewed on CNN Friday night. Afterwards, Trump tweeted LeBron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, he made LeBron look smart, which isn't easy to do. I like Mike. The mic he's referring to is Michael Jordan. I thought it was Mike Pence. No, that would be fun. If you just ended his senses. I like Mike Mike and you're like Pence wrote that one. Okay. All right. So he does have the password. This is in a this adds another example to a long history Trump has of attacking black athletes. Trump and LeBron have a little history. LeBron tweeted at him, you bum, which I still think is tweet the best thing you could say to him when the warriors declined going to the White House. So the Cavs had just been beaten by the warriors at this point. And LeBron still came to Steph Curry's defense when Trump said I rescind the invitation anyways. He has called NFL player sons of bitches. He's obviously very opposed to the kneeling in that sense. I think it absolutely has to do with the race. I think that's a very, very disturbing like trend that we've seen. He's he's like low IQ on massing water. He's it's very much attacking their intelligence. I also think Trump really hates these athletes because they're beloved too. Yeah. These are people that actually get parades. And we know this motherfucker loves parades. And there's everyone loves. I know but him especially. I don't think I do love a parade. I don't either. If I was in a parade, I would be nice. No, we're going partisan on the parade. No, no, no, no, it's crazy because I would be thinking this is a lot of waste of money. I don't really want to be here. But we don't think I should be sitting on top of a convertible. That doesn't seem safe. Wow. Wow. The family is more conservative than I thought. A lot. Well, I, you know, I see a lot of JFK playing in my head. You know, the only parade you're seeing is like bad for a horse parade ever. Liberals get shot. That's what happens to praise. Exactly. No, confetti guns and like a confetti gloaties and people with pop corn and you know. Oh, man. So my boss, it always sunny attended the Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl parade and he had some pretty funny stories. Oh, yeah. An Eagles fan ate horseshit off the ground. And that's the type of loyalty Trump is looking for. You know, he's like, oh, people like athletes. They don't like politicians. I truly think if he could like go back in time and try and be an NFL quarterback, he would want to do that. Yeah, but that would require him X or so. Of course. But he would be like, can you do it in a golf cart? Can you just golf? Can you drop back to pass like in a golf cart in reverse? Because then he would probably do it. Just hold the ball and then drive the cart across the field. If he's found a way to be president, I think he could find a way to be an NFL quarterback. I really, sadly, believe that's his like dream when he sees like the love that they have. It was also announced yesterday that LeBron has team was showtime. They're going to do a three part docu series called Shut Up and Dribble, which is a quote Laura Ingram said about specifically LeBron stick to basketball. We don't need you. And I do think of all the terrible things that are coming out of this presidency. One amazing thing is that athletes and people in positions of power in that sense and the public eye are stepping up and becoming activists in a way that is so refreshing and amazing. The school that he opened, he went to the Akron School District and said, what do you need? And then poured only his own money into making that possible. And it's just something so unprecedented and is unfathomable to come from a politician in any way. Yeah, nothing but respect for my president, LeBron James. So obviously Donald Trump should apologize, but he's not going to. No, Michael Jordan's sort of was like my my my my three sentences. My theory on because people have been like Jordan voted for Trump. No, Jordan didn't vote. Jordan's not a voter. Will you get to a certain level of rich when you truly don't care about and I'm not saying anything that some people think he got his dad murdered. Okay, so there's theories out there. The phrase is like everybody buys sneakers. Yeah. So apology, which is never coming would probably not be accepted anyway. Right? You bomb. You bomb. All right, Karen, what do you got? Who's sorry this week? So there was a Japanese medical school, which was apologizing for keeping women out that came out this week. It was an article that NPR ran about a Tokyo medical school that was actually changing test scores of women. So the original, the number of women being admitted in 2010 was 40%. And then they were deducting points and then through the first round and then adding points to certain men so that men would get in so that they could keep the number around 30%. And this was going on for years. They found out because essentially there was like one kid who whose parents, you know, like nepotism, like a pure nepotism case where it was like one kid got in and you know, they gave a ton of money and then a cushioner their way in. That's right. They cushionered their way in and then they and then the authorities kind of took over and were like, oh, actually, he's done. He's very dumb. And there's a ton more corruption than we thought there was. That's a oh, this is a this is a mess. And so the apology, it's like this and this is terrible and unconscionable. And Japan actually has one of the lowest rates of female doctors in the developed world. Like so it's already like a systemic issue. So I don't know if there's an apology that you can give that would be big enough for that, especially when you consider like the Atlanta grand article and like how female doctors are better at treating heart attacks than male doctors, especially in female patients. And I know that's going to be something that we'll get into in another episode. But what I did appreciate is that he sounded really sorry in his apology. It was like he goes he goes into a deep bow. There was a deep bow and he expressed deep regret. And I was like, there's something I really like about the idea of when you're sorry to like bow deeply like like not just not just at a 45 degree angle, but I'm imagine like a full 90 like half a yoga pose. You got a stretch. Yeah, that's what I mean. It's like so so at least there was like the trappings of like, oh, I look really, really sorry. Why they didn't want win like because there's always been that like, well, they're distracting. And no, there's a thing about chill later, they're going to get out of the workforce because they're going to be moms and and children. So it's going to kind of be a waste of money and education. I do think it's interesting that like I will say it's like all of the corruption and the nepotism. I mean, it is it's really honestly, it's a societal loss. Like it's I don't again, I don't know if like you can say I'm sorry and you can sound really genuine, but it's like man, water under the bridge man. It's like people have yeah, it's like it's this is people's lives. You know, I mean, if there's one place where you really want the best people to be, you know, like to be in charge, it's medicine. Like, who do you want treating you at a hospital? The guy who's like the guy who's there because he earned it. The guy or girl who earned it or is it because you know, their parents, you know, bought the school a fridge? You know what I mean? Like, who do you want? You know, like that's the yeah, I literally had a cousin in India who was like, that's how you get good grades in India. You buy because you buy the teacher fridge. Oh, God. Yeah. Well, so you know, if you have Dr. Frigidaire, when you go to the doctor that you're in trouble. Yeah. All right. Well, that's those are the Sari's recovering this week. We have to take a quick break when we come back. I'll have what she's having and the Hill will die on this week. We'll be back. And we're back with I'll have what she's having. This is where we recommend things that women have made, women have done or women that just inspire us that are this week, not necessarily new, but just, you know, stuff. So mine is I am reading Parker Posey's new book. And by reading it, I mean, I'm listening to it on Audible and this isn't an ad for Audible. I'm just like, I just have Audible. But she reads the audio version of her book. So you get to hear her voice do this kind of kooky framing of like her memoirs called You're on an airplane. And so it's she frames it as like she's reading it to you like she's saying it to you and you're sitting next to her on an airplane. And she does stuff like ask for a Diet Coke and like you hear the sound of like ice cubes and a glass. And she talks about her career and her life in Texas. And it's just really wonderful. And if you're a fan of Parker Posey, you'd be a fan of the book. She's just she's great in the books. Great. Megan, what do you got? So mine is a lady named Latanya Pinkard. She is featured on a Netflix series right now called Last Chance You. It's in its third season. The first two seasons were at a different school. Now this is the third season new school. She is an English teacher at a junior college who is probably the most incredible, inspiring teacher that I've ever seen like documented on film. She's an African American woman. Most of the students are African American and she just oh bringing like line backers to tears is what's happening. If you don't want to invest in watching The Full Show, there was a sports illustrated article that came out July 26th that profiles just her. And she's just incredible. And she really she gives you great hope. And she's a woman serving a lot of different looks. Oh, it sounds great. Karen, what's your recommendation? Mine was in the comedy lineup, which is Netflix's 15 minute specials. Michelle Buto is the first one. Love her. Yeah, I love her. So funny. So like, I mean, it's just such a great way to open it. She's so much fun. She's having so much fun. I think in specials, like especially for 15 minutes, it's really hard to not sound canned or sound like, oh, I'm just like reciting my material. Like this is important and she's like really in the room. Like she doesn't give a fuck. She's just having so much fun. She's a great joke about like the Me Too movement that I had been quoting to people that I don't want to ruin for you. And it's only 15 minutes. Totally worth checking out. Oh, she's great. She's also in the reboot of the first wife's class. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Which is going to be great. She's just like, I just I love her. I worked with her in my first TV writing job at Best Week Ever. I used to write a segment for her called panties on panties off. And if you can know Michelle's style and like my style. So I was like writing stuff and she would say it and like we would kind of work it out so that it would work for her voice. So it was sort of like overly in her own head feminist nerd meets Michelle Bhutan. She was just a dream to work with and I can't wait to watch her 15 minutes. That sounds awesome. Sabrina Jalees too. Also a woman on the 15 minutes. Incredible. Awesome. Great one. A lot of good comedy out now guys. There's a lot of it out. All right. Now we're going to move on to the last that was so Minnesota nice Megan. I'm sorry. Not even from Minnesota. That was shade. It was shade but there is a lot of there is a lot of great comedy out because there's a lot of comedy out. That's true. So maybe that's the last show. It was a good sorry after the sorry segment. I accept. I accept. I don't. Oh. All right. I'm still reeling over the parades. You're going to apologize to me after this. Okay guys. The hill I will die on. Mine is super spooky or weird this week but I was thinking the other day I think about ghosts a lot and I was thinking like what's the scariest genre of ghosts and it's little girls. Yeah. By far the scariest genre of ghosts and my theory about why if you ask anybody most people would probably say little girls are the scariest ghosts. If you watch a horror movie it's like little girl ghosts. It's a scary. It's like it's me. I like that you said genre genre of ghosts. The genre of ghosts that bothers me. They always want to play. I like thrash metal ghosts but I think that I think that people are the most afraid of little girl ghosts because society is meanest to little girls and I think the more the more cruel society is to a demographic the more we realize that society is cruel to a demographic the scarier they are in their afterlife. They got a bone to pick. They've got a B-O-O-O-O-O-N-E to pick. A boon to pick. Mmm. Too soon. I know. I know. Karen what's yours. I said I think this is going to be pretty unpopular in this room given the parades but I will look at my horoscope. Like I'll read it. I will I will look at tarot cards and my thing on this is it's like I don't know about free will. Like I'm not sure that free will is for like do I really want to be responsible for everything in my life. Like everything that's like all on me. Like it's like right now we have this asshole as a president and I know this is going to go against your voting initiative. Everybody vote. Yeah everybody vote. Everybody don't listen to her but I'm like everybody vote or volunteer to watch the kids of people who need child care on voting day. Or drive old people. Drive people. Do whatever you can. Everybody vote. I'm not sure Republicans. But anyway tell me more about free will Karen. But there's a but there's a thing it's like it's nice a little bit of yourself. Do you know what I mean? It's like there is stuff that is out of your control and sometimes it's just nice to be like oh was it me? Was it something that I did or is the world a garbage fire because mercury is in retrograde. Yeah. It's just a little easier sometimes to just be like oh man. Just a little bit of relief. This was out of my hands. Yeah. This was out of my this one was out of my hands. This this one was because of the rings of Jupiter or whatever. I'm with you on this. I am. I could not be less with you. I thank you Megan. I'm with you. I oh my god. Sorry for early. When you are having a personal emotional crisis and you're like pull the car. Why is everything a garbage fire and then you can click on a little link and you can be like oh oh that's why. Oh because the moon card it's the moon card that made it this way. I will die trying to light this hill on fire. And we will be clutching our fire cards. Megan what do you got this week? I prefer Funyuns to onion rings. Give me a Funyuns over an onion ring. I don't know. That's what I want. I do a lot of flavor based hills that I'm dying on last week. I did the cori no one was that mad at me. Funyuns. I want a Funyuns over at an onion ring. That's um the onion ring is the warm one. I don't care. I just like the Funyuns. You're just like the flavor. Yeah and you know I've had like loaded baked potato chips. You know there's lots of flavor chips happening. There's a lot of trash out there to eat. And those I'm not those I'm not even really there for but the Funyuns I think has perfected the onion ring and something bite into an onion ring and then you like pull and stuff doesn't come. I don't like onion rings either. I'm I'm with you on that. Okay. There's a crunch in the Funyuns. Yeah. There's a crunch. There's something about a crunch that's always satisfying. And Erin's looking pretty skeptical. I you know I took this like as soon as I moved out here like three almost three weeks ago now I was like you know what I'm gonna eat. I can eat healthy because in like there's so much produce and so much healthy food out here and it just is easy and also we like get lunch ordered every day at work and I just am like salad. So I haven't eaten fried food at all and the other day I had like a tater tot and it made my stomach just hurt. So I think I've lost the ability to eat Funyuns and onion rings. Oh you're one of those now. Yeah. I love a tater tot. I'll go on record. I like a tater tot more than a french fry. I think I'm gonna try. Whoa. I don't fucking care anymore. Oh these are very interesting hills. I don't know if we'll ever get on the Funyuns Hill or the North Korean record. And that was hysteria. Like what you heard subscribe on iTunes and tell your friends. You can also catch us live at our first show 4 p.m. on Sunday at Outside Lands in San Francisco. We'll be on the Barbary stage and we'll be back with more hysteria next week."
