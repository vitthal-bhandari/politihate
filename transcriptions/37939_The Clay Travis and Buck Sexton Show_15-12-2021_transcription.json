When this mom ended a bad relationship she found out she was pregnant. After the father pressure her to get an abortion Julia was confused and didn't know what to do or where to turn.

Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucks sexton show podcast. Welcome everybody to the second hour of the clay Travis and bucks sexton show. We have a busy one today on this Wednesday December 15th we have with us our friend Alex Berenson author of the best-selling book pandemia get it before it is banned by big tech and all the rest. He also has a sub stack where he's putting out information day in and day out about covid. Alex I mean when you're right you're right and you've been right a lot thanks for being here with us. Thanks for having me. Before we get started I have to say one thing about pandemia which is right now you can get it on Amazon Kindle or nook or apple for $2.90 and it is currently the best-selling book in the country on apple it's number two on Kindle I would like to get it to number one I would like to be able to send that email to Elizabeth Warren who tried to get Amazon to ban me so it's it's it's it's $2.99 it's 12 bucks off the normal Kindle price and you know people people really want the truth right now and if you want to understand what is happening now you have to understand what happened the last two years and that's what the union is absolutely go get your copy folks $2.99 and Kindle hook it up today. Alex tell me this Joe Biden I don't know if you've even heard early in the show but you've probably seen the sound but actually I was gonna say seen it on Twitter but maybe not because they ban you you're never gonna be bad from the clay and book show though Alex don't worry but there's a clip going on a Biden I think this is the last 24 hours just saying this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated and that you won't spread the virus if you get the shot we know that I mean yeah tell us about how not true that is but also what are the numbers at this point it feels like breakthrough cases they've just memory hold the notion of breakthrough cases because they're breaking through everywhere yeah I mean that's a personal I can't believe you would have said that in the last 24 hours now you know as we know he has some some element of mild cognitive impairment so he may just have forgotten you know what today's why is but but I'll tell you this the governor of New Jersey who who's been saying a couple months ago making clearly untrue statements about the number of vaccinated people in the hospital there's a clip today which I just saw on Twitter because you know I'm banned I can I can still see it I'm not you know I haven't had my hands cut off by and he said that 47 percent of people in the hospital now in New Jersey are vaccinated and not boosted and the reason they're starting to tell the truth about it is because they want to get boosters and I think because the truth is so obvious to anybody who is alive and you know has friends who are vaccinated or is vaccinated that they can't hide it anymore I mean if 50 percent of hospice 50 percent of people in any state Alex real quick a 50 percent of people close to in any state in the hospital are or vaccinated and forget about the boosters for a second is not a failure of the policy that they were rolling out all summer um well they would say no and they would say there's still some protection against severe disease and death and you know the people who've been vaccinated it's more than 50 percent and those people are older so they're more likely to be hospitalized and then we can get into an argument about you know something called symptoms paradox and what the numbers really say which which I'm not going to do on every complicated end and we'll bore people but here's here's the truth the truth is the numbers have been way higher than you know 1 percent or 3 percent or 5 percent of people in the hospital being fully vaccinated for a long time and they've been lying about it all year and and the reason I can say that with certainty is that human biology is the same everywhere and we know what the numbers are out of the UK which doesn't lie about this and we know what the numbers are out of Israel which doesn't lie about this and so and so we've known for a long time that the numbers the CDC is offering are basically untrue and there's a couple reasons for that one of which is that the American health care system is so screwed up that not the hospitals are not necessarily recording every vaccinated person as vaccinated when they come in so you know if you got vaccinated somewhere else and you know you're old and sick and you don't tell them that you were vaccinated or you can't even remember when you were vaccinated although you know you were you may go in their system as unknown which translates at the CDC level to unvaccinated so that's clearly been happening I've talked to people in hospitals about that I can tell you how much it's been happening but it has been happening the takeaway is this is something else that they lied about they have lied or been wrong about almost every crucial event in the last two years and this is another one Alex what do we know I'm going to give you an opportunity here because I think the answer could actually be positive what do we know about only cron so far based on all the different data that is coming in Israel England United States has some data and is that data reflective that if it were to pass delta as the primary variant this would actually be really good news for covid the spread based on the data that we're seeing right now I understand things can change but it seems like a much less virulent version of covid than certainly delta great question and you know I think when I was on with you last week I said to the answer that question was yes you know that that amacrom looked like a like a pretty much a positive I think the answer is more qualified right now for too easy the first is that that there's some data there was a study that there's not study but observed population registry at a Denmark that was just published earlier this week showing that the hospitalization levels there although quite low weren't much different for amacrom as earlier variants the second and that would and the other thing that's come up and this has come up anecdotally in the u.s. but also with statistics elsewhere this this variant seems to care not at all about the vaccine and there's some evidence it actually is preferentially infecting people who've been vaccinated which would which would mean it would sort of be a weak version of this terrifying thing called a.d.e. which would which is when a vaccination actually worsens your outcome after infection now we don't have evidence that that's happening but we do have evidence that amacrom you know doesn't seems to it seems to be able to infect people whether they're vaccinated boosted or anything else which raises the question of why boost now let me just pull back for one second your initial theory is right though from what we know out of south africa which has the most cases it is less dangerous so the only way it could be really bad would be in the very short term if a ton of people get infected if there's sort of you know if if a third of the country gets infected let's say over two week period and and it's almost as bad as the previous variants not not quite as bad but almost as bad then you can do some math and you can get you know a lot of strain on the hospitals even even if that happens at the end of that period we should be in better shape because a lot of people who've gone through this and been done with it but but that that's sort of the worst case with amacrom right now but i would agree with you what i said to you last week and what you what you just asked overall amacrom looks like a net positive in terms of what's happening with covid speaking of al-experience and author of pandemia best-selling book get your copy today 299 on kindle. Alex the the the vaccine makers have already talked about the possibility of an oma now they're not saying they're doing it the possibility of an omicron specific variant there is also talk about a fourth shot i believe the fourth shot is approved in israel correct me if if that's wrong for people who are considered at high risk but of course the risk parameters keep changing over time as the vaccines wane in efficacy have we just completely abandoned the notion is there was a time when we believed it was get the shot you're done does anyone think there's even on the horizon a get the shot for covid you won't get infected you don't have to worry about it or has that just been completely abandoned i mean that that's a great question and i don't i don't know what they're you know let's say in a perfect world they could invent that shot okay they could invent what's called a pan coronavirus vaccine that would work for all the variants and would work on term i'm not sure they could sell it to anybody okay because the last year has been such you know a cluster um and their promises have been so unmet that you know i mean i'm not going anywhere near that for years and years and i would suspect that that lots of people now listen i didn't get the vaccine to begin with but i think there are a lot of people who did get the vaccine who feel pretty uh cheated right now and you know i wrote this on my on my sub stack on monday i think i mean we're talking all we're talking medically right now right we're still talking about some scientific questions but i do think politically and culturally much of the united states is past covid and just wants this all just want people to stop talking about this that you know until the day that the hospitals actually collapse people are people the the public health authorities have cried wolf one too many times or ten too many times and people they don't want to hear about it if they didn't get vaccinated they're not getting vaccinated if they did get vaccinated it's for who they did their bit for the team and they don't understand why they should do this again a couple months later and when people like saucy or you know other public health uh you know grandi's say oh we always thought we'd be in a third shot a four shot um people know that's not true i mean we're we were all alive six months ago we can all remember six months ago we're talking to Alex berns and encourage you to go grab his book pandemia Alex last year in mid-January the number of covid cases in the united states peaked i believe it's still the all-time high today england hit a new high for all-time cases what do you think and i know again predictions are sometimes difficult i understand uh that that's a challenge but based on the data that you are seeing from europe and around the world what do you think the next month looks like do you believe that we are going to approach new highs in the number of cases here in january like we did last year i i think it's quite possible i mean it's not just the uk germany is off the charts the netherland's off the charts um uh you know i i think uh cases don't really matter that much right especially if it's omochrom and omochrom is less you know bierland as it seems to be um and i would sort of discourage people from you know from panicking uh if if the case numbers do go up what matters you know is again it's hospitalizations and it's deaths and i will say that you know whether it's because uh you know the uk has boosted a lot of older people so when you boost you get this temporary benefit where you people's antibodies do go up and they are less likely to suffer severe disease and death in the short term the problem is you know you don't know what that looks like long term but if you're dealing with the you know the vulnerable people over 65 and especially over 75 giving them the booster uh you know in the short term reduces death counts and maybe reduces the strain on the hospital system so that's a good thing and that is what you know we've done that in the u.s so i so and they've done it in europe so so the case counts are off the charts but hospitalizations and deaths are not over there and i and i would hope that would be a similar case here through the winter do we know allage if omochron natural immunity would be protective agamiz or any data do we have any idea i mean i really have two natural immunity questions for you one is if you get one variant are you likely protected against the others i know nothing is perfect even actual immunity is not perfect but do we have any numbers on that and also at what point do we see that this disease feels like it will have gotten a infected a solid majority perhaps you know getting upwards of 60 70 percent of the american people i mean how this has been going on for two years so that that's both great questions um the short answer is right now i haven't seen any studies about whether omochron uh translates into other um protection but here's here's how it works right the new variant chases out the old ones so delta came along and and delta was basically 100 percent of the covid out there so it didn't really matter whether delta was protective against older variant it matter whether older variants were protective against delta um and and and that will be the question of omochron is will omochron be protective against the stuff that comes next and that becomes even more complicated now because we're in a situation where many many people have been vaccinated and there's some evidence unfortunately and it's and it's weak right now and i don't want to overstate it but there's some evidence that vaccination may interfere with protective natural immunity after infection some others you get vaccinated you get infected your immunity is not as good as it would be had you been unvaccinated infected and recovered and i'm not and i don't want to say that with any certainty when i say the evidence is weak i mean it's weak but it's there so uh so that's something else that you know here's the thing these are all really complicated questions really good scientists and epidemiologists are going to have to spend a lot of time looking at the data you know in labs figuring it out and then we're going to have to have honest conversations about that but our public health establishment won't be honest and this is what's come up with pandemia so you can't have honest questions about whether masks work or whether lockdowns work or what the effect of lockdowns are or you know the negative effects of closing schools because the people at the top have communicated to each other and to the media that there's one strategy and that's the strategy that's going to be followed today and if it changes tomorrow you know it is served as 1984 world where big brother can never be wrong and we have really difficult questions ahead based both on these variants and on and on the fact that so many people have been vaccinated with these vaccines that don't work as well as we were promised they worked and we need to be able to ask those and we are not asking them Alex a quick question for you to close has anybody at twitter apologized to you for canceling your like i don't mean like jack dorsey himself but has anybody at twitter reached out and said hey by the way the things that you were sharing in the summer have proven to be true because it's unbelievable to me that you've been banned by twitter for things that have proven to be virtually a hundred percent true um no i suspect they have some lawyers even if there were anybody there who and now the jack don't know that there's anybody there who would do that but i suspect their lawyers would tell them you know if you if you say work to that guy you're fired um look we all know i was right um and i and i you know and i don't say that actually any pride it would be better for everybody if i'd been wrong okay it'd be better if i were the fool that you know some people on the left would like me to be um but but no nobody said boo to me and sooner or later you know i keep sort of hinting there's gonna be a lawsuit there's gonna be a lawsuit well i'm gonna hint again there's gonna be a lawsuit and uh you know we'll see what a jury if it gets that far makes of what i said and you know whether twitter was right to kick me off you need to file the lawsuit has to happen i get to that moment past evia is the book folks get your copy today 299 on kindle great deal and

i think we've learned you give these people an inch they will never let go they're going to take a mile they are going to restrict they're going to mandate they're going to lock you down and we cannot accept it obviously in florida we do not accept it so there's no reason to be restricting or mandating anybody throughout our country and the fact that this is still going on in these blue states and may even intensify over the coming weeks and months it just shows you if you value your freedom in 2022 if you're in those states you need to make your voice heard and you got to do a change of direction because i fear that they're going to continue to do this until they suffer at the ballot box there's no doubt that's florida governor ron de santis discussing the continued power grab going on we're in day 700 of 15 days to stop the spread we come back in big cities all of a sudden there's a recognition that crime is out of control we're going to blow your mind with a clip from a blue city from a mayor who's fed up but in the meantime in the worst terror attack to ever take place on american soil 2,977 people lost their lives 20 years ago on september 11 2001 but in the face of horror brave americans responded many even stepped forward to enlist in our armed forces since then more than 7,000 us soldiers have made the ultimate sacrifice those heroes part of the war on terror america's response to 9-11 they fought for us but never came home the tunnel the towers foundation honored those men and women who gave everything by reading their names allowed for the first time

from thanksgiving to new years eve at least one mortgage free home a day given away for 37 days to honor america's greatest heroes you can do good in their honor donate 11 dollars a month at t2t.org that's t2t.org do it today welcome back to clay travis and buck sexton show we have been talking to you about the rise in crime notably homicides and shootings in major cities across the country i think it's about a dozen cities set their all-time record this year just like with inflation folks when the results come in what you find out is the democrats were wrong and not only that they were lying to you as the numbers were coming in about what the conclusions and what the obvious analysis should be about all of it they took soft on crime policies the blm movement created a lot of political cover to push that stuff even further more people were shot more people died more people had their homes broken into their stores vandalized and robbed and yes they're scooters stolen it has been it has been bad for the country across the board right we've all seen that democrats crazy ideas about crime have really negative consequences and it has finally gotten to the point because none of the numbers in the data is in and we could take you through and we've tried to all over the country what are we looking at rise and murders here rise and thefts here rise in burglaries there but what are the democrats going to do about it because it turns out even soy latte drinking lives in san francisco get upset when someone steals their bicycle out of their front yard right it turns out even when someone who votes democrat who lives in chicago or lives in baltimore or new york or you name it has to be in fear of using public transportation there's another horrible attack i just saw this a woman uh... strangled and punched in the face and robbed she just come to this country from tailand she's a young she's a young model aspiring young woman here in new york city attacked brutally attacked the new york subway i was in the subway i can tell you last week in new york for the first time in a little while because you know i try to walk around and yes i had other means of transportation as well that we don't have to talk about but i tried to go around this i went to the subway was deserted depressing and the cars were going to take 30 minutes to get there it's dangerous okay democrats are realizing that this is no longer tenable for them even london breed the mayor of san francisco is saying guess what folks time to get tough on crime and it's time that the reign of criminals who are destroying our city it is time for it to come to an end and it comes to an end when we take the steps to be more aggressive with law enforcement more aggressive with the changes in our policies and less tolerant of all the bull that has destroyed our city we are going to turn this around can i just say that when we tell them the glibs that their cities are being destroyed by these ideas they say that's exaggeration you're lying that's right wing talker it's almost like london breed has been listening to the clay travison bucks that's exactly what i was going to say i don't know how popular we are in san francisco i bet we're more popular than we used to be in san francisco because there's a lot of people out there as you said buck democrats republicans there's also team reality and team insanity and we are on the side of team reality and increasingly i think the democrats are looking at their poll numbers this is this is what's going on right because when you've got a black woman mayor of new york city sorry of san francisco saying that we need more aggressive policing that was called racist when anybody said it for the last year when you even had the idea buck they took cops off of tv the television show cops which had been on for two decades because they said that cops were all awful in the wake of darik shovin they wanted to potentially some people did for those of you out there who watch paw patrol they wanted the cop puppy they wanted him to not be wearing a police uniform i mean this is what people were arguing last year in may in june and it's amazing how quickly this pivot has happened defund the police they're trying to tell you never happen right in many places they're saying oh we never made that argument what are you talking about and a lot of the media are allowing that to occur but for a major city mayor like london briegan in san francisco of all places to be saying hey we got to get police back to be able to do their jobs they got aggressively police to make us safe it's a seismic land shift here i mean you could see this even with some of the blue check beta males of the corporate media out there making arguments about how and specifically in the case of san francisco i think it might have been a piece in san francisco chronicled can't remember now was if it was a couple months ago is it really a big deal if someone breaks into your home and steals stuff from you while you're home if they don't you know attack and brutalize you physically is it really that big a deal and you finally started to have what needs to happen for libs to care here's the here's this the sad little reality folks murders go up while the left pretends to care so much about social justice and particularly social justice as it affects minority communities most of the multi-millionaire libs that you see on msnbc and cnn the editorial pages of the san francisco critical the new york times the washington post they live in safe neighborhoods super tight neighborhoods they send their kids to generally overwhelmingly almost entirely white schools right school's right school community where there's no diversity whatsoever they live in gated communities they pretend to care so much about minorities because they want minority votes and they also want the virtue signaling about you know being fighters against oppression murder rate goes up in the south side of san francisco i mean south side of chicago murder rate goes up in tough parts of oakland tough parts of of baltimore disproportionately affecting minority males and and specifically young african american males are being killed at a higher rate because of their stupid lib ideas they're pushing in these newspapers and in all these channels why do they care now clay oh because you know you know saphora and anthropology and and starbucks and cvs in the fancy neighborhoods are being robbed you know that's where nordstrom in san and san francisco is getting looted and all of a sudden there are all these people out there saying hey we need to do something about these mass uh these mass robberies because you're right the chickens the proverbial chickens have come home to roost when it is primarily an inner city crime issue when black lives matter has primarily led all of the protest to more black lives dying left wingers don't pay attention but as soon as their city's quality of life starts getting impacted all of a sudden they start to raise issues and they want for there to be some sort of response it is amazing too it's it's the democrats pushing for what is often the exact wrong idea right crime is bad you want to make you want less violence in our streets undermining cops and defunding them but also making them making it clear they're not politically supported that is something you do if you want more murders yes and that is what BLM did you know making it easier to stay in the country and get in the country illegally that is what you do if you want more illegal immigration same thing with inflation more spending i mean you look at this the things they do cause the problems quite directly but and we've been warning them we've been saying hey guys it's pretty crazy you don't do this another turn they go oh yeah what a shock it turns out if you let the criminals run wild everywhere and do bad things you get a lot of crime oh okay well and what's amazing also on this is a lot of people aren't going to be held accountable for this if you argued in favor of defund the police you should never be elected to another office for the rest of your life what's going to happen those people are going to get reelected and they're going to pretend they never argued to defund the police if we've learned anything since 2020 there's nothing quite as important of a powerful immune system it's been 20 years now dr.

We're going to take a couple of your calls here i think online three right now we've got sarah in san diego sarah what's up good morning my name is sarah as you just said sorry i'm calling because i'm on a fourth believe right now from my school somebody in my school my classroom was positive and because i'm not vaccinated i was forced out for the next 11 days so i'm taking advantage of this time and i go to my local grocery store because i'm buying from my christmas dinner and but i also heard you talking about gen saki and the beef industry i walked in and i bought myself a hundred and fifty pound a hundred and fifty dollar slab of meat now right now we have a mask mandate just as new york does for the next 30 days i walked in no mask i walked into the counter no mask was an ask about it got that big old slab of meat nobody's anything to me walked on my way out the store the manager was there reminded me of the mask however she didn't force it probably because i was walking out with a hundred and fifty dollars with emergency well you know what you're in california i'm surprised you didn't want to walk out with a hundred and fifty dollar merchandise without paying for it because that wouldn't be arrested much everywhere i'll be right by the way how long do you say you have an 11 day quarantine yeah what great new t-day quarantine from my school yes 11 day quarantine from my school because i'm that vaccinated that's crazy but that's insane that's what we do is but claim member thank you so much for calling in sarah this is what i've been saying is that we're going back to that period where now even if you're near someone who has covid if you've had covid or you're vaccinated you're expected to quarantine so what i thought we had some protection i thought we had done you know thought we're in the trust tree the nest you know i mean i guess also she's breaking quarantine to go buy meat because i mean you need meat you know i know i know hundred fifty dollars in meat that sounds like a good uh christmas program at buck sexton by the way clay it was a prime rib the double prime rib which i highly recommend to folks oh you got me hungry i mean that's one of the challenges of this time slot is you know it's right around lunch yeah if anyone calls in start talking about food it's real hard not to start taking time to open up some potato chips in here justin in skynectady new york justin you got some thoughts on new york state's mask laws which are driving me insane what's up guys so check this out i called the governor's office today first of all thanks for having me on been looking at you guys come out love the show thank you so much thank you so much i called the governor's office today governor hokos office i was transferred to her press room and i am currently sitting here with a video in hand because i'm at work so the only proof that i had of this phone call was a video taken of me on speakerphone with the press will the press room says there is no executive order for a mask mandate in new york state governor hokos lied to us all of us there is no thousand dollar fine and there is no list of the mask mandate on the list of executive orders on the press room's website wait i mean uh how is that's interesting i called her up and i asked i said hi my name is so-and-so i'm i'm here in this part of new york i was curious i'd like to grab a copy of um the executive order for my business and and that kind of thing so that way i know where i'm where i stand so is this is essentially a process objection you're talking about here justin whereby the governor has just proclaimed a mandate but has not done the official paperwork and paper trail and record public record necessary for it to be an official executive order is out because we all know she said you got to do this mask thing that is correct this is what i was told today is that the woman from the department of health uh the commissioner from the department of health made a recommendation there is no mask mandate not as of yet nothing in writing with nothing with governor opal signature i can tell you this much justin for the buckster there is no mask mandate i'm not wearing that stupid thing in my building in my gym uh it's not happening it's not how i would encourage everybody out there if somebody i don't want you to be like hey you're gonna get arrested if you try to go to casko because you're not wearing a mask and certainly i don't want you to get evicted from being able to fly on airplanes but if you can mask non-compliance should be occurring until someone in my opinion requests that you put one on and then you can comply but i wouldn't voluntarily be that make them make you make them make you mask don't just do it as a as sort of a preemptive strike justin thanks so much connected in new york brian in frasno california we're going one coast to the other here what's up brian hey what's going on guys uh real quick um transgender sports last year girlfriend irean vegas we're staying at the hotel cross street from raider stadium it just happened to be the host hotel for a high school national track meet and while was down there uh witnessed a parent being told by a scout who came to the daughter brought in hotel room because there was biological boys against her their daughter couldn't place uh in any of the four heats that she ran in so she lost all of her scholarships well thank you for the call i mean look this is the big question right and we've been covering this and talking about it and well actually maybe as senator marcia blackburn what she thinks about it because i i again if you are going to allow biological men to compete against women then the biological men particularly if they are already skilled at a sport as was the case at the university of pennsylvania are going to win it is a simple matter of biology men are bigger stronger faster they are going to dominate women's sports so women's sports i don't think this is an exaggeration are facing an existential threat same thing for scholarships and everything else because some of these coaches are going to say hey if i get went a national championship with three biological dudes why wouldn't i do it if that's allowed under the rules yeah and i just it's just an update to it first of all of course you're 100 correct and the left is mad and saying they're they've gone in a mad as they're insane and we'll continue talking about that but i just got an update here clay elan musk is not done trolling elizabeth warren senator warren
