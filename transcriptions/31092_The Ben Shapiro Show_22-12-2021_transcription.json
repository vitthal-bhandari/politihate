That's eXPR. Yes S VPN calm slash Ben Express VPN calm slash Ben to learn more already. So yesterday There's an article rocketing around the internet. It was from New York magazine The cover of New York magazine Featured a quote unquote trans man meaning a biological woman who believes that she is a man Whose new name is Gabrielle Mac. Okay. Gabrielle or Gabrielle Mac the original name of this human was in fact Mac McClellan But then this woman decided that she is in fact some sort of trans man and therefore had to appear on the cover of New York magazine in her underwear. I say her because I only use biological pronouns on this show in her underwear after having a breast removal surgery and after having had a surgery to essentially carve a fake penis out of her leg and then attach it to herself This is what our society has become in one photo This is what our society has become when radical subjectivism rules the roost and reality is forced to bow before the altar of radical Subjectivism what you end up with is Effectively bodily mutilation. There's no way to look at this photo and not see a form of bodily mutilation This is literally a person who has had flesh from her leg removed in order to carve out a fake genitalia and Then say that she has now become a man by the way This person also says that she has retained her original female genitals in terms of her vagina, so she still has a biological vagina and now has added on a fake penis through a phalloplasty and I say fake penis because this is not a Naturally grown thing shall we say it is it is carved out of human flesh? Okay now I don't mean to be extremely graphic, but that's the entire point of the article The entire point of the article from New York magazine is to be as extremely graphic as possible Which is why the photo is on the cover of New York magazine And that's why you have extremely graphic photos of what the leg looks like after the removal of the flesh And you are supposed to just mirror the perspective of the article You're supposed to mirror the idea that this person used to be a woman and is now a man So over the weekend I was rereading 1984 and the truth is that 1984 while it is a a morality play about the Stalin-esque Soviet regime In reality, it's a little bit deeper than that what it really is is about how you control minds It's about thought crime and doublethink and mind control. That's how people's minds are captured and then used against them And this is what we are in the midst of culturally in the United States You are not allowed be few centimeters in your brain that allow you a level of thought freedom That would be to commit a thought crime if you right now are thinking that this person Obviously suffers from a mental disorder and I will bring you more information about this person just a moment That this person obviously suffers from a mental disorder and that and that brutal surgeries are very unlikely To represent a solution to that mental disorder If you think that then this means that you are a vicious terrible person What's more if you go even further and you say this person remains a biological woman With a diagnosable mental disorder If you say that then this means that you're a bigot now to most people this just sounds like common sense because As a rule if you go on the cover of a magazine wearing nothing but your underwear To show the scars from your top surgery and from Your addition of a of a penis from fallowplasty by carving flesh from your leg This is not a great sign of a mentally well-ordered person It just isn't Hey, but if you say that then this means that you are somehow gender You are transphobic you are heteronormative your cis shit, right all of this nonsense Okay, so Orwell writes in 1984 and this is really the the essence of 1984 Says double think lies at the very heart of the regime since the essential act of the party is to use conscious deception while retaining the firmness of purpose that goes with complete honesty To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them to forget any fact that has become inconvenient And then when it becomes necessary again to draw back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed To deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies All this is indispensable necessary This is correct. This is the the culture that we have now been creating for ourselves Orwell writing about this in the context of of Soviet mind control essentially he says In the end the party would announce that two and two made five and you would have to believe it It was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later the logic of their position demanded it Not merely the validity of experience but the very existence of external reality was tacitly denied by their philosophy The heresy of heresies was common sense and what was terrifying was not that they would kill you for thinking otherwise But that they might be right for after all How do we know that two and two make four or that the force of gravity works or that the past is unchangeable If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind and if the mind itself is controllable what then In order to reach utopia you wonder why this is part of a left wing agenda because really this What does this have to do with redistribution of income per se? What does this have to do with the structures of the economy? What does this have to do even with fairness and equity? What does it have to do with any of this stuff? What do bizarre claims about the nature of gender that are completely Anti-biological and anti-common sense What does that have to do with any of this and the answer is it all lies in the root belief that man is entirely malleable And that reality exists entirely in the mind. So if we just shift how we think about reality a man can be a woman a woman can be a man All human beings can be remolded and shaped into utopian forms of themselves Widgets that we can play with from the top down to create a better society That is how this particularly bizarre and radical perspective on gender fits into the broader left wing rubric because once you have subjected yourself to relentless Subjectivism once you have decided that radical subjectivism is the truth about life that reality does not exist out here There's no such thing as reality. There are no such things of rules rules of biology do not exist rules of physics do not exist Rules of history do not not nothing exists The only thing that exists is in your mind And that's the only thing that matters because it grants you a sense of authenticity Once you believe that you can accomplish anything in this view. That is why this is important Not because this particular person this particular person Doing what this person wishes to do with their life. I disagree with the decisions I don't think this is going to alleviate anything I think the surgeons who perform these sorts of surgeries are committing a grave sin against humanity frankly, but Adults are adults in a free country Hey, that said The the baseline notion that the rest of society has to accept as truth something that is obviously a lie is extraordinarily dangerous And it ties into a broader belief system that says that lies can become the truth So long as those lies are convenient and necessary for the pursuit of utopia In a second, I'm gonna get to the story of this person because I've sort of alluded to it But the story really does tell the entire tale we get to that in just one moment First Do you know that garages are the most frequently accessed entry to the home?

I care because you put this on the cover of a major national magazine That's why I care because you made this a national story a person making what I believe to be a bad decision for themselves is not a national news story You made it a national news story And the reason you did so is specifically so that when we comment on it when we notice that you are fighting against common sense and frankly common decency When we notice that you are lying to people about the malleability of human sex When we notice that you call us bigots and you say why are you even noticing? Why why do you notice? Why do you notice? We're noticing because you have made this the front line of the culture war And you want to dictate this to my children You want to tell my kids that your view of gender insects is the real view of gender insects And you want to call anybody who disagrees a bigot? In other words, this is bait But if you don't take the bait then they win Because if you don't take the bait then the assumption is that what they are saying has some relation to reality or decency and it has no relation to either And so honestly, I feel terrible for this human being the reason I feel terrible for this human being is this person obviously has serious problems Here is a story from july 5th 2011 Journalist stages her own rape to cure trauma of witnessing sex attack on woman in hatie For journalist macmachlellan you'll notice that gabriel mac and macmachlellan are the same human Her journalist macmachlellan it gripped her body and her mind in such a severe way She had to simulate a violent rape to get over it The mother jones civil rights reporter was on a job in hatie in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake when she met a woman She called sibil who'd been raped at gunpoint and brutally mutilated by a gang of men After miss mcklellan 31 accompanied her to the hospital where the surgeon who performed a reconstructive surgery on her told her she was a slut and deserved What she got they were on their way back in a taxi when sibil saw one of the men who raped her miss mcklellan recalls she went into a full paroxysm wailing and flailing in terror screaming with her eyes rolling an abject terror It was at that point that something snapped in miss mcklellan too Despite the fact that she had seen the impact of sexual violence all around the globe having reported from the conga and bermah This incident was more than she could take According to abc she became progressively enveloped in the classic symptoms of post-traumatic stress Avoidance of feelings flashbacks for current thoughts that triggered crying spells She couldn't get out of bed in the morning and had nightmares and daymares about rape The 31-year-old went to see a therapist in her home of san francisco and despite getting treatment for ptsd She told her therapist all she wanted to do was have incredibly violent sex Her therapist suggested it was a good idea and told her to find someone who she trusted enough to do it miss mcklellan believed it was this staged violent rape with a close friend that cured her She even wrote an article about it for the online magazine good In it she explains how her sexual partner mercilessly pinned her beat her about the head and brutally violated her She wrote about the rape i did not enjoy it in a way a person getting screwed normally would but as it became clear that i could endure I started to take deeper breaths and my mind stayed there stayed present even when it became painful Even when he smothered me with a pillow not to asphyxiate me But so that he didn't break my jaw when he drew his elbow back and slammed his fist into my face two three four times My body felt devastated but relieved i'd lost but survived after he climbed off me He gathered me up in his arms i broke into a thousand pieces on his chest sobbing so hard my ribs felt my ribs felt like they were coming loose She told abc. I was not crazy. It was a way for me to deal in a sort of simulated but controlled situation It was still awful and the body doesn't understand when it's in a fight So this is a person who was not rape had ptsd from not Her rape but from witnessing another person's response to a rape And had a friend simulate rape in which she was beaten Okay, so this is the person that we are talking about Does this sound like a mentally ordered person to you a well-ordered person to you And this is not to rip on people who have mental disorders there are people in my family with mental disorders My grandfather i've talked about it openly was a manic depressive who was suicidal from time to time Okay, so this is not to mock the mentally disorder This is to point out that when a society treats mental disorders as perfectly healthy behavior You incentivize mental disorders and by the way, you don't heal anybody you don't make anybody better In fact in many cases you make them worse when you humor mental disorder You are not making the mental disorder better My grandfather who is manic depressive as i mentioned Right he had the experience of believing that the radio was talking to him telling him to kill himself And for years my grandmother who just passed away my grandmother would lie in bed and tie her foot to his Because she knew that if he got up in the middle of the night he might try to kill himself with a razor That is what mental disorders are To pretend that the radio actually was talking to him and we just needed to humor that would have been cruelty It wasn't until he got on lithium decades later that he actually began to live in normal life A treating people who are mentally disordered as though that is a form of mental order and that it's only society that has done something wrong is cruel and nasty And then to dictate to the rest of the world that the rest of the world is supposed to mirror this perspective is insane And it promotes insanity Okay, and this brings us to the New York magazine cover piece My penis myself. I didn't need a penis to be a man, but I needed one to be me Well, actually it turns out you're not a man. It turns out you're a biological woman with As evidenced by your your own coverage of the issues Some problems And I feel honest to god I feel terrible for this person But to pretend that this person is just a mentally healthy man is ridiculous on every possible level that is possible for It makes a mockery of the word ridiculous to suggest this is ridiculous It'll get to more of this and just one and by the way demanding that all of us acquiesce and approve and cheer and putting it on the cover of magazines A this is 1984 double think that is what this is It will get to more of this in just one moment first I am thrilled to announce an incredible app everyone who buys gas needs to know about get upside My listeners are making up to 25 cents for every gallon of gas every time they fill up Just download that free get upside app in the app store or google play right now Use promo code Shapiro get a bonus 25 cents per gallon on your first fill up That's up to 50 cents cash back.

Okay. So this brings us to the actual cover story from New York magazine Okay On the day I heard that my penis would be huge I sobbed In the car outside the doctor's office afterward I bent my torso in half and bald my face against the dashboard my boyfriend petting my back to console me But confused isn't it good news that they can do it like at all and obviously yes It was growing up without one I thought or maybe convinced myself that mine would grow in later to the extent that when I see a woman in typans I still often instinctively think where is her penis? But my period at 12 aptly agonizingly bled to death that increasingly implausible dream of reconciling with life with god That he wouldn't make me like this and leave me like this forever So the news 28 years later that the agony was going to be over abundantly over was a bit much to take in I fixated on the information that a pert little average flaccid package was not an option for me When I asked the surgeon how big my impending penis was going to be he could only guess pointing to the reusable water bottle in my hand A metal cylinder nine inches in circumference smaller than that I was so different from everybody else. I would I had always been so different Fallow plastic in general. It was clear. It was hard for people to accept Well, I will love you no matter what sweetie assist female best friend of mine said when I told her I was transitioning years before as long as you don't get a dick One flatly demanded don't get a dick It was another trans masculine person I used to know said disgusting insane to want or to have a surgeon Make a sense aid fallis out of your arm or leg or somewhere and franken stitch it to your body To go so far out of your way to opt into a tool perhaps the tool of so much suffering I love that there are people who are so left wing that the presence of A penis is itself Somehow an act of violence. Okay, most trans masculine people don't get one the seminal print trans mask magazine was named after not getting one original plumbing I saw trans masculine support groups shut down and go silent more than once when someone brought up the procedure and later When I was that someone I was twice invited to leave with other people who might want to talk about that Whatever magical spectrum of unicorn gender expression was otherwise being embraced It ended firmly before needing a socially culturally, politically, historically, personally emotionally medically complicated dick But I did and I couldn't outrun it any longer Literally the day I gave in and admitted that for me It was penis or death came after a last-ditch bout of denial in which I drove 1400 miles in three days only to have acknowledged Devastated at my destination that I couldn't avoid it anymore So this person had to call six surgeons offices and pcp's office 19 times referrals the insurance company 17 times for necessary authorization and um These folks Get together people who have had the surgery and I discussed the feeling of having a surgically created penis And what's high testicle implants to get This person says Quote There's a scene in the disney's original dumbbow when the child's elephant mom cradles him in her trunk and sings to him exuding love quietly But wholly as a kid feeling utterly unheld by this world I hated it as a grown man in a hospital bed chest loosely draped with a gown in a low lit December room I looked down in the direction of a penis I'd assumed would be covered in bandages But then there it was laid out in an angle toward my left eye propped on a green cloth and I awed and heartful and weeping Saying that song to it, baby mine I don't know the words Uh While i'd been sleeping two microsurgeons a recon reconstructive urologist a surgical fellow and a surgical resident had among other things Cut a seven seven by six inch rectangle out of my right and seriatere lateral thigh They taken all the skin and fat plus one big nerve and some veins attached to the muscle and connected the skin itself In the shape of a phallus then they slipped the whole thing under two of my thigh muscles Pulled up out of the way with a steel retractor dragged the phallus across my groin under the skin And pulled it back out into the world through a hole cut in the skin over my pubic bone They connected the new penis's nerve to one of the nerve bundles in my native penis, which some people call a clitoris Yeah, that's not a native penis That's called a clitoris Which they'd cut free of its ligaments then skinned then tunnels up under the skin and out to the landing site of the new penis The base of which they joined the base of my pelvis putting me all back together with sutures some finer than a human hair That penis dr. Pabexafa one of the microsurgeons said when he came by to see me after to see us looks perfect He was mostly talking about the blood flow He did not mean that with its fresh stitches and a round bloody hole at the top where the skin would eventually close together It would look like any other penis at the spa, but also it was a lovely shape Okay, so are we supposed to believe that this makes you a man? Is that the idea that this makes you so according to this person this didn't make them a man the feeling made them a man But they needed the penis in order to feel complete And then this needed to be put on the cover of New York magazine to promote the idea that this is A reflection of biological reality that this person is a man now that Understand this article is not about Gabriel Mac and this person's experiences in life This article is about you Because the goal is to make you believe Make you believe that two and two or five That is the goal and if you refuse to believe two and two or five this makes you a bigot This makes you a bad person. This means you'll be socially ostracized This means that common sense must go by the wayside The demand is not For quote-unquote tolerance the demand is for acceptance and celebration And belief more than anything else belief Radical subjectivism is not the way any functional society can work Because radical subjectivism eventually and this is the point in 1984 radical subjectivism Eventually will be subjugated in favor of a top-down Version of reality that somebody wants to impose and that top-down version of reality that somebody wants to impose particularly the folks in the media Is a version of reality That is absolutely contrary to actual biological Physical reality But allows for the possibility of innate malleability of humanity in any direction that they choose. That's the goal again, I'm Gabriel Mac can do whatever Gabriel Mac wants to do in a free country Although again, I think surgeons who perform these sorts of surgeries are doing nobody any great service I think that the notion that that obvious mental disorders are going to be solved by By brutal surgeries that require years of healing in many cases that this is not that 20 years from now people are going to look back at this in the same way that people look at curing seizures by putting an ice ice pick in your eye like this is that By doing lobotomies like this is But put that aside What this is really about more than anything else is getting you Again to believe tune to our five. That's what this is about Alrighty, and just one second we'll get to the latest on oh Macron where everybody has spiraled into panic again the data on omochron suggests this thing is not particularly deadly We get to that in just one moment first It is a great time of year to get somebody the most meaningful gift So what is the most meaningful gift legacy box? Okay, so as I mentioned a little bit earlier on in the show My grandmother who was 91 passed away Over the course of the last week Well, one thing that was amazing that I had done for my parents and that really Has helped them in this time is I used legacy box about a year ago And we preserved all the old family photos So we took all the old family photos that were there were in boxes in the garage And we shipped them off to legacy box and now they are digitally preserved forever Which is an amazing amazing thing means they can pass those photos on to me and to my kids Legacy box makes that happen for you Right you got a bunch of old films out in the garage You got a bunch of old film reels or vhs tapes you can't use those anymore So get those digitally transferred over now they're accessible and make a great gift to family Again legacy box is a very it's one of the most meaningful things i've ever done for my parents And in future proof your family's legacy relax knowing your irreplaceable moments can be easily viewed shared and passed on for future generations Their exclusive barcoated online tracking system provides up to 12 emailed updates along the way Prices are under 40 bucks make this holiday season special give the gift of memories with christmas just around the corner There's still times by the best christmas gift ever visit legacy box dot com slash shapiro take advantage of an exclusive discount for listeners Legacy boxes are still in stock ready to ship visit legacy box dot com slash appear for an exclusive offer that's legacy box dot com slash shapiro already meanwhile omicron panic continues to wash across the land like a vast ugly tidal wave Yesterday joebiden laid out his plan for omicron suffice it to say joebiden's plan for omicron is going to be completely ineffective because guess what's going to be effective against omicron the answer You may have guessed is nothing that is correct It turns out that the omicron stats from south africa are demonstrating that omicron is not Supremely dangerous. It is not as dangerous as delta. It is not as dangerous as the original variant south africa is about 25 to 30 percent facts But omicron which is spiked in south africa and now is coming down the other side in south africa Did not kill massive numbers of people In fact, it killed so few people in south africa that anthony fauci has been forced to actually acknowledge the reality Which is that natural immunity might be a thing because so many people in south africa had already had COVID and when they got omicron it didn't matter very much Right it's amazing to see uh anthony fauci suddenly acknowledged that natural immunity ought to be taken into account here He was discussing south africa It is likely That the reason that it is less severe Is that in south africa What you have is a very large proportion of the population has already been infected and recovered And a relatively smaller proportion have been vaccinated So it is likely that the protection against infection is not very good because it will get into the nays of farricks and infect you The reason they may have a less severe is that the underlying Cross protection that you have From an experience of a virus of a different variant Might actually be protecting you from severe disease which predominantly involves the lungs Okay, so um i'm noticing here that suddenly he believes in natural immunity Welcome to the club which has been around as a martin coldor former professor at harvard medical school says that the club of people who have understood natural immunity is a thing has existed for approximately 1700 years something like that Hey, i'm glad that and the thing fauci has finally joined the club that doesn't mean by the way He's not going to press for vax mandates even for people who already have natural immunity So president biden decided to give a speech yesterday the speech is not directed at actually solving the problem The speech is directed at pretending to solve the problem because again when it comes to this cult the high priesthood Must maintain that if only you would obey them the problems would be solved the problems won't be solved Okay, you're not solving omochron. It is 70 times as transmissible as delta delta was twice as transmissible as the original variant That means that omochron is 140 times as transmissible as the original variant in other words We're all getting omochron in the same way we all get a cold and here's the good news By the statistics available from south africa and from the uk by the way You're not going to die from it. In fact, you are probably going to get mildly ill from it If you're vaccinated you're almost certainly going to get only mildly ill from it if you're unvaccinated theoretically you could get more sick We don't know how much more sick Not as sick as you would have been if you got delta So president biden has now outlined his strategy apparently the strategy includes doubling down on vax campaigns Been propping up hospitals as they confront a large influx of patients Federal officials will direct resources including army doctors to support health care systems and distribute rapid tests to americans The president biden's speech was mostly directed at trying to scare the living hell out of you But here is the thing omochron should be the time when you're not so scared Okay, I'm noticing all around me Institutions that are shutting their schools that are shutting down for example in the face of omochron kids are not dying even of delta They're certainly not dying of omochron We should not be testing the asymptomatic We should not be pursuing a lockdown strat that that's what this ends with by the way if you test the asymptomatic or locking down society It's that simple omochron is too transmissible too many people have it So if the idea is that if you're diagnosed with omochron and you're asymptomatic You're not supposed to stay home for 10 days and you combine that with everyone should get tested half of society will be staying home You will shut down the entire economy of the united states Okay, but everything they do is not geared toward success. It's geared toward leaving the impression that they can control this thing So in reality, here's the actual solution to omochron. You ready for this you're ready for this You should get vaxed if you're vulnerable or if you're older You should have done that the entire pandemic. I've been very clear about this And then if you get omochron That's all you will get omochron. We all get omochron. We will virtually all survive and we'll move on with our lives Done. That's the plan I know it sounds really crazy and really difficult to say that some people are going to get mildly ill and then that's going to the end of it But that's kind of what the stats show At this point If a joe biden So joe biden is in a tough spot. He's made a catch 22 for himself on the one hand if he shuts down the economy his presidency continues to crater On the other hand he has suggested that he is going to shut down the virus I mean he literally tweeted out he would shut down the virus which no human being is capable of doing So that means that he's going to try to split the baby. He says we should be concerned about omochron, but not panicked I have an idea. I'm vaxed. I'm not concerned or panicked about omochron And as far as my kids go, I'm not concerned or panicked about my kids getting omochron Because nobody who knows any of the data is concerned about kids getting omochron My parents are triple vaxed. I'm not concerned about them getting omochron My wife is triple vaxed because she's a doctor. I'm not worried about her getting omochron So, um, how about I'm not concerned or panicked Here's joe biden anyway We should all be concerned about omochron but not panicked If you're fully vaccinated and especially if you got your booster shot You are highly protected That you're unvaccinated You're at a higher risk, ready severely ill from covid 19 getting hospitalized and even dying So the best thing to do is get fully vaccinated and get your booster shot Okay, well As far as the booster shots go but the data tend to show is that if you are elderly or immunocompromised You should get a booster shot because what the boosters basically do is they increase the number of antibodies in your system Antibodies prevent the infection so you can get a temporary boost and that will prevent the infection for a certain period of time If you have a slower immune system, which is what it means to be older or be immunocompromised This means that preventing the disease is probably A good bet, right? It's worthwhile if you're 30 Your t-cell B cell memory is going to kick in and you're going to be able to fight this off So you will get infected and then you'll have a mild cold and your nose will run and then you'll be done Okay, so that that is that is why boosters are are in apisite for everyone In fact, there are many scientists including the WHO who suggest that boosters for 30 year olds should be foregone In favor of getting first doses to people who are in africa who have not been vaccinated at all for example Okay, then joe biden again. He's trying to split the baby because he's stuck He has made a promise he cannot fulfill He was going to shut down the virus, but he can't shut down the virus So on the one hand we're not going back to march 2020 because if we go back to march 2020 He's toast his party's toast. He knows it. So here he says we're not going back to march 2020 conditions But somebody needs to ask him why we're not going back to march 2020 conditions considering that omochron is going to spread Way faster than the original variant and you're telling people to be concerned Another question that folks are asking is are we going back to march 2020 not this last march 2021 But march 2020 when the pandemic first hit That's why I keep getting asked the answer is absolutely no No Here are three big differences between then and now one Number one the first one more than 200 million americans have been fully vaccinated in march 2020 No one was fully vaccinated Okay, so he's saying that the vaccinations are what is going to prevent us from going march 2020 But you and your administration are saying that people who get are still going to have to quarantine for up to 10 days Which means effectively speaking that if you have mass testing combined with that particular rule And lack of symptoms You will go back to march 2020. It won't be a formal lockdown. It won't be shut your businesses doors It will be businesses cannot operate without their employees or their customers So you will back door march 2020 into actual policy Okay, so then joe biden says you can celebrate christmas if you and those who celebrate with you are vaccinated Now here's what makes no sense about this if you're vaccinated you should be able to celebrate with the unvaccinated That's the reality the vaccines work in preventing hospitalization and death and you can be infected by somebody else who's vaccinated Half the people I know at this point probably have omicron and have infected each other and they're vaccinated so nobody cares Yeah, but here is joe biden saying an nonsensical thing And I know some america's are wondering if you can safely celebrate the holidays with your family and friends The answer is yes, you can If you and those who celebrate with are vaccinated Particularly if you've gotten your booster shot If you are vaccinated and follow the precautions that we all know well You should feel comfortable celebrating christmas in the holidays as you planned it You know you've done the right thing You could enjoy the holiday season Okay, well, here's the thing if you're unvaccinated you can also enjoy the holiday season. You're just at higher risk than the vaccinated Okay, and then he gets to this is kind of an amazing statement from joe biden So he says we're vaccinating you to save your life and we're not vaccinating you because we want to control your life We're vaccinating you to save your life well If this standard were held by the government the government would control your life And because it turns out that the number one cause of death in the united states is heart disease heart disease is highly linked to obesity Do you really want the government deciding what you can eat on a daily basis? Realistically speaking the principle of which he is speaking this broad principle that the government can do anything it wants in order to save your life Is uh as we say over broad Hey, here's joe biden saying we're vaccinating you to save your life not control your life I know vaccination requirements are unpopular For many Not even popular for those who are anxious to get them My administration has put them in place not to control your life, but to save your life in the lives of others Okay, so saving the lives of others is not really the issue in the sense that again vaccinated people can transmit the disease It is true that if you could force if you are a benevolent dictator and you could force everybody to get vaccine if your people would die The problem is we still have in this country a baseline notion That you should be able to make decisions about your own health that affect you Hey that that is just that that is a baseline level of liberty And once the government gets to decide that they can do whatever they want in order to quote unquote save your life That means there are no limits. Are you going to pin michael bloomberg land? No soda no meat no eggs We all we all eat like joe biden wants us to eat if there's no limiting principle here There is no end to the control, which of course is kind of the idea. There is no end to the control By the way, there's a certain irony here that irony is that joe biden's press secretary jens hockey was asked yesterday about whether joe biden had covid And her answer was less than edifying How's the president feeling given close contact is he doing okay? I know he's getting touched tomorrow, but he gave us an update He's asymptomatic. I spent several hours with him this morning And he is feeling great and you'll see him at the speech shortly a question That was not the question the question was has the president tested recently and jens hockey's answer was he's asymptomatic Okay, so that's actually a good answer if you hold by my logic that is a terrible answer if you hold by joe biden's logic By my logic if you're asymptomatic, I don't care whether you have covid I really don't Because asymptomatic people have all sorts of stuff We have never in the history of humanity tested people for asymptomatic things With the intent of shutting down their lives The notion of testing the asymptomatic is a bizarre one So by my lights if joseph joe biden is asymptomatic he doesn't need to test But we've been told that joe biden tests every day And we were told that earlier this month So if he tests every day and jens hockey saying he's asymptomatic that means that there's a good shot that he actually has covid and is asymptomatic And yet he's out there doing what he wants to do I'm not sure what else i'm supposed to take away from jens hockey answering the question is to his covid positive status by saying he is asymptomatic You don't get to use jens hockey logic here if you use my logic to come to that particular conclusion Okay, what all this is resulting in is is a vastly discombobulated policy and you can see it on the left I mean they're just running around waving their hands around in the air like the crazy inflatable men have used car lot It's just a bunch of conflicting proposals that make no sense in tandem with one another we'll get to that in just one second first And let's say that you are a dinosaur living in prehistoric times And the weather has started to turn and the volcanoes have started to erupt and all you want to do is get your little dinosaur child To safety we'll call him little foot, but something goes dramatically wrong Well, as you lay your head down for the last time you might think to yourself man at the very least I should have gotten little foot Some tree star life insurance You should have used policy genius head on over to policy genius dot com slash appear right now answer a few questions about yourself in minutes You can work out how much life insurance coverage you need compare personalized quotes to find your best price You could say 50 percent or more on life insurance by comparing quotes with policy genius Their license experts will help you understand your options and apply for a policy the policy genius team works for you Not the insurance company you can trust them to offer unbiased help and advocate for you at every step until you are covered Policy genius does not add on extra fees or sell your information to third parties head on over to policy genius dot com slash appear Your free life insurance quotes see how much you could save that's policy genius dot com slash Shapiro policy genius Dot com slash Shapiro go check it out right now Okay, we're gonna get to the actual policy preferences of this administration in just one second first a couple of big announcements first Last night the daily where premiered a very special episode of candace Candace owns travel tomorrow logal for a face-to-face interview with former president Donald trump for an in-depth conversation with one of the most censored men On planet earth here is candace on the interview Today i'm going to stand with him and i'm going to give him a fair but a tough interview with critiques that have come from his own side I voted for president trump make no mistake But there are tons of questions that need answering and I hope that i'm able to deliver that to you all today Welcome to candace The interview is streaming exclusively to members at dailywire.com head on over to dailywire.com slash Subscribe to join today and start watching if you did candace head on over to the yes we candace Dot com store pick up some awesome candace merch also.

They've created a catch 22 for themselves. Yes, we'll stop covid also We can't stop covid this creates a lot of bizarre proposals So the great and powerful Anthony phalgy he says that um if you're unvaxed You should stay away from the vax and vice versa his duck the Anthony phalgy explaining If someone in your family isn't vaccinated should he ask them not to show up Ah, yes, I would do that I mean, I think we're dealing with a series enough Situation right now that if there's an unvaccinated person, I would say i'm very sorry But not this time maybe another time when this is all over Um, okay, that's ridiculous if you're vax you shouldn't be afraid of the unvax you should be done And meanwhile the new york times are saying maybe schools are going to have to close no schools don't have to close The kids are not vulnerable yet idiots And yet dana goldstein writes for the new york times The dread was familiar as news spread of the latest covid surge fueled by the omochron variant parents faced a return to the drudgery of school through a screen Child care crises and restless young bodies penned inside for the winter in manhattan Olivia strong receives an email from her son's public middle school on monday informing her at his cohort of eighth graders Would transition to remote learning because of multiple positive virus cases? I fully expected it. She said sign deeply Her hope she added was that a short break to reset would allow schools to reopen more safely in the new year I mean, I'm sorry. This is insane. This is insane kids are not dying of this virus They've not been dying of this virus the entire time And yet they continue now that now they're talking about school shutdowns really like all over the country They're people who are talking about school shutdowns because of the covid paranoid Members of the the covid cult have decided that they are going to ensure that kids Are not allowed to go to school which by the way raising anxiety and depression among kids We saw a vast amount of that over the course of the last year and a half It means they fall behind that other than the masking of kids is having some pretty dire effect on on how kids operate in the real world the data are in and masking has Serious downsides which is not shocking it turns out when they take small kids and you don't expose them to human faces They're not that good at reading emotions. It actually screws with their IQ. It is not good And yet this administration is at the same time Joe Biden is saying it's not march 2020 Meanwhile the administration is like well it might be march 2020 So here's education secretary Miguel Cardona saying that the school shutdowns in the first place We're not overdone on what basis on what basis Absolutely not and i'm not only speaking as an educator, but as a parent Not only did we want to make sure we protected our children and our staff With information that we know now, but we didn't know them But I think it's really important to read folks that children can carry it and they could spread it to their grandparent They could spread it to family members back at a time when we didn't have vaccines You know, we lost so many lives And I believe that the precautions that we took were necessary. Okay, Europe didn't shut down at schools and Nope, this is just wrong. This is wrong. I mean the evidence that school shutdowns were a good idea That evidence does not exist. The evidence is completely absent in every possible way And by the way, if he thinks that it was bad in march 2020 and the problem is you can infect grandma Well, guess what? Omocron is way more infectious So why wouldn't they push for school shutdowns meanwhile? Rochelle will ask you his question about masking and vaccinating kids because again kids are not dying of the virus and also There are there's no evidence that masking kids is useful at all And so she's just not going to answer the question She's just going to maintain that you have to do all of these things because this is what the cult requires Will you follow the science and stop relying on faulty studies and end mask mandates for children in schools? response You know there have been study after study not only in this country but in other countries that have demonstrated That our layered prevention strategies including masks in schools are able to keep our schools safely open None's able to keep our schools open and the best way to do that is to use those layered prevention strategies And that includes not only vaccinating our children but and our adults But also to continue to mask certainly in the context of this type very transmissible Omocron variants has not one shred of evidence Okay, the question here was okay Rochelle lensky has over and over and over cited a bad study the Atlantic completely debunked his study There was a study that she kept citing saying that p that school children were three times more likely to get covid If there was no mask mandate that study is complete garbage. It does not work It does not use comparable control groups. It is just it's a nonsense study the Atlantic okay, not a right-wing organization the Atlantic completely Ripped that study apart. She's asked about it and her response is i'm just not even gonna cite data I'm just gonna tell you what you ought to do I mean this is this is craziness. It's craziness So they say they don't want to shut down society They say that the vaccinated should be able to lead normal lives then they're like also you should never associate with an unvax person again Also your kids must be vax also you should get boosters also you should continue to wear a mask Also, we should test the asymptomatic Joe Biden wants 500 million tests for people to test And people are lining up around the block in major cities around the united states convinced by the media They must test for omochron if they've got a sniffle This is craziness folks. It's nuts Andy slavitt former white house senior advisor on covid He's now saying that we need to push for more boosters and require booster shots We need to require booster shots not for the most vulnerable but for everyone We need to require boosters weird israel has had third shots of boosters And guess what they still have an omochron outbreak In fact, that omochron outbreak is so severe. They're now requiring fourth shots in israel You should get your punch card and if you finally get to 12 then you get a free donut It's exciting stuff happening here In in shicago lori lightfoot the complete turret of a mayor She she was suggesting quote to put it simply if you have been living vaccine free your time is up If you wish to live life As with ves to do the right things you love you must be vax This health order may pose an inconvenience to the unvaccinated and in fact it is inconvenient by design She's deliberately making your life worse if you are unvaxed And then she says she's gonna call for a vax passports the vax passports are completely useless They're useless vaccinated people are passing this new york city has had a vax passport for months at this point in a massive outbreak in new york city This is not designed to elicit the actual Result that they supposedly want which means that what is it actually designed to do maximize power and get you to signal that you've got skin In the game and that you're going to side with the cult Also exempt are any individuals entering an establishment for less than 10 minutes for the purpose of merely ordering food or drink So if you're going in that coffee shop to pick up and go You don't need to show proof But if you're gonna linger you're gonna eat that muffin You're gonna sit down with your laptop. You got to show proof Of vaccination by the way if you go into a a coffee shop and you stand in line for 10 minutes unvaccinated That is plenty of time to infect everybody around you. So obviously this is not designed to elicit a response It's designed to just pressure people That pressure is not going to be successful Meanwhile, Miguel Cardona again the education secretary insisting that masks work here is the thing N95s do work can 95s work. You know what there is no evidence works cloth face masks You know who said that leanna wenn he most hawkish person on covet it is possible to be yesterday on cnn And she said they're facial decoration that is correct your government is still providing you bad data The goal is to have students safely in the classrooms and we don't want markings No one benefits when there are quarantine parents have to leave work or Late notice the the change or schedule and we know masks prevent the spread of over 19 So when there are policies in place that prevent that I think those policies are going to come under question because it's burning Parent ability to be at work and most importantly it's hurting our students ability to be engaged with their peers and with their teachers where they learn best My god, so here's what they do They said a stupid rule that makes no sense and then to back up that rule they said about other stupid rules So the stupid rule is all kids in the class have to be masked because that's going to spread that's going to stop transmission No evidence cloth face masks stop transmission of all micron. No one Okay, then they say and if you're not masked and somebody gets Gets omochron then you have to test everybody. Why? Why? Okay, but if they're masked you don't have to test everybody So in order to shore up the lie you can't get infected by somebody with a cloth mask who is seven years old In order to shore up that lie you have to not test everybody But if they're unmasked then you have to test everybody why it's almost as though you're rigging the system in order to come up with positive tests when there are no masks It's almost as though you've created a system to redouble your data at the expense of actual data It's incredible. Do you see the trick there flying the trick is we will only look at the tests Among the unmasked but we'll never look at the test among the masked Because because we know the masks work already. You don't you haven't provided any data on this whatsoever Here's the actual solution unmask the kids leave them the hell alone. Don't test the asymptomatic if we're symptomatic go home Done just like the flu just like every other disease in the history of humankind You know where the sense this ends for the left never it ends with model citizens. Okay, so this was the model citizen on twitter yesterday You just have to show you this model citizen is a person named dana scot and dana not scully at telefeminism Hey, do you have a picture of this human? There should be a picture of this human attached to the suite. Yes, there it is All right, so If you can't see this this is why you should subscribe and watch the video This person describes flying quote. I'm flying today But I'm not effing around with amokron Check Pfizer times three check negative rapid test check natural immunity check n95 sealed to my face with surgical Tape check secondary mask for displaying opinions check face shield check vinyl gloves check touch screen gloves check leap ton of zan axe So um, this is the model citizen This this person should win the medal of honor this person is the Most important person in america this person understands amokron and this person understands how you're supposed to protect yourself just to repeat You're supposed to triple vax You're supposed to test negative You've already had covid which means you have natural immunity, but you triple vaxx anyway Then you're not only supposed to wear an n95 you're supposed to seal the n95 to your face using surgical tape But that's not enough the real key I think the real key in this description is the secondary mask for displaying your opinions That's the key because if you wear a mask that that Has a that that says vote on it, which is what this mask says then omokron definitely will leave you alone I mean we learned this during BLM last year right? I mean during BLM we learned that you could go ahead and twerk for george flood without a mask And You would never be hit by the variant ever you would never be hit by by the original variant or by dull it by anything In fact, you're immune from death so long as you are twerking for george flood This is what we learned from our scientific community last year. So she's right In fact, she's so right she could dismiss all the rest of the things she wouldn't need as long as she had a cloth face mask that said vote on it She'd be done. She'd be good to go She also has a face shield vinyl gloves touch screen gloves and bleep ton of zanax Yeah, the zanax I think is probably the key ingredient here I think that's most likely the key ingredient we have decided to panic ourselves over a variant that is essentially the common cold for the vast majority of people who get it We have decided to destroy the lives of our children on the shoals of covid panic because our government actors lied to us about what they could do and what they couldn't do That is what they've done. It is insane, but I guess they feel better about themselves ruining lives By the way, the covid hospitalizations in south africa just going to point this out They're falling They're falling already They lasted for five seconds and then they fell And to pretend that the data is is not in is ridiculous the data are in It is erictopl. Okay, who is not a wild right winger He tweeted out a study yesterday of the south african preprint data says 70 percent reduction in illness severity compared with delta and prior variants 70 percent My guess is probably higher than that But they They're going to continue they must they must continue because again, it's about the faith They're going to make a bunch of moves that restrict your life because the more you restrict your life the more virtuous you are The more restricted you are the more virtuous you are Because this is a religious practice at this point. That's all this is it is a religious practice And so you must listen to the doddering old fool in the white house telling you a bunch of contradictory things You must listen to her shovel ensky when she says you need to mask your kids You must listen to Andy slavin when he says you have to boost the unborn And you have to do all of these things despite the fact that there are countervailing arguments And by the way on boosters, Marty macKerry a friend to the show From john's opkins. He says it's actually dangerous to push boosters for teens He says booster mandates for healthy young people which some colleges are imposing will cause medical harm for the sake of transient reductions in mild and Asymptomatic infections in a study of 438,000 males 16 to 24 56 developed myocarditis after their second Pfizer dose Most cases were mild but in the broader group of 136 people who developed myocarditis seven had a complicated course 122 year old died Moderna's vaccine carries an even higher rate of heart complications Which is why some european countries have restricted it for people under 30 but in the united states the fda and cdc are indiscriminately pushing boosters for all young people Again, all of this is being done In the absence of real data suggesting that 18 year olds need a booster in the first place But once again, I will just repeat this until i'm blue in the face The goal is not to stop omochron because you can't the goal is not even to prevent death from omochron Because whatever death is going to happen is going to happen The goal is to maintain the lie that they are in control and the only reason we have failed to stop this is because of your lack of fealty They are very disappointed in your lack of faith Alrighty, we'll be back here today with an additional hour of content in the meantime, please head on over to dailywire.com slash do not comply We are very close to 1 million signatures.
