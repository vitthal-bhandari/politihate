    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucksxton show podcast Welcome in Thursday edition clay Travis bucksxton show Yes, they have Cranked up the music there buck. I am 44 years old today As an old man born in the 1970s. I know this is unbelievable for you whipper snappers out there 1979 this day 44 years ago I entered into the world thanks to my mom who is excited to share photos With alley. I think they're up on the clay and buckshow. You know what it's a lot less of a crazy world back in 1979 I'll tell you that much what was it like with your plaid pants watching mash at night after a long day at the factory? You don't even know what it was like to be alive during jimmy carter's tenure And well, maybe now you do because it's basically like joe biden's tenure right now. Uh, we've gone back in time two generations later and buck I I was last night Looking at some of the brand advertisements. We got a lot to get into by the way Uh, we appreciate all of you hanging out with us on 500 odd stations all over the country The tens of millions of you that are downloading the podcast Uh every single month. We thank you for hanging out with us I last it's It's rare buck that I watch them something these days and I just think this is even crazier than anything I could have expected And when I watched this crazy fake woman That has taken root all over tick tock and social media also known as a man Yes, yes Fake woman aka man that is getting millions of dollars now in endorsement income from some of the biggest companies in america I sit here and I look at it and I think to myself How do we get back to normalcy and if you guys haven't seen i'm sure it's going to be up on clay and buck It's certainly up on my twitter feed at clay travis Nike and budlight who are two of the biggest Probably ad spenders ever and for all of you out there listening to us right now Nike and budlight would never spend money on this radio show buck Because you and I are too controversial And the opinions that we share on this show are too controversial to be associated with beer and tennis shoes We're so nice guys. It's so I know and if you're if you're out there and you're like, I don't even know what you're talking about Let me share a quick story with you before we start playing some of this crazy audio Buck a couple of years ago. I was scheduled to get paid by jacked angels to appear in an event I'm not opposed to whiskey. I'm not opposed to alcohol. They reached out to me here in nashville where I live They said we'll pay you several thousand dollars to show up and just have a drink have a take a couple of whiskey drinks Jack daniel's local tennessee company. I was like fine. I'll do it The week before I was scheduled to go News broke that one of the schools that i'm an alum from vander built university here in nashville Was going to pay over a million dollars to sand blast the word confederate off of a building that was built in the 19th century That was called confederate memorial hall, which was designed to honor the memory of soldiers who fought for the confederacy Nobody could even see it. Nobody even knew that it said confederate memorial Hall hardly all the way at the top But they did vander built made the decision to spend over a million dollars to sand blast that word off the building And I came out and I said this to me is everything that's wrong with trying to wokify our history I disagree with it as an alum of vander built university Buck when I said that Jack daniel's canceled my endorsement Appearance and said we can no longer be affiliated with you Just for sharing my opinion that the word confederate shouldn't pay a million dollars at vander built to sand blast it off a building Now people can have whatever opinion they want on that. I don't particularly care I just think the idea that we completely erase a historically relevant issue Is a bad precedent to set no matter what the history is in general. Okay But yet jack daniels is paying all of these now transgender activists Probably hundreds of thousands of dollars if not millions to endorse their product And I think a lot of people out there are finally saying this is enough We can't stand for this anymore And when you see nike and you see the bud light move. I think people have finally had enough so so nike Has a sports bra promotion. Yes with Dylan movani. I also think this is an important moment to remember that Anybody who ever says anywhere online on tv Inline at the supermarket to you Why do you make such a big deal out of this stuff? We aren't the ones making a big deal out of it. Correct. They are the ones making a big deal out of it The left the democrats biden the white house the media they have decided that this is A crusade for them. This is something that is of the utmost social importance in the country right now It is a civil rights struggle And it it can only work if people Refuse to think for themselves and are all scared basically it can only work if a degree of mind control of of brainwashing Is effective from the apparatus itself and this is why You know, you also are a reminder clay you're talking about these different brands If you were to just sort of think about this if you hadn't spent a lot of time dealing with corporate america directly An american buying different stuff buying different brands you would assume that Budweiser And jack daniels and you know some of these brands you would think would be the least likely but based on just who is drinking beer and whiskey right who's the audience, right? Who is really into jack daniels who's drinking most of the budweiser now Also, just as a function of numbers the transgender community is very very small So they're clearly not trying to broaden the base to correct run up sales with the transgender community It's too small to make a difference to the numbers of companies like that so this is a combination of Virtu signaling of pressure, I think from government that's just always implicit government regulators You know, I I know it's a conceum a little conspiratorial, but I mean look what just happened to donald trump, right? You know, you get on the long side of the system and all of a sudden Nonsense happens to you and they try to ruin your life So for a lot of these corporations, this is just either insurance or you know kind of like social justice insurance Or I think that they are terrified of people within their ranks Who will make? Problems for them if they won't go forward with this but I mean you're selling to sports bra with a guy is what that's what they're actually Trying to do a night. Who does not have breasts. This is important if you haven't watched this video They have this dude who is pretending to be a girl And he is pretending to be let's be honest. It's womanface It's a modern day version of blackface is incredibly offensive because it's not how normal women behave But they are trinikie is selling sports bras now that they want women to purchase that A man is wearing and he has no breasts I mean in the advertisement and I just I look at it and I think to myself How much crazier can this get that they and and to your point buck if you raise an issue with this and I understand some of you By the way You say well, why would you give attention to this the goal of advertising is to get attention And I understand that on some level but to me you have to call out hypocrisy absurdity And uh and things that frankly are indefensible Even if it leads to us paying attention to an advertisement We have seen what happens when the right retreats from different battlegrounds in this country Of ideas in the culture We've seen what happens when we just Hope for a neutral space. That's always the thing that people talk about Oh, we just want we just want neutral teaching in the classroom from you know pre K all the way up the college We want a neutral space for sports teams and and sports leagues and well guess what they don't the other side doesn't and they're going to use these as tools of Politicization so you can either allow that to happen, right? You effectively give them exactly what they want which is unrestricted messaging dominance I mean if you think about it in a military context, it's like syops or information warfare If you're going to seed the battlefield to the other side entirely You're not showing them how you know smart and tough and strong you are by doing this right You're allowing them to run unrestricted information operations Marketing by the way marketing propaganda syops these things are all very similar There's a lot of connective tissue between these ideas so you can either look at this. This is cultural propaganda clay That's what the purpose of this is it's not to sell more beer. They're not going to sell more beer I would like to hear i'm going to open it up again. Women only 800-282-2882 when you see a Nike ad That is designed to sell sports bras And a man without boobs. I mean, let's just be clear This is not even a man who's had surgery to be a woman. He still has a penis and testicles He has no they have to be specific. He has no breasts, right? He is wearing a sports bra pretending to be a woman Nike is likely paying this man. I bet hundreds of thousands of dollars buck Uh in order to be in these ads trying to sell leggings which I guess allow space for women for for genitals now for for penis and testicles And a sports bra without having breasts like how insulting Is this to women like I watch it and I just think if I were a woman I would be so thoroughly disgusted that Nike is actually paying a man To pretend to be a woman to sell women's athletic gear to me I think the only response you can have if you are a woman listening to us right now is say I will refuse to buy any Nike gear. This is crazy And I think it's important to note that it also is coming From the white house folks. This is not us beating up on some, you know small or even you know large like sorrows funded A non fake non-profit that does propaganda against the right or something This goes top to bottom. This is all the way across the spectrum Here is karee jon pia in the white house on the issue of transgender Surgery and gender and uh hormone blocking for minors does the president have a position on? At what age these kinds of therapies and surgeries are appropriate That's something for a child and and their parents to decide it's not something we believe Uh should be decided by by legislators. There's such cowards play There's such cowards because this is actually what they did on covid too They're gonna say we leave it to the experts But they're actually going to legislate and push for it and whenever they get pushed back They say hey, we're just leaving it to the experts and then any expert who says this is mutilation of children Will lose their license. This is the game. They play it's totally dishonest and also Legislatures and politicians are involved in a massive amount of laws, right? We say you can't get a beer until you're 18 years old a parent doesn't get to say The yeah, sorry It's 21. I don't know how it is in tennessee Sorry, sorry, sorry. I lived in the virgin I haven't found out there in Nashville area still 18 there. Hey, i'm on to college campuses a lot There's a lot of fake ideas out there. Um, the uh, the other thing is the um, you know, yes You have to be 18 years old to vote Uh, that is a legislature based decision You have to be 25 by and large to rent a car Most states will not allow you to get a tattoo until you're 18 age of consent Is a variety of different ages, but you can't say hey This 12 year old wants to sleep with this 35 year old her parents say it's okay We're going to be fine with it There are lots of things that legislators make decisions on to me The idea that you could chop off someone's breasts or take away their genitals Before they're 18 years old and the white house would be saying We don't think it's appropriate for legislatures to our politicians to get involved in this issue Is flagrantly indefensible and I can't imagine hardly any parent in america who agrees with it I have to I have to say this because I do understand The the extremes of what the left is really trying to accomplish and where they're trying to go They're focused on your kids for all of you across the country The reason they want to focus on children here as part of the transgender agenda is twofold one They are this is why they say that doctors get it wrong with babies They are trying to create the narrative of this is a from birth condition Effectively that this is something it is an immutable transgenderism is an immutable characteristic that Develops at some later, you know at 50 or whatever. That's what they're trying to say though Right, that's one part of that's why they want it to be. Oh, this is your transgender from birth That's one and the other is they want to be Able to claim that the transitions are more complete by blocking puberty and destroying normal Reproductive organs in young people because then they think they'll be closer to be able to say well biologically They're not really male either Biologically this person is some is you know some but but what they're remember the ultimate claim is not that denhamal vaney is a transgender Woman that you know, okay. I could you could call her trans jet call him a transgender woman fine It is that it is a woman Indestinishable from all other women which is crazy. Yeah, that is their actual claim.

Weighed in a moment ago on the transgender children issue, but npr has lost its blue check on twitter national public radio and also clay was slapped with a state media label Here is what the white house said about this the hard hitting independence nature of their coverage speaks Speaks were itself and so i'll leave it there first of all no one thinks npr is hard hitting That's the last thing you'd ever think about npr like you got to be kidding me and it is state media Guess what if you don't want taxpayer funded dollars to support you then do away with taxpayer dollars And just uh say you're not going to take them anymore I'll also point out that npr put out frankly A statement that said we're not going to cover the hunter biden story because we don't want to waste our audiences time Certainly very interesting how the state sponsored media ends up covering the biden administration if they're not state sponsored How about not being state sponsored?

She had a really good tweet That she put out there and I feel like she speaks for many different women. She's doing good work force at out kick amber harding Uh yesterday after this uh ridiculous nikey ad started to circulate and obviously coming on the heels of the bud light ad that is effectively Erasing women. Um she tweeted out and I think there's a lot of women out there that would agree with this um uh day 12 because the big thing that this dillin movaney character does is He's been on tick tock counting each day that he's been a woman and he's only been a woman for like a year or whatever it is Uh and she tweeted amber harding snider. Sorry. She just got married Uh day 12,482 of being a woman and not one corporate sponsorship yet What am I doing wrong and uh, I feel like there's a lot of women out there who feel the same way Michelle in alabama Uh, you're a retired army vet when you see this Thing people trying to sell sports bras to women by putting men in sports bras who have no boobs I mean, what do you think? I think it's horrible absolutely horrible. I have we have four children two boys two girls And the girls were somewhat tomboys, but never in my waffle streams nor my husband's if we ever think that they needed to be Trans-agendered I mean, you know, I feel bad for women today. I feel bad for the young girls coming up behind us even our military women because now they're going to be competing With men who want higher scores like on their PT test. They just identify as a woman So do that does that mean that they get to you know run with those scores? Get higher promotion points Michelle it's it's it's not fair and and thank you for calling in. I would just say show clay um womanhood is Uh in a in a healthy society, which I think ours was healthier before the last 10 years or so No, womanhood is a Revered thing and you and I as as guys you married a long time me married a short time I understand that a lot of what we do as guys is in reverence of and To appeal to womanhood It's a it's a special thing, you know to be a woman in in society is Something that has to be you know nurtured protected revered respected And to just make honestly make a mockery of it in this way Is is absurd? I mean, I'm sure you saw the matt wall Uh exchange right it's gotten millions of views with a transgender emt And he asked the question about and there are variations on those people have been asking for for years now But if somebody said that they were having a miscarriage, but you know, it's a guy Are you gonna check them for a miscarriage? Yeah, and the emt says no and you know credit to matt wall shut the daily wire for the exchange um, but You know, there still is this belief people say like well, you can't even tell you can tell actually Yeah, I mean, it's not even just into the theoretical and the wall be polite to people They'll say well you can't tell that you can tell that it's a guy So why do they keep lying to you because their arguments are terrible Nancy in road island your reaction To say that, um, this is nothing new in the fashion industry Um, i'm 59 years old and I grew up, you know getting vogue magazine every month And since their early 80s starting in early probably even before that The women that would model calvin cline and new new and all that were very unrealistic bodies for women Anyways, they're real thin. They have no brass. They have no hips and they have graduated from that to just having men in the print ads wearing the dressings So what nance what nancy's talking about. I mean clay. There are people who call there will there are people who say that Uh the fashion industry which is not necessarily, uh, you know How do I put this that the fashion industry was pushing for androgyny a long time ago? Based on who was set now not across the board but high fashion and this has been Uh creeping into it and becoming more and more mainstream for a while Um, but I don't really see necessarily i'm not really sure what the connection is here between Look what I would say on healthy skinny models and transgenderism. Yeah, what I would say is there is certainly the case that Beautiful women who were supermodels had not normal bodies. All right, I don't think she was referring to Not normal as in in the app, you know winning the genetics lottery Yeah, there were there were times when there were there were models who were They were thin to the point where it was clear they had eating disorders things like that Yeah, right, but but you know like you use victoria secret for a for an example when we were Growing up for as victoria secret became a dominant brand Their brand was we want hyper Incredibly good looking women. I've made this analogy for a long time buck Uh, the jazelle buncheons of the world. Let's just use her as an example are like nba drappic She won the genetics lottery. They won the genetics lottery. There just aren't very many people like them And now if you go walk like I don't it's not like i'm in the mall very often if you walk by victoria secret They just have kind of a fat chick in a bra there was a there was a whole time a transgender people like now selling the clothes there was a whole um Documentary on netflix actually about abracrombie And how abracrombie was effectively destroyed by the woke or I should say transformed. I would argue destroyed by the woke social justice movement Um because they said that you know it was What was it it was too beautiful? There are too many straight people and too many white people that was the Uh, that was the attack on it and eventually the whole brand effectively caved I mean, I don't think anyone wears that I think it still exists, but it's a it's a You know, I use more fraction back in the day. Uh, did you know this at abracrombie at the uh while I was in college You worked at abracrombie. I worked at abracrombie. They only lol excuse me sir Look at that work at the pentagon city for anybody out in the dc area the pentagon city mall I would hop on the subway from gw where I was an undergrad And I would go work at the pentagon city abracrombie my you know my wife carrey worked at abracrombie too And he's like the best best most one of the most fun jobs I ever had I worked at abracrombie and american eagle I asked her I said oh we're the other employees. Yes.

I believe murder in san francisco of that uh, silicon valley founder founder of cash app bob lee Melissa in north carolina. You've got some thoughts for us. What's going on? Melissa Hey, buck. Um, no, I was just telling your callers So, you know, my first thought was it's insulting, um to women that you know Somebody can just put on a headband and a lily poulter dress And call themselves a woman and everybody says hey, she's a woman But then the other thing is the fact that you know this person Taking a job actual biological woman Correct, and you know, we say We say that women have made such strides. We have international women's day and women's month But yet it seems like we're going backwards now. We have men that are taking jobs from women again Because they're wearing a bathing suit and they called themselves a female Or they put some earrings on and lipstick and called themselves a female And if you say no, they're not a female. They're a male wearing a dress or a bathing suit Then people look at you like you're crazy and you know act like you've just insulted them and it's sad because If people wearing the bathing suits and wearing the lipstick Have obvious mental illnesses or issues that need to be addressed not cater to yeah. Yeah, I think I think I was gonna say can I just cosign I mean I think she's completely correct. I mentioned I just want to give a Give everyone a chance to hear it because this has gone very viral You know matt wall sh did the movie what as a woman which is it is excellent We had him on the show to talk about it. Here is his exchange at a college with a transgender EMT play it you said you're an EMT Yes, okay if you're responding you're responding to a health emergency Biological male somebody with a penis is uh is having a medical emergency and they say to you um, I think I'm having a miscarriage Would you would you check them to see if they're having a biscuit would you consider that a possibility for them? No, but That's because some people don't have body parts I mean this is and you know there was also and as part of his discussion he pointed out, you know If you if you find somebody Who has lost a leg from either an accident or or illness or or war or whatever it may be? It doesn't mean that it's untrue to say that human beings have two legs correct And yet this so much of the argument they they put forward here Is it just runs in circles? There's no actual formation to the argument. It's emotion masquerading as an argument VIP email by the way from andrea Um, I find and this is her. I'm reading her VIP email I find it interesting the only time the left celebrates white men Is when they're pretending to be women Is so true right the ultimate white privilege you can argue white male privilege I said this about the lea tama situation You have a rich white guy who is a swimmer that is at the university of pennsylvania How much more privilege can you get than to decide hey? I'm tired of being a college male swimmer I'm just going to become a woman swimmer and you're one of the greatest women of all time Got a castle point out how how emotionally unhealthy do you have to be? You know if I jumped in on a first graders dodge ball game and was wasting kids left and right I wouldn't be saying yeah, I'm amazing at dodge ball. I would know that there was something wrong with this mismatch He thought it was fine to win the nc double a give me a break That's why I also pointed out that kid who pretended that he was 14 years old in the little league world series Everybody lost their mind over lying about age genders. Okay?"
