    "text": " Today, the city of McAllen, Texas says the Biden administration released more than 7,000 COVID positive migrants into the community. But definitely you need to be mandated to take a vaccine guys. Also, CNN tracks down in corners a Florida doctor that is on the White House list of the 12 disinformation pushers. We've got a fun one today and it starts right now. Hey, happy Friday. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Saragans all is today joined by Blaise TV contributor, Yaku Buiyan's host of the Yaku Buiyan's show. Also in the house, Sydney Watson. And I mean, let's be real. Her dog Murphy, who if this is why you guys have to watch also and not just listen, this is the cutest freaking thing I've ever seen in my life. So Murphy is joining us today. He will be commentating as well. He well, he has lots to say he and his egg head. Oh my God, even right now, he's just like, I love this studio. Let me eat all the equipment. The baby baby Irish Sutter. So he's the cutest thing ever. He very much is. And it's Friday. So we're just doing it. He may end up on the table later. I don't really know. I'm just gonna let him run rampant. It's gonna show he if you're okay with it, I'm totally fine with it. I am absolutely fine with that. Also joining us, Eric July, Blaise TV contributor as well and host of for Canon's sake, which you can find at his YouTube channel, which is young Ripa 59, which he is never changing. It's never gonna be old Ripa. No, no, funny. I was on Michael Michael and host today and he said, he said he was young, we're about 58. He said that's why I had to use 59. So that's what he said. It's what Michael said. That's so funny. Yeah, insider information there. That's really funny. For every young. Yes. I can't age. For everyone on Twitter. Maybe you're the vampire in this equation. Did you just say even when I'm 40? Even when I'm 40. That's young. I got to smack this boy. We're gonna get him a major mistake. That's funny. That's right. I started off all right. Fantastic for you. You gotta need to be the fantastic seven. All right. Well, we're off to an explosive start here at the table. Let's go through the headlines. So the city of McAllen, Texas said that since mid February, US Customs and Border Production released more than 7,000 illegal immigrants. Now this is obviously the numbers of just released illegal immigrants are way more. This is just the COVID positive confirmed COVID-19 cases into their community. That's including more than 1500 new cases in just the past week. Now this comes again, I alluded to it earlier at a time where you see New York City earlier this week came out and they're mandating vaccination. They're pushing for mandatory vaccines to basically enter public establishments right indoor restaurants, gyms, eateries. And then you saw LA come out and do the same type of thing while at least they're pushing for it. So you have the left pushing for these vaccine passports, pushing for you guys to never leave your homes again, pushing for masks to be on children and schools, be all these things because COVID is so deadly. COVID is so scary. We have to get control of this awful pandemic. There are people dying in the streets. Oh, except they're releasing literally releasing COVID thousands of COVID positive migrants, illegal immigrants into the community. You can't write this better if you tried. No, this is Dr. Evil. This is he's buying this is like the super villain who's in charge and all of a sudden, you know, supervillain took over Gotham City. This is what's going on here. I mean, and they just run a muck. I mean, there's no logic. This is what I want to do. I just want to have this series of like intense debates, line them up all of them. Start with Newsom because I want to take that guy down and then you bring the Cuomo's into Blasio and then you bring Sippic up, you line him up. And I just want to have general logical questions. Simple questions. Does it make sense, Uncle Joe, that we release 7,000 COVID positive people at the same time you're telling America, duck because you're all going to die? Does it make sense? And I just want to watch them squirm on live television and squeal and this suck for air and hope some whole swallow them because there's no answer that can justify zero. But then again, nobody holds them accountable other than the Sarah show in Blas, you know, they never being held accountable for anything. I'm going to you know what? I think that should be the new name of this show. Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, I like that works for me. I think it goes off the tongue way better than the current title. I'm just saying. Well, you're here first. This is like, oh my, there's a dog on the onset. What's going on? All these crazy things are happening now. Sarah's yelling about changing the name. All right, let's just do it. Send it. Let's go. Okay, so really back to this. Like, I just, I can't imagine that even their own people are believing this crap. But then I read Twitter, which I know I have to remind myself it is not representative of real life. Twitter is not representative of real life. Twitter is not representative of real life. But it feels that way sometimes and you see all of these people who are still scared, who are still acting like it's the end of the world. And it's like, bro, your guy is releasing COVID positive people. That's how seriously he takes the pandemic. Your guy is picking stuff off of his face and eating it. That's how seriously he takes the presidency. I mean, yeah, no, at the end, I mean, I'm sort of in agreement with all of you guys, I think, on this where it's like, I see this is just at this point, one giant scyop. It's like, really, what's going on behind the scenes if this is what you're drawing our attention to? Yeah. You know, for every one thing that the government actually says, how many other things are going on that we don't hear about? So how much worse is this actually? I don't know, I find it all kind of ironic that it's like they make such sounds about how bad COVID is, you know, oh, hell, the hospitals are getting overwhelmed again, mind you while they're laying off staff, they won't get vaccinated. What's that all about? You're really so overwhelmed. And then, you know, by the same token, then you have all these illegal immigrants. And I hate the people called them migrants. Can I just say that? I know every single story that I get on my note card, it always says migrants. And I always have to correct it because I'm reading it. And I'm like, this is, they're not migrants. No, it's this, like semantics, language changing thing that the left does. It makes us sound less, less important than it actually is. They're illegal immigrants. They're illegal aliens. Let's call a spade. And what bothered me about all this is I think, you know, you're punishing the American people simultaneously, letting in all these people into the country who have the propensity to pass on a virus that you think is so bad. And here we all sit in lockdown with our masks on basically, like, you know, sucking our thumbs because we're children, we're fantillized at this stage. And the government doesn't care. I don't know. I'm becoming an anarchist, but else can I say? I know. I feel like you're really resonating with it. Amen. I'm gonna have the entire Blaze studio going for that and cap. Everybody. Yes. Just say how many times have I said to you, Eric, this is like your time. Yeah. This is your moment. The last year and a half has just been has just been a short, every single day that the news, like whatever news stories happen. I feel like every single day for the last year and a half, Eric's been like, I've been trying to tell you guys this for the last freaking decade. Decade, man. No, I was listening now. You guys are really figuring it out. There's so many different ways. I put it in a song. I put it in a YouTube video. I'd be telling all these people and then it blows up in people's face over the last year and folks are like, okay, they're like, you know, what sounds great. Decentral is it? Yeah, exactly. But you guys, but this is the same angle. I know that a lot of people are gonna say, well, they may or may not have been quarantined for X amount of time. If they had test positive, what it boils down to is the idea that still being within that community are people that are testing positive for this apocalyptic virus. Well, let them tell it. That's what it is. So, of course, people have a right to look at that and be upset because you're treating these sort of different groups of people way differently than what you are the folks that are already within this geographical area known as the United States of America that have been living here. So, we look at that now different a little bit in Texas, but let's assume that you're in New York City or somewhere like that and you see something like that in which these people treat it as if it's basically a death sentence, is what the virus essentially is. Let them tell it. And you see something like that happening. Like maybe it isn't as dangerous as what it is that they have been saying that it was. I don't know. Maybe that's always been certainly the case. They get to be continuously hypocritical on it. The CDC even had to concede. What was it early was the last week or the early this week? Can't really remember in which they're saying, okay, well, out there in Massachusetts, looks like a vast majority of those people that have tested positive during this supposed outbreak were vaccinated. Fully vaccinated. Yeah, fully vaccinated. That ain't partially whoops. So all that stuff that they had been saying about the unvaccinated being the reason why this pandemic continues to extend. It doesn't look like that was that true. But that's the grim side of it is that it does look like they're going to get away with it despite being so hypocritical and all their affable be the CDCs of the world and I age of the world. They get to basically contradict themselves and they get to fall back on. Well, the science changed. Right. Right. Of course, the science changed. We can't provide the data to back up that the science changed. But if we say the science change, we are the science. So we can just tell you that and it's totally fine. By the way, Biden's amazing plan to stop COVID-19 at the border is definitely not to just like shut the border down and, you know, like enforce the actual laws that are on the books. It's just to vaccinate the illegal immigrants before they release them into your cities and towns. Like you like you can stop a virus. Like you can actually stop a virus. Like the virus has, you know, a little anchor bracelet on and it bites by geography and zip code and it doesn't just. Well, it does. We all know Yahoo that it doesn't strike when you're doing a Black Lives Matter protest or riot or some other social justice. It's Friday. So I'm going to go somewhere that I really want to go. Okay. I want to go somewhere. I want to talk about what's really sometimes you just need to ask a question and the amazing Blaise viewers run with it, right? What's really going on? That's what I want to know. What's really because this is obviously look at my left hand so you don't see what I'm doing with the right hand, right? So I want to know where's the cabal? What are they doing? What does the deep say doing? Who's pulling the strings? I want to start asking the real question because Biden is a puppet. Okay. Harris has fallen off the wagon. So I want to, I want us to go back and say, where are the Clintons at the moment? What are they doing? What's Obama doing? What strings are he pulling? Oh boy, he's having parties. He's having seven on TV. No, no, but he's pulling a lot of strings. I want to get into Soros. I'm going to say I want to get into George Soros and he's underling the year me today that's being groomed to be Dr. Evil and that's Gates. I want to know where Gates is. I want to see who's connected. Let's go back to AZT, the drug, the age drug that Fauci took to Africa that killed me. It's spread AIDS that they had to cancel bringing it here. Let's go dig up some bodies. I'm in that spirit right now. I'm going to fight in the spirit. I want to fight. I want to pick a fight. Let's dig those things up and call Fauci for what he is. The guy that's been responsible for millions, millions dying over multiple drugs. Who's he funded by? Who funded to one lab? You know, let's go ask those questions as conservatives. Let's go dig up some bodies. Do you feel like getting suicited because I feel like that's where that goes? No. Do you want to be hanging from a tree? I got the hand of God on me and I'm telling you what I've learned about it, bully, when I was seven. You smash him in the mouth. They're cowards. They're cowards. You know when they run you over? When you approach the fight hesitantly, when you go half almost said a word. It's fine. Halfway, right? Uh, Murph is like, he's not appreciating his language. He's not fighting the two. We need to go on the off and start public. The barbecue this weekend start asking your friends these questions. What's really going on? Let's start a real interrogation, investigation into these top 300 families and start asking real questions. What's really going on? Who's pulling the strings? Why? Right? Because it doesn't make sense. I'm in that mood now. I'm like, okay, my grandpa said, hey, you pick up a shovel. You're going to find something. Let's pick up a shovel. Let's go dig. All right. Let's assemble the army. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not mocking you by the way. I'm not. I'm on board. I'm on board. Step. Step with me. Step out of the way. This is where I've been for ages. I'm like, let's go. Let's assemble an army. Let's go. Let's go. Just let's go. Come on. Come on. Logic. Well, I will say this. I do think that it's a sad state of affairs when I hear on the news earlier this week, Sydney. I think that we talked about this the other day about the I there was just another news story that one of the capital officers involved in the yeah, in the January 6th hubbub committed suicide. And that was what the fourth? Yeah, the fourth one. And I was like, it doesn't sound right to me, right? I'm immediately skeptical of all of these like they've all happened within the last what couple months or something. And I'm like, that doesn't sound right. I'd love to hear more information on that. And then, you know, you get called a conspiracy theorist and all these things. But I'm like, well, I think it says less about me and more about the fact that we know that all of these crazy things are going on in the government. And that's where like, because I feel like I'm a there I'm a reasonable person. I'm not a crazy person. If that's where my mind goes, it's not because I'm crazy. It's because they're constantly gaslighting us and lying to us and telling us that we're the crazy ones. That's how the government has historically operated. So I mean, unfortunately, when when you're dealing with like the institutions, you see, and seeing as other world ABCs of the world, people that are basically state propagandists anyway, the only legitimate information is the information that comes from them. So yeah, you're right. If you bring something like that up, which is bizarre, it's very bizarre. That's not a normal thing. That's not something that happens from a situation like this, even just the the foundational concept of what happened around January 6 for the most part was a complete lie. And if you bring it up, it's like, well, they say this FBI CIA, whoever whatever alphabet didn't come they didn't confirm that. Therefore, you must be talking out of your behind. There's no way that something like that could be true. So it is textbook gaslighting because they have you questioning whether or not you're the same. And as you see something like that happening, and you're like, well, that doesn't make sense. And that doesn't align with the reality at all. Right. All right, we've got more to come. First, we want to thank our sponsor though, Bonner Wines. So it's Friday. It's about to be happy hour. And I got to tell you, if you enjoy wine like I do, and you're tired of drinking the like boring $10 grocery store bottles, you have to try this extreme altitude wine from our friends over at Bonner. This comes from the mountains of Argentina. And they grow these grapes at like 9,000 feet. And it is like, you think to yourself, whoa, what difference does that do? You have to try it for yourself. Okay, these grapes make such an amazing wine. So amazing. In fact, that we had to stop selling this a while back because it was flying off the shelves so quickly that we were like, we, they were like, we don't have any in stock. We can't like, let's just hold off until we get more in because the people loved it so much. By the way, there are no dyes, no flavor additives, less sugar than your average wine. So you can see that you're doing it for your health, which is what I like to do every Friday and Thursday and Wednesday and then Monday and Tuesday as well. So did I mention Saturday and Sunday? Every day is a good day for Bonner wine. You got to go over to cowgirlwine2021.com. If you go over there right now, they've got 50% off of the wine and 50% off of the shipping. By the way, my husband, who is not a wine drinker, he just had to, he had a procedure done and he couldn't drink anything cold. And he had the wine and he was like, this is really good. You're not kidding. I know. I don't lie about these things. All right, go over there right now. Get 50% off the wine and 50% off the shipping only at cowgirlwine2021.com. CNN in just just epic levels of journalism these days, they're trying to go after these 12 disinformation spreaders, right? So the White House published this list a while back of, actually, I'm not sure that they published the list, but they've been alluding to it every once in a while. They say that they have a disinformation dozen, which is the group of 12 people that researchers, this is what they say at the White House, researchers say are responsible for 65% of anti vaccine content on social media. By the way, I'd like for you to understand that anti vaccine to them just means asking questions, asking for data to be provided, asking why do I need to get some sort of a one size fits all solution for a virus that I am not likely to have any negative, you know, long term effects from that makes you anti vaccine these days. Okay, so there's this disinformation dozen specifically, Dr. Joseph Merkola, who is in Fort Myers, Florida. I know he runs a big website and he is very into holistic natural remedies for many things. But he did some really bad things you guys he he told people the vaccines can be dangerous. He said that vitamins C and D can help treat or prevent coronavirus. And he also said that masks sometimes don't work. So I'm just saying if anyone deserves to be in jail for the rest of their lives, it's definitely Dr. Merkola or not. But CNN decided to track him down. They showed up at his office and then asked when he would be back and then decided to drive 200 miles to his house, where they didn't find him, but then spotted him over over yonder and then decided to hunt him down there and ask him questions about whether or not he feels responsible. The whole thing is so bizarre that they thought that this was a good look. Here it is. We first tried to find him at his office in Cape Coral, Florida, outside Fort Myers. I'm looking for Dr. Joseph Merkola. It's not here. Is he is he here today? Can I leave a message? He's not here. Will he be here tomorrow if not today or? No, he's not normally not here. So even though his office is listed here, he's not he doesn't work out of here. No. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Next stop more than 220 miles away Ormond Beach, Florida, which Dr. Merkola calls us. We found his house behind a large gate and tried making contact through the security access pad. Hello, this is Randy K from CNN. I'm hoping to get a word with Dr. Merkola. Later, we spotted Joseph Merkola riding his bicycle. Once he stopped, we thought this was our opening to get some answers as to why he's pushing false claims about masks and the vaccine. How are you? I'm Randy K with CNN. Can we ask you a couple questions? We just want to talk to you about vaccines and what you've been saying about them. Do you feel responsible for people who didn't get vaccinated? Possibly got sick and died because of what you told them about the vaccine? What do you say to families who lost loved ones? Are you spreading misinformation? Why won't you speak to us? Yes. Gee. Here's your opportunity to speak with us and answer questions. I wonder why he's not speaking with them. I wonder it's a shocker to me that he wouldn't speak to a group, a camera group, a videographer, a producer probably, and some dumb lady on a microphone who's hunting you down trying to ask you gotcha questions about why you did such horrible things like tell people that sometimes vaccines can be dangerous. Sometimes masks don't work. And by the way, maybe you should treat your body right and you know, ingest vitamins to make yourself healthier so you can find out freaking illnesses. You know how cool it is. The doctor that says listen, let's live right, let's exercise, let's be holistic. Where do they find him on a bicycle? Yeah, I know. Working out. Getting some eating some vitamin D. Right? Actually, actually drinking the cool late that he's selling, right? We need more of those people in this country. I wouldn't spend two seconds talking to a woman when you're a pit bull. Okay. And a little fox derrier walks up. You don't flinch. You walk right by. That's what he did. He's like, CNN? Nah, not worth my time. I'm working out. I'm beating COVID on my bicycle. Can I tell you the other day? I had to scroll so far. I was like, I wonder if CNN has anything about Andrew Cuomo on their website. This was front and center, right? But the other day I went and I had to scroll all the way to the bottom on my cell phone to be able to find anything about Cuomo. And even then it was like not using women. Now you want to know why that is? Right. Yeah. Because they were too busy putting stories of 12 year olds leading letters, reading letters on their website. That's why. Did you see that where that little girl was reading a letter saying, I want to wear a mask to school, please. Okay, daddy, stop. They're learning early. Okay, daddy governments. Please let me put the mask on. Yeah. Yeah. Only 10 year old brother, he can't get vaccinated. He was too mass to school. This is my advantage. And the speech is by the way. This is my interpretation of your kids who just defend everyone in one sitting. Incredible. Yeah. Yeah. So it's like that's what they're covering and the harassing men at the beach that are like, Hey, lady, you're short with your, you know, yucky Karen haircut. Get away from me. I mean, it's incredible. I'm like, you guys don't have anything better to do than hunt down this man who is trying to promote healthy living in America at a time, by the way, where like everyone is sick and unhealthy. And that is why the virus did such damage in this country. It's so bizarre. Yeah. Like you mentioned, that they thought that was kind of a good look. And then the setup question was just insane. Like this whole idea like he himself is responsible because someone didn't get vaccinated. And then they ultimately die. Like what in the world? Like that? That was like a bizarre setup. Like you're telling me you're an irrational person. And I'm certainly not obligated to try to have some sort of honest conversation when you're approaching the conversation. This honestly, you're under no requirement. That's the exact setup that the like the American authoritarian left. That's how they operate. They want you constantly on the defense. They'll straw man your position. And they'll certainly gaslight you and you are no requirement to respond or defend yourself to someone's nonsensical claims. But as always CNN likes to deem anything to the contrary of what the state says as misinformation. Like what you mentioned, there's nothing necessarily irrational about that. And this is funny how I guess they're just now kind of discovering that, oh, there's doctors in America that don't say you need to get the vaccine. My own doctor, hopefully they don't hunt them down after watching the show. But my own doctor, this is the same thing. It's like, well, you're healthy. You work out every day. You take your vitamin D, you take your zinc, you're generally going to be fine. Even if you do end up getting it, you're not going to get hospital. There are risk factors to consider. Right. That's with anything else. Right. That's just kind of how we operated in life long before this. But that's the problem with the conversation is that anything deemed opposite of them is misinformation or disinformation. Meanwhile, this is the most important part. Meanwhile, they can contradict themselves and be wrong. Like they were again with how this delta virus is a variant is spreading. They literally were wrong. I need America to understand that the CDC flat out came out and admitted, okay, we got it wrong. We got it wrong. It's not spreading by will. Just the unvaccinated from all studies. It shows that when terms of this viral load, whether you vaccinated or unvaccinated, it's the same. So he got it wrong. But that's okay. And by the way, the but the solution to that is to get more vaccinated. So young Ripper, young Ripper by the seeing in brainwave that they had to drive 220 miles and tell you his house is behind it. Gate. Like no wonder because creeps like you were coming up. She'd be a gate and a shotgun. Little second amendment, but young Ripper by that logic, we can now go to the president in the United States and say, do you feel responsible for killing Americans for letting unvaccinated people with COVID come across the border? Yeah. Let's go ask the big gate. The White House. Yeah. I mean, if they were that like rigorous, I mean, they would actually be uncovering a lot of stuff. If they had did that to like, I don't know other government employees or trying to track them down at their houses saying how they actually be. The Texas Democrats frying the decision. Yeah. There's a long list of people that have been notably corrupt that they aren't seeming to ask those questions to. But God forbid, an actual doctor doesn't just say, you need to line it up and get the jab. Well, we can't have that. There has to be some sort of you spreading misinformation. Like dude, this guy has just as much of the like the requirements of them. So become the credentials, all of that, that the other guys you tell us to listen to does, he just can't comes to a different conclusion, which that often happens in this field is just unfortunately with you guys, if it didn't come from the public ones, the one that you know, they're paid for by way of stealing from us, those guys, well, it's the appeal to authority. It's legit if they said now that doctor from Florida with the Sanquere dentist, you can't go around telling people that they can't get valid. They don't have to get vaccinated. Take vitamin D, are you crazy? As you go right on your bike and exercise and you older, but you're fit. You can't go sand stuff crazy stuff like that. That's insane. Yeah, we'd rather tell people to get vaccinated and look up for hamburgers and donuts. Yes. And of course, lock down the gyms in the process. But we'll leave McDonald's open exactly. Exactly. It takes their face. Makes total sense. All right, we got to take a break. We'll be back. God, it just kills me. I just love you. We're just over here still talking about dogs. We could have a whole, here's my plan. Here's my plan. Okay, I want to hear it. Everyone gets an Irish setter like Murphy, who's off to the side eating a pig's ear right now. And then what we do is then we build an army of them and then we train them to get our enemies. He's got to work in right? Right? Well, with your plan, this is our move. That'll work really well with your plan. You're going to see me. I'm going to shoot a picture. You're going to see me like like big John Henry walking with a shovel on my shoulder. That's I'm going to send you that picture. Yeah, but you're going to have a really with a dog behind you. Exactly. Exactly. I'm ready to fight. I just want to pet the puppy. That's right. That's right. Beautiful. Murphy can only kill ears, not people. He's not that well-trained. Yes. Yes. All right. So the Orange County Board of Education announced plans to sue Gavin Newsom, who I know Yaku Yu said earlier is your favorite. Come on for you, buddy. Come on for you, buddy. In the country over the state's indoor mask mandate for kindergarten through 12th grade students attending public schools for the upcoming year, the board voted four to zero during the closed session in favor of filing the suit. So they say Newsom has abused his authority by indefinitely continuing to issue health edicts under a state of emergency. It's interesting because you mentioned what's going on in California. I know you've said it previously how you go there and people in California, even those crazy people have had enough. It is really interesting that Newsom continues to do this even in the midst of getting recalled. You would have thought that his opportunity to learn, oh, wait, maybe I've taken it too far was then and it just seems that the left never learns. They just continue to double down on this. That's a sign of how far he is over the cliff right. And it's interesting because we're talking about the California State School Board, which is not conservative. I'm working with them at the moment working because they complained because he signed by executive order comprehensive sex ed into California. Never gave the school board a chance to vote on it. So he has historically done really, really bad things for children. Look at State Bill 145, House Bill 2218. These things where three-year-olds can get puberty blockers and these kind of things. So this time the school board is saying, sorry, thank you, but no thank you. So again, just like Nancy Pelosi asking for Cuomo to leave, when a California State School Board, which is very liberal, goes against their own governor saying, hey, you're no way, buddy. Then you need to know how bad it really is. So good for them. Good for the school board saying enough is enough. I mean, I just wanted you to do another impression of American children. Oh, Danny. Well, I mean, so where do you know where these I never saw this video? Where was the kid from? So I go on goodness. I literally was just talking about this earlier. I actually cannot remember. I think it might have been in Florida. It might have been in Florida. Yeah, I don't believe it. It's the American version of Greta. Yeah, I just don't believe it for a second that children want. No, it was this little girl who wrote a letter to her county, like her school board county, whatever. I don't know what that is. Basically saying, I'm so so. I is D. Yes, there you go. I don't have children. These things escape me. So I have this I have a fair one now. But she basically said, yeah, like I need masks instituted at my school because, you know, whatever, and it was quite a long document. It looked like I didn't know kids could write that much little earned spell that made me I'm impressed. It's almost like, it's almost like, wrote it. It's very poetic. Finally, through her. Yeah. Yeah. I imagine using a child to send a message. Wow. Weird. I mean, everybody in the clip had masks on double masks. In fact, and I was very impressed. I thought I just love it. How you can spear this much even though I'm doing your face. That's remarkable. Did you get it in your mouth again after you're speaking with them? How's it going? What's up? I know they hate me when I swear on this show. I'm sorry, producer overlords. Just bleep it. You'll be fine. Eric. I mean, I know I feel about public schools, man. And it is interesting because like you said, these guys are leftist. And it's not even like that they're blatantly that probably went along with a lot of what he was doing early on until it extended for just a little bit too long. I mean, it's Orange County. Right. So they would be the most conservative. Yes, true. I mean, but by like, but still, if you're filing a law, get them in metric like a leftist in California, a person that's considered conservative in California is still like a leftist. I mean, but I get it. You know, I certainly understand the frustration. But what people need to understand is that this is the system that they've allowed, not just with him, but of course with him, that they've allowed to exist. It's no turning back on that. And this is what America doesn't seem to understand with, especially their federal government, that they give them this right. And obviously the state government is this the fact that nobody thought it was crazy that a governor could just add us a executive order. Bam. All the all the shutdown, you can't work unless you're essential. And if you're only essential, if you're on this list that I put you on. And nobody looks around like, maybe this guy shouldn't have this much power to do this to impact my individual life, despite me not even liking this guy, or even knowing who he is. He doesn't know anything about me. And then with Newsome, which is hilarious, you know, we know he's been caught doing this thing with, you know, unbacks, having dinners, doing that type of thing. This is what they're leads get to do. They lecture you and they do the opposite of what they're telling you to do. But this is how you get to that point. So people need to start actually looking at how did you contribute to the system it is that you have right now? It's too late once it blows up in your face. So I want to I want to go back to Yaku you mentioned puberty blockers earlier. We're talking about, you know, California and the sex at curriculum and all of these things. I want to talk about something that is happening having to do with that in Texas of all places. Actually the Dallas area we've covered it on the show before. It is Jeff Younger, who is a father of two twins. One of them, his ex wife, is basically trying to transition, right? We've talked about it. They call her, they call him Luna. The dad has said, hey, when he's with me, he very clearly wants to be a boy. He's happy with me living as a boy. Every time he goes back to the mom, the mom says he wants to be a girl and I'm transitioning him into a girl. Well, they've been involved in court for the last what over a year and a half, I think, several years now it's been. The court finally, they brought their verdict and in Texas of all places, the judge awarded the ex wife, the mother, George Jorgoulas exclusive control over the child's primary residence, counseling, medications, education and extracurricular activities. The father now, who was fighting to not transition his child, only gets supervised visits at his own expense and he is able to have a say in puberty blockers or hormone suppressants, but nothing else. Oh, and by the way, in the order, it also says that he, the mother does not have to tell the father about extracurricular activities and things of that nature. This is in Texas, you guys, Texas of all places, is a miltospineless judge, a coward that's saying, you know what, mom, you're going to get full control, you're going to full control and that is sure that that has to approve a puberty blocker, but go ahead and transition the kid and lie to his ear and indoctrinate him. You know, I call this the Barbie syndrome. American girls have been ruined by Barbie. If you really think about Barbie, kin is an ensemble. The guy has no kohunas. He's nothing. He's nothing. He's like an accessory. Hell, kin doesn't even have his own house. He's in a pink house in a pink car, right? And so all these moms want to transition their boys to play house, play doll. And I say, put your foot down if you're a father, okay, man up, take your house back, all right. If your, if your wife wants, was not a little Johnny to be Janine or whatever, okay, pull him aside, get him on a recording, let him speak for himself like the son does and go to war for the sons of this nation because this is Texas. You think, how do you think this thing plays out in Illinois? How do you think this thing plays out in AOC, you know, county? Yeah. Terrible, right? Yeah. So, okay. But historically though, as you know, dads lose in Texas. They lose everywhere, yeah. They lose. They lose in Texas when it comes to custody and yes, granted, often they should, but dads have almost no shot in Texas. Yeah, and I, by the way, this mother of this child, Sydney is apparently a doctor. I was going to say, isn't she a pediatrician? Yes, she's a pediatrician. I mean, there's like footage of this little boy saying to his dad, like, mom puts me in dresses, she paints my nails. I don't really like it. Yadda, yadda, yadda. And this stuff just really depresses me. Not as a judge looking at that. Not go, well, the child, the child doesn't want this. There's this reasonable doubt, right? No. Well, the problem is co-insure. In these cases, the problem is always like coercion, basically, like which parent is coercing the child into doing and saying particular things. There's no easy solution here because we are living in this sort of weird reality at the moment, where if your child does say, I'm not in the right body, then for some reason that supersedes the logic that they will in fact grow out of it, which we know that like, you know, somewhere in the realm of 90 plus percent of children do outgrow this, this gender dysphoria thing. I think this case is particularly sad because the little boy is a twin and the brother is not being subjected to the same treatment as James is. And what's super sad about it is that there are other cases that have happened in the past where we have actually seen how this plays out. And in those cases, the children commit suicide. Yeah. Because the child is the victim here. The only loser here, the child loses. The mother is a sociopath from what it sounds like. The mother is an insane person. 100%. And obviously, we don't know the goings on behind closed doors and what have you, but I would argue that this mom probably should not be in any capacity in charge of this child's medical system. Yes. And instead she's now in charge of, yeah, of all of that. Something would have happened in the court. Okay. Something would have happened. Someone would have done something something nefarious went on. This is not normal. Yeah, I know. I hope that they get to the bottom of it. By the way, you can go to save James on Facebook. If you are a Facebook member, you can go to the, there's a group there. There's a page that will give updates. If you want to be updated on this particular case, we got to take a break. We'll be back. Get ready. James is going to need a decade of therapy. Transgender weight lifter Laurel Hubbard. You guys may recall Laurel was going to the Olympics for New Zealand. And everyone was like, God, look at that, guys. Would you, can I just, what a, what a glowing, just the Olympics. Such femininity, just dripping from her armpits there. But apparently Hubbard was the only competitor that did not advance to the clean and jerk stage after failing to register a single lift on three attempts. So great job. We already gave you the advantage, dude. And you couldn't even cut it there. But let's listen to the female weightlifters who were asked about Laurel competing. Let's listen to their reaction watch. There was a historic night here with Laurel Hubbard competing as the first openly transgender and a, in a individual event. And I was wondering what you felt about that and what you felt that it took place in your sport. No, thank you. Come on. Yes. Yes. It's a dude. The dude couldn't left in Gold's gym and anything. He can go beat the girls were actually Olympic lifters. You know, it's just the whole thing. How insulting to ask them that. Yeah. Like that has nothing to do with that. Yeah, they're like, they got there or he got her ass kicked. She wasn't any good. And for them to, after winning, you know, to be asked that question has got to be the most insulting thing. But it goes to show why that move was even made in the first place for that. Yes, that is the same thing we did with the Michael Sam situation out in football, where it's everybody wants to make statements and then the person can't even play to the level of everybody else. But you want to center every press conference and everything else around that, having that conversation definitely the people who have worked the entire tail off to get in the position. So I mean, you can tell when I call on Kaepernick, I'm not calling Kaepernick. Yeah, it's funny because you see, you know, she drinks the water, like you know, she wanted to say something. And she is probably like, I can't, I can't do that. This is not the place for it. No, thank you. I'm good. I'm good. Y'all got it. I don't even want to say anything about it. What a corner. What a corner question to what a move right? Stealing stealing there. This is their moment. Yeah. This is Gold's server bronze legitimately. What kind of a question? It's a terrible, terrible reporter. I mean, it's a dirty move. Well, they want the hate clicks. They want them to say something and then they want to ride about it, blow it out of proportion and they want to direct or this whatever towards the issue. I mean, that's all that. Good on them for having self control and saying, what they did is I've been way more control than I went. So good. We never got nuclear. Yeah, I would have been that clickbait that you were talking about. I would have totally. Sarah Gonzales flips the table. As far as the house down. I mean, really as a woman, can you imagine like you've spent what probably is so long of your life training for all of this competing going through multiple rounds, working with these elite coaches and then you get to that point and you're successful and they want to talk about some dude who wants to compete in your sport. I'm like, that wasn't even good. That wasn't even good. Yes. So now that that dude or do that or whatever, right? Is now famous for not being able to lift. Yeah, that's awkward. Taking. Come on, man. That is really awkward. Well, at least, at least he's still pretty. We live in one giant style. That's what we're doing. Wait, wait, I'm just waiting for the aliens to come and ping us all back up. We're going to take a look at them. I'm kind of waiting for it at this point too. Yeah, let's go. We got to take a break. Can we take my feet? Well, before we go, I'm just getting a tax pocket talk right now and I love every moment of it. Murphy still has puppy breath. He does. Oh my gosh, puppy breath is disgusting and also the best thing ever. I just want to make sure all of you can find all of these lovely people on social media and elsewhere.
