    "text": " You're a man of action. You live life to the fullest. Embrace your fears and boldly charge your own path. When life knocks you down, you get back up one more time, every time. You are not easily deterred or defeated. Rugged, resilient, strong. This is your life. This is who you are. This is who you will become. At the end of the day, and after all is said and done, you can call yourself a man. Gentlemen, it's good to have you here and it's good to have you back. This is Ryan Nickler and I am the host and the founder of the Order of Man podcast. And this point, the movement. We've been going for six strong years now. And first and foremost, just want to thank you for being on this path with us. We've got a very, very important discussion with you today. Specifically, if you're going through a separation or a divorce. But even if you're not in any one of those situations, what I'm going to share with you is still going to be applicable for you. Whether you find yourself in that situation down the road or not, I hope this is not the case that you find yourself in the midst of a separation or divorce. But I think it's pretty common for men. And it's certainly something that we need to address. So guys, before I get into that, let me just tell you very, very quickly. I do appreciate all the support over the past six years now. I just ask that you continue to support what we're doing. We need this, this word to get out. The mission to reclaim and restore masculinity. It's a grassroots movement. I don't put a bunch of time and energy into advertising and promoting and things like that. Maybe I will in the future, but for right now, my emphasis is focused on the best way that I can serve you. So as I do, I'm going to need to enlist your help in sharing, send a text, take a screenshot, post it on the socials, whatever you can to promote the visibility. And of course, legal rating and review. That's a very easy way to say thank you to give back and to help boost us. Up in the charts, I was looking at it the other day. I think we're at number 35 ish or so, some right in there. We need to be number one. There's no reason we shouldn't be number one. And in order to do that, ratings and reviews count and the amount of people that see this message. So please do that. That's it. That's all I got by way of announcements. Let's talk about this. I made a post on Instagram the other day. And by the way, if you're not following me there, make sure you do at Ryan, Mclar. That's where you can take the screenshot and post it and tag me at Ryan Mclar. And I was talking about divorce and separation, some do's and do nots. And this one hits home for me. My wife and I roughly 12 years or so ago, went through our own separation. We were separated for about four months, three, four months. Obviously we've reconciled since then and we've been happily married for 17 years now. Yep. We've got four beautiful kids. We moved here to Maine several years ago to pursue this dream and this adventure and this career path. And so things are pretty good not to say that we're without our share of challenges, but things are good. But it wasn't always that way for us. There was some very dark times. We were very. I was going to say mean to each other, but that's kind of an understatement. We were conniving and we were ruthless and relentless and we attacked each other and it was bad. And so we ended up going through a separation and I've talked about it. I think a lot of the early success we've had with order of men stem from a video that I did about our separation. So, you know, I've addressed it. So I don't need to keep beating a dead horse on this, but I share this with you because I've been through what so many of you are going through right now and what you may actually go through. Sometimes down the road. So this post on social media was basically the do's and the do not's. Now it's not an exhaustive list. It doesn't include everything and you might have some additional ideas. And if you do, please share because that's what this movement is all about. It's not me talking at you. It's all of us working together, communicating so that we can come up with some solutions for our own problems in our own lives. But basically what I was saying is that if you're going to, if you're in the midst of a divorce or separation, that it's going to get better. I know it doesn't feel like that right now. I know that it might feel like you're in the, you know, the pit of hell. And that there's darkness and despair and anguish. Around you right now. I get it. I've been there. I understand it. The rest assured it will get better. There's a light at the end of the tunnel, but there's also some things that you can do right now. To make sure that you get to that light quicker. To make sure that you manage your physical, mental and emotional health. And that you ensure that during this dark and difficult time, you still come out ahead. And that's what I want for you. Regardless of where your relationship goes, because I'm not going to tell you that by following these, you know, these 10 simple steps or whatever it is. That everything's going to work out the way that you want it right now. I'm not here to tell you that you're going to reconcile the relationship with your girlfriend or your wife or your ex. I don't know. And if I told you that I'd be, I'd be bullshitting you because I don't know and you don't know and she may not know. But regardless, however this plays out over the next year or two or three or five years, if you implement what I'm going to share with you today, you will come out on top. You'll find yourself in a better position in relationship with her. Or you'll be a great catch for the next woman to come into your life. And trust me, there will be a next woman. There will be. There's going to be somebody else. And I want you to be prepared for when that day comes. So let's break this down. Again, the do's and the do not. Number one, we'll go through the do's first. Train your body. Now here's the hard part with the do's that the list of do's that I'm going to tell you to to engage in. You don't feel like it. You don't feel like getting out of bed early. You don't feel motivated or compelled or inspired to get up and go train to go to Jiu Jitsu to go lift weights to go run to do whatever it is you're going to do. You don't feel like it. But the way you feel about it isn't really a factor unless you decide for it to be. So let's get over that. You're not going to feel like doing any of this. Do it anyway. So number one, train your body every day. Get a burly if you can. Stay up late if you have to. Do it on a lunch break if you must. But train your body in one form or the other every single day. For me personally, four days of Jiu Jitsu, four to five days of strength training. That works for me outside of that and make sure I get my steps in. We walk around the field. Me and my sons and daughter have competitions and things like that that that helped me stay active and engaged but there is deliberate and intentional in time and it's at least 45 minutes to an hour every single day. Number two, learn a new skill. A lot of this might be, it might look like distraction and to a degree it is. You need to distract yourself from these negative and toxic thoughts that you might have in the midst of a separation or divorce. But regardless of whether or not it's a distraction, the things I'm going to share with you are also going to serve you. And so learning a new skill. Learning how to shoot a bow, learning how to shoot a rifle, learning how to paint, learning how to take pictures, learning how to develop a website. One thing I told my wife the other day is I want to learn how to weld something I don't know how to do I think it'd be a valuable skill, learning survival skills, learning how to build a canoe, picking up carpentry, learning how to build furniture, playing the guitar. It doesn't even matter and it doesn't have to relate to anything career related. It doesn't have to be quote unquote logical. It doesn't have to be pragmatic or practical. If it sounds interesting, just pursue it. Hey, I want to, I've always wanted to learn how to play the guitar. Or maybe even a weird example would be like, hey, I've always wanted to learn how to play the harmonica or the harp. Okay, that's enough of a reason to go do it. So buy the harmonica, get on Amazon, you get it in a couple of days and you can play the harmonica until your hearts content. And that's what you should be doing. Learn and develop a new skill. It will distract you. But also it'll feel good because you'll see yourself improving, getting better, hitting the chords, getting the right brush strokes, building the canoe, taking a bunch of lumber that you got at your local hardware store and turning it into a new bookshelf that you've always needed. It's going to feel better when you develop and learn a new skill and you work towards that mastery. Number three, excuse me, develop a new hobby. Now this is in line with developing a new skill, but maybe there's a hobby like hunting. Geocaching. Perhaps you want to learn how to work on vehicles and you want to restore old vehicles or you want to learn to race motocross or monster trucks. I don't know. I'm just picking out random things here because it doesn't matter what it is. But develop a new hobby. Find something you can pour your heart and your mind and your energy and attention and soul into so a are distracted. And be you get better. How can you not feel good about improving in your life? It's hard. You may not feel like it. You may not have the motivation, but I promise you this is going to feel better. Number four, start a side business. Now maybe one of these skills or hobbies will actually turn into a money making venture for you. And you can start a business and this feels good for men. I think specifically is that if you can take a skill or hobby or activity or interest and you can actually turn it into a money making venture, then you begin to produce more than you consume, which is something that you can't get at length for six years. It always feels good for a man to produce. And if your income grows from 50 or 100 or 200,000, whatever it is now to all of a sudden you're making an extra 500 or 1000 or $5,000 a month. That's going to feel pretty good. That's going to improve your bank account. That's going to prove your psyche and your well being. It's certainly going to improve the lives of others because you're solving a problem. Addressing a need that other people have and then you're going to feel valuable because right now you don't right you don't, you feel worthless. You feel ashamed. You don't feel valuable. I'm saying this from experience. I know what this is like, but if on the other hand, you pick up new clients, you give them a service or an offering or solution to their problems, you're going to feel valuable. And that's going to improve your life. The next one, build new male friendships. Now, if you're anything like me and most guys are in this context anyways, is that when you get married or you get into a committed or long term relationship, the first thing to go is to, well, two things. Number one, your male friendships, all your buddies go by the wayside and I get it. You want to spend time with her. She looks better. She's more attractive. She's more fun to spend time with. She smells better. Like, of course, you're going to want to spend more time with her. And so what do we do? Well, we forsake our male friendships. And then we find ourselves in the midst of a depth divorce or separation. And we realize, Oh, shit, I don't have any friends. That's what it was for me. When my wife and I went through our separation roughly 12 years ago, I realized very quickly, I hadn't done a good job managing friendships, which was on me. I let all that stuff go. And so my buddies were on to bigger and better and greater things. And I didn't, I didn't have those guys. And even for the guys I could have reached out to, I felt awkward because I hadn't talked to them for a decade. So guys, we have to, we have to continue to nurture and develop our male friendships. And also, this is what I was saying earlier, this is going to apply whether you're divorced or you're in a healthy relationship. Don't let your male friendships go. It's a trap. It's a devastating, devastating trap. It's a carve out time, weekly two nights a week, or maybe it's in the morning before anybody else and your family gets up, but dedicate time to develop and nurture your male friendships and relationships, not just because you'll need them if you go through separation, just because it's good for you. There's things that I can't necessarily talk about with my wife. Now, I don't hide things from her. That's not what I'm saying. But there's conversations that I can't really have to the degree that I need to have them with my wife because she won't understand. But I can get on the phone. I can have a fight night. I can go to jujitsu. I can go to the game with a bunch of guys. And we can talk about some real stuff that's bothering us that's getting to us. And there's going to be an added level of accountability and improvement and wanting to improve and leveling each other up. Or even just some relief from life because there's some banter and you guys are Jack and John giving up each other a hard time and joking around and making fun of each other in a meaningful way, not just to poke at each other, but to build the camaraderie that comes with that. So don't get your friends, guys. And if you have, then you've got to make some new male friendships. Go to church, go on a hike, go to meetup.com, and you can find activities and interest in pursuits, go to a business networking group and invite guys over to fight night. Invite them to go golfing. That's a really non-threatening way to do it. Maybe you and a buddy want to go golfing and you have two open spots because you want to get the force in going. And so just invite a couple of guys that maybe don't know too well. Hey guys, I've got, you know, 18 holes of golf on Thursday at 11 o'clock and we've got two of us, I figured, hey, maybe you'd be interested in coming along. And that's a very easy way to build male friendships. So don't make it harder than it needs to be. The next one, participate in a physical challenge. Now I told you to train your body and mind, but also what you should be doing is you should be pushing yourself and or working towards something. So the physical challenge might be that you want to go do a half marathon or a five K or a full marathon or an Ironman or what Spartan race, whatever. You get the point. Push yourself. Sign up for something. All right. I'm just not ready for it. I didn't say you had to be ready for it. I said that you should participate in it. So let's say there's a Spartan race in your area in the next two months. Cool. Sign up for it right now. All right, but I'm not ready. Yeah, I know. But by signing up for it, you will be ready, right? You'll, you'll start working out. You'll start training. You'll start running. You'll start getting prepared. You'll start finding other guys who are doing these things. You'll surround yourself with the right people and in two months time, you're going to be able to run three miles, five miles, 10 miles, 18 miles, 26 miles. You'll be able to do that. You can do it. If you're anything like me, I have to have these deadlines, these things that are coming up in order to continue to propel and push me forward because if I don't have something I'm working towards. It's very easy for me to sleep in, to not train, to not work out, to eat everything I can, everything in sight, and to not improve myself. So I put targets out there. And I know that in two months I got this thing going on. And five months I've got this thing going on. In November, I've got a pretty rigorous and grueling hunt. I know I'm going to need to be prepared for that. And so I work backwards into what I need to do today and I put the rock on and a backpack and I go hike and I do trails because I realize I want to be ready for that thing. So participate in a physical challenge, something that's going to push you and test you. Next, get your financial affairs in order. It just feels good to start paying off debt to make more money that goes into starting a side business to knowing where your income is coming from to know where it's going to try to save turn it into a game. Maybe you have $1,000 in your bank account, turn it into 10,000. Maybe you have $100,000 turn it into 200,000. You guys get the point. It doesn't matter where you are. You can always improve your financial situation. And by the way, improving your financial situation will help you be more sovereign. Now you have options. Now you have choices. Now you have things you can do. You can invest. You can do one of vacations. Go on trips, participate in hobbies and activities because you have your financial affairs in order. But if you don't, this is one other thing. And if you stack this on top of going through a separation or divorce, my financial fairs aren't in order. I'm at 30% body fat. I'm a lazy slob. All this stuff starts to compound. Well, start chipping away at it, guys. Okay, you're 30% body fat. Cool. Get down to 28%. You want to lose 20 pounds? Great. Lose five. Start with five. You have $10,000 worth of debt. Good. See if you can turn that into 9,000. Next month, 7,000. Next month, 5,000. Next month, 2,000. Next month, 1,000. Then the next month, it's gone. Again, productivity, you're going to feel good about advancing and moving forward and propelling in spite of your current circumstances. And then the last one, again, this isn't exhausted, but here's on the last one on the to do list. Is get involved in a charity. It's infinitely harder to feel bad for yourself and be consumed with all the crap that's going on around you. When you're involved in work that's more important than yourself. Because you're going to see that there's people who are struggling. People who are dealing with medical conditions, people who are dealing with the loss of loved ones, people who, you know, debilitating illnesses and mental issues and a rough life. And it's going to put things into perspective. Yeah, maybe you're going through a separation, but this person has terminal cancer. Or this child just lost their mom and dad. Or this individual can't make their mortgage and can't even put food on the table. Guys, like it's going to put it in perspective and you're going to feel better. You know, I know there's this big push in modern society, especially in the quote unquote self help development space about feelings are important. No, you know what? Feelings are good. Feelings are good. They're healthy. Even the so-called negative feelings. They're there for a reason. Right. If you're feeling down because you're going through a separation right now, I get it. There's nothing wrong with feeling down. Of course. And so some people will say, well, you know, just feel better. No, I'm not here to tell you that. I'm here to lie to you and, you know, rub your balls and make you feel better. Like it's okay to feel bad. So what do we do about it? Well, let's take some things into control. Right. Let's train our bodies. Let's develop a new skill. Let's learn new hobbies. Let's start a side business, build male friendships, participate in physical challenges, get our financial affairs in order, get involved in a charity. Like it's hard to look at that list and imagine that you're going to be either the same or worse by engaging in that list. Of course, you're going to be better. All right. Let's move into the do nots. So we've got the do's and the do nots. If you're going through a separation and or divorce, do not. Number one, drink your sorrows away. You're going to feel better. You really are. I mean, if you if you decide to drink and when I say drink, I'm talking about drugs and sedation, right? You're going to sedate yourself. Guys, they're kind of feel better. Of course. Because you can turn off some of that stuff that's going on right now. So I'm not going to lie to you. You're going to feel better for an hour. Or three hours. And then you're going to wake up from your drink or drug induced coma. And you're going to feel shittier. You're not going to feel bad like you did before. You're actually going to feel worse because you're going to have that problem that's that's reoccurring. And also now you're going to feel guilty because you took an easy path out. So don't drink it away. Don't sedate it. Feel it. Embrace it. Yeah, I feel horrible. So what am I going to do about it? And this is the problem, I think, with the self development space where they say, don't feel your emotions. How would how would anybody do that? Just subdue them. No. Experience them. Feel them. Learn from that. Analyze them. And then make good choices. But don't sedate yourself. Number two, get lost in pornography. Look, we're men, right? We have sexual desires. We have physical needs that need to be met. So you might be tempted because you don't have your woman with you to get lost in pornography because you think that's the most significant thing. And again, it's going to feel good. Right. Look, I don't need to get crude with you guys, you know, because all of us have probably looked at pornography, you know, you know how you feel, you know, it makes you feel good for the next few minutes. It's not lasting. It's fleeting. It's fake. Don't get lost in that stuff. Be vigilant against some of these things I'm telling you because it's going to be very, very easy to get consumed in these things. No more accountability. She's not around. She's not looking at the computer. She's not looking at your phone. Nobody's here. You're bored. Right. There's a lot of things you can do. We've all heard idle hands or the devil's workshop. Well, so how do you get over it? Well, you do the things I told you you should be doing on the to do list. Number three, do not stock your wife or your girlfriend or your ex. Don't drive by your house or wherever she's staying. Don't try to log into her emails. I have one person I knew or no. Years and years ago, knew that his wife was cheating on. He had a friend install some sort of tracking program on their family computer. Then he would get a report or a readout every single morning, like a morning briefing and he would pull it up and he would look at the emails and whatever that app did it recorded, whatever she typed email she sent all that kind of stuff. And then he would read it and he would see the conversations that his wife was having with this other man. I mean, I know why you'd be tempted to do that. But if you already know what's going on and what's happening, why are you going to subject yourself to that? You already know what's happening. Don't be stalking her. Don't be trying to track her down. Don't try to find out. Don't show up at her office. Don't do that stuff. Because not only is it weird and comes across as a creep creepy type thing. Now you're chasing her. And what do people do or even animals do when you chase them? They run. You want your wife back. You want your girlfriend back. Stop chasing her. She'll stop. But the more you chase her around and you act like this, the less appealing because you're going to come across as desperate. I've done I'm not going to lie like I've driven by an ex girlfriend's house. I'm trying to find out what my wife during our separation with my wife is doing at any given time. I'm trying to be real truthful with you here. It's like it's not something I enjoy talking about. Like, I don't want to talk about that in the context of like when I was in my lowest and darkest point of my life. Here's what I did to try to track down my wife. No, I don't. But I'm just telling you, I know from experience, just resist distract yourself, get involved in the dues when you're tempted to drive by or tempted to call or attempted to track her down or tempted to show up at her work. You're at a party or whatever. Like, just don't. Ryan, what if she, what if she leave? Like, look, chasing her around. Is it going to make her stay? And I'm not saying you shouldn't be engaged. Of course, when my wife and I were through our separation that we had a one year old son, I stayed engaged with her to the best of my ability. But I did try to as difficult as it was, try to disengage so that we could both have the space we needed to figure things out. So don't be, don't be stalking her. It's not, it's not a good, it's not a good look. It's not going to help your cause either. Next, this is number four. Do not sleep with a bunch of women. You're not going to feel better. Because you're going to find loose women, low value women. You're going to consider yourself a low value man. You're going to make mistakes. Maybe you have unwanted pregnancies, STDs, emotional attachment, drama, baggage, the guilt that comes with knowing that you're maybe married and yet you're sleeping with somebody else. There's so much drama, BS and baggage that goes along with this. I'm not saying don't ever, in the history of your life, ever sleep with another woman again. I'm saying that if you're going through a separation currently, you're in the midst of a divorce, you're early into a divorce right now. You don't need to be looking for the rebound. You don't need to be having other women spread their legs. You don't need that stuff. You don't. Just chill. All right? Just don't. There's too much that goes. You are not in the mental and emotional and spiritual place right now to be engaging in sex with another woman right now. You're just not in that. You're not in the right mindset. So yeah, you're horny. And yeah, you think it's going to feel good and you're going to feel wanted and valuable for the 10 minutes or whatever it is. That's it guys. That's it. Because you're mental and emotional well-being worth 15, 20, 30 minutes and feeling good. I hope the answer is no. You're not going to get what you want by doing that. And what you want is to feel valuable to feel needed to feel important to feel significant. That's what you want, right? That's what I would want. That's what I want now. I want that. And sleeping with loose women is not going to provide that for you. Not to mention all the other baggage that comes along with it. The next, do not seek vengeance. And I'm not saying go to the ultimate measure, like, you know, take her life. I'm not suggesting that. Of course, don't do that. All right. I shouldn't have to throw that disclaimer out there. But yes, don't do that. But don't be. Don't try to get her. Don't try to get her fired. Don't try to make her life miserable. Don't don't don't talk with you. Just if you have kids don't don't try to throw her under the bus. Don't just don't do that. And you're going to be very tempted to do that, especially if there's a lot of contention and bitterness and animosity. Just don't do it. Guys, don't seek vengeance. Don't get her back. Don't try to get her fired. Don't try to undermine the relationship she has with her. Look, even with kids, this is a long term relationship. You may not be intimate or anymore, but this is a long term relationship. So don't. Don't focus on what I told you to focus on. So you don't focus. You're going to be mad. There might even be hate and hostility and anger and aggression. I get it. I, I understand it. In a lot of cases, it might actually be warranted, but the way you act, there's a difference between the way you think and act. And if you're acting those things out, you're not serving her, of course, but you're not even serving yourself. And that's what's important. You're not going to feel better by being a dick. Don't do it. And the last one here, guys, so this is point number six on the do not list. Don't end your life. Don't end your life. I know it's dark. I know you're depressed. I know you're sad. I know you think that your life is over, that it won't get better. You're alone at times. You might feel miserable. That's a permanent fix to a temporary problem. If you're in that position and you're feeling like maybe you should end your life. Connect with somebody. Shoot me a message. There's suicide hotlines. You hopefully you have friends that you can call. You have people you can be around. Go somewhere. Go to a concert. Go to a restaurant. Go to the movie. Like just go around other people. Guys, don't end your life. It's going to get better. It will. I promise you it will. You're going to be a great catch for the next woman to come in your life. You know, if I'm 40 years old, if my wife and I separated right now, I would be miserable. I'm going to be a great catch for the next woman to come in your life. You know, if I'm 40 years old, if my wife and I separated right now, I would be miserable. It would be a dark. Horrible time in my life. It really would. But I know that it would get better. Because it has before and I've gone through this. And there's millions of other men who have gone through what you're going. It's not meant to discount what you're going through right now, but it's meant to say that those guys can get through it. So can you. So be strong. Engage in these things in absence of the strength that you feel like you may be lacking right now. It's going to get better. Let me recap. Here's the. Let me, let me go through the do not list and then I'll go through the do list. Do not drink your sorrow away. Don't sedate yourself. A drug drug call. Do not get lost in pornography. Do not stock your wife or girlfriend or your ex. Don't sleep. With a bunch of women. Do not seek vengeance and ultimately do not end your life. Here's what you should do instead. Number one, train your body. These are daily, by the way. These things should be done daily. Number two, learn a new skill. Number three, develop a new hobby. Number four, start a side business. Five, build new male friendships and also solidify. Existing friendships that you have. Number six, participate in a physical challenge that's going to push you. Number seven, get your financial affairs in order. And number eight, get involved in a charity. You can do it guys. I have faith in you. Again, I know it's hard. I know it's dark. I know you're desperate. That's not an indictment upon you or your weakness or your strength or whatever. It's just it is what it is. And I've been there, but you're going to get through it. Reach out to me. Reach out to a hotline, connect with other men, join our Facebook groups, join the Iron Council. By the way, the Iron Council is a great place. We have a lot of men in there who have gone through divorces, who have gone through separations, who are in the midst of it right now. And if you don't have people around you, you can immediately tap into it. You're going to do two things when you join the Iron Council. You're not going to come in there and just complain to everybody about how horrible your life is. That's not what the Iron Council is about. So a bunch of guys who will say, right in this horrible spot, should I join the Iron Council? I don't know. What are you willing to give? Well, I don't know. I'm just in this horrible spot. Look, I get it. And so you can certainly extract value from me. I don't know. I don't know. I'm just in this horrible spot. I'm just in this horrible spot. Look, I get it. And so you can certainly extract value from me. I don't know. I'm just in this horrible spot. Look, I get it. And so you can certainly extract value from the Iron Council. But those who come in with the attitude of giving and adding value are served infinitely better than those who just want to extract. So if you decide you want to join and band with us, you're going to be expected to contribute, even though you might be in a dark and desperate time. So that's another option for you. Orderman.com slash Iron Council. But guys, there's a lot of things you can do. I think I laid it out pretty good for you here. Do it. And reach out to people if you need help. Okay? All right, guys. That's all I got for today. We'll be back next week. Until then, go out there. Take action. Become the man you are meant to be. Thank you for listening to the Order of Man podcast.
