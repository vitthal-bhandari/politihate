    "text": " I'm Mo Raka and I'm excited to announce season 4 of my podcast, Mobituaries. I've got a whole new bunch of stories to share with you about the most fascinating people and things who are no longer with us, from famous figures who died on the very same day. To the things I wish would die, like buffets. People actually take little tastes along the way with their fingers. Oh, they do. Oh, Mo, I'm so sorry. Do you need a minute? This is the only interview where I've needed a spit bucket. I'm so sorry. We'll tell you about the singer who helped define cool and the sports world's very first superstar. To call Jim Thorpe the greatest athlete in American history is not a stretch because no athlete before his sense has done what he did. Listen to Mobituaries with Mo Raka on the iHeartRadio app, Apple Podcasts, or wherever you get your podcasts. You're listening to Comedy Central. Please welcome Anthony Paravsky. Hi. Welcome, my friend. Thank you for having me. So good to finally have you on the show as a fan of what you do on Queer Eye as a fan of your cooking. I've been lucky enough to taste your cooking. And then when I heard you were coming out with a cookbook, I was like, this is, it's a match made in heaven. It's kids' music. Are you ready to give away your secrets, though? I am. It was a long time coming. It's still just seeing my face on a book and thinking how much time went into it and just knowing that it's there is like, you know what? Everything is surreal right now. Sitting here with you, looking at the book. Just life has been surreal for the past year and a half. I feel like you're in the business of making people's lives surreal, though. That's what you do on Queer. That's what makes it such a fun show. You go around America, you just like get in people's lives. One thing I enjoyed about what you do specifically on the show is you connect people with their food. Something that has, I feel like, has been a disconnect in America, especially for a long time where people just go like, oh, it's just food. And you go like, no, food is more special than we think it is. Why? I think it's so much more than that. I mean, it's how you say, I love you. It's how you say, I'm sorry to someone. It connects you to your roots, where you came from. It's how you meet new friends. When you came over, it's the medium for me for everything. It's my love language. And I think especially in like, it's a messed up world. Like it's really a messed up world. I think that it's an incredible opportunity to just connect with other people and break bread and have conversations. Yeah, quite literally breaking bread. I mean, that's what makes it so. There's no bread recipe in the book, but you know. That's for the next one. Yeah, but it really is like a, you know, it's a social experience. Absolutely. It's a beautiful vibe that you have with food. You have a connection with it though, where it really does feel like a love language. You know, what I've read a lot of cookbooks and normally it's just, I read it for the pictures. I'm not actually going to do anything. I do. I just like pictures of great food. And then I eat my food and I'm like, mmm. But like, this book is very personal because like, you tell stories of like, what it was like for you to come out as gay. You talk about like how your, you know, your culture affects your food and who you are as a person. Why did you infuse so much of your story into the cooking? I mean, I think, look, Queer Eye is a service job, right? We show up for perfect strangers and we try to figure out how we can be of service in such a short amount of time. This was an opportunity to tell my story and we're trying to figure out, we spent a lot of time trying to figure out like, what kind of book we wanted to do. Is this going to be technical? Is it going to be my Polish heritage? And I realize that it doesn't have to be one thing or the other. It's an autobiography. It travels from like food that I, when I was a little kid. Yes. So like stuff I ate when I was a broke ass student to dishes that I prepare now. And like my Polish heritage, like I was ashamed to be Polish for a pretty big portion of my life. And I fell back in love with it. And I think that it's incredibly important. And I just wanted to like every single recipe in that book has a story behind it. Right. If someone reads this though and they go, Anthony, look, I love your cooking, right? But I am a horrible, horrible cook. Like not me, just another person. Someone else. Someone else is saying this right now. They're like, Anthony, I don't know how to cook. And this looks amazing. Like how easy is it to get this done? Because like cookbooks always, it always seems easy, but it's like, like the pictures are amazing. I mean, like if you see some of the things that are being prepared here, I mean, look at this. Like look at, yeah, look at that. That's like literally five ingredients. There's no excuse for that. Yeah, I've never seen this looks like nothing I've ever made ever. Like this is... It's fennel and citrus. They go all together. This is like just an egg. Everyone should love veggie might have a crispy egg. Look at that. I've never ever ever made an egg that looks like this. But you know what? It takes practice. Like I've ruined about 50 chickens, trying to figure out how to roast them perfectly until I finally got it right. I've been making risotto for years and then finally learned that you're not supposed to like mix it vigorously, but it's like gently folding it in so that you don't break down the arborio rice. Wow. It's like it's something that you learn and you nurture it and you, you know. Wow. Did I just teach you something? Yeah, no. That's dope. I was gonna... I taught you about like the emulsification powers of pasta water with the spaghetti lemo. Just everything. Yeah. That's what this book is. Just like giving people an opportunity to begin the process of learning how to express themselves through food. Yeah. And just like on Queer Eye, for some people they have a bit of a background and you want to teach them technical things for other people. The ones who really interest me are the ones who supposedly don't care and just eat granola bars every day and I try to find an emotional connection. I love it. You know what? I'm gonna take it. I'm gonna try and cook something from the book and then I'm going to send you a picture on Instagram. Please. And it'll look nothing like you. I'm excited. It'll look nothing like the book. We don't know that. We don't know that. We don't know that. I'll keep on trying. Thank you so much for coming to the show. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm watching my own kitchen. It's a beautiful book that's available now. I'm actually for us, Peter. And videos at TheDailyShow.com. Follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
