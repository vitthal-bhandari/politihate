    "text": " Welcome in final hour of the week. 14 hours up. One hour to go. Buck is soon to be on route to Scotland with his lovely wife, Kerry. We'll be breaking down everything for you next week. And then Buck will be back the week after. Appreciate all of you hanging out with us. News that is out there. According to the New York Times, Donald Trump has chosen not to engage in the debate on Wednesday in Milwaukee that will be airing on Fox News. Instead, again, this is according to the Times, Trump will do a live interview, which I presume would air on Twitter and probably other places as well with Tucker Carlson. We bring in now my friend Sage Steele, who has recently left ESPN. We got a bunch to dive into with her. But Sage, let's start there with the with the idea that Trump, I'm sure you've probably seen that news that Trump might skip the debate and instead do an interview with Tucker Carlson at the same time. How does that strike you? What do you think of that? I mean, it's just exactly what we should have expected the whole time, right? Especially for it to air at the exact same time. I mean, listen, I think for those about to follow politics that would have been fascinating, would have been great TV for him to join. But I mean, strategically, it's probably really smart. And oh, by the way, it's August of 23. You've got time for that. I just made me smile when I heard you sharing the news just there because it's exactly what we should have expected. All right. Let's I bet a lot of our audience will know who you are. Certainly we've been friends for a long time. But I want for people because this is obviously a different audience than just a traditional sports audience. Yeah. You have been with ESPN for how long? What is your background? How would you describe yourself to? Let's be a little bit, a little bit braggadocious here, the biggest audience in all of radio that might not all know you already Sage. Who are you and and what's your background? My favorite thing about you is your your humility. Yes. Yes. I started at ESPN in February of 2007. My kids were 11 months old at the time, 11 months to and four. And now they're 17, 19 and 21 and the older two just got back to college at High Point University in North Carolina for their sophomore and junior years and my youngest is about to be a senior in high school and she's celebrating because she got the house to herself. No arguments about the car with her siblings. And you know what? My kids, my parents, my family, that's what I'm all about. That is what has always driven me, especially over the last couple of years when things have kind of gone in directions I never could have dreamt of. But I mean the background background and I'll just be quick is yeah, I'm a proud army brat. My dad is a retired army colonel. He just turned 77 years old. And the reason I love sports and had this crazy dream of being a sportcaster back in the 80s. I mean, I'm 50. So back in the 80s when women weren't doing this, it's because my dad and his athleticism and his history, that's what drove me out of the daddy's girl still in. And he I brag about my dad because he won't. But he broke the color barrier at West Point. The first black man to ever play varsity football there. And he was an all-American tight end way back then at six, six and a half in the 60s. He was massive. And he was principled. And he was an incredible man and my hero. And he and the principals that he instilled in me and my brothers, that's what drives me. And that's what really keeps me strong even with things that I never thought I'd ever be talking about or doing. That is a fantastic story about your dad. I know we have a lot of West Point grads and also people who are certainly in the armed forces today. That are listening to us. And that is a fabulous story. Okay. So you started at ESPN in February of 2007. It doesn't feel like that long ago. But I'm curious what you saw in terms of the trajectory of ESPN, which I think it's fair to say back in February of 2007, I'll be honest. I mean, I would have said, Hey, that's just a sports network. You go there to find out who won a game. You go there to find out who got traded, who's signing as a free agent. You put on Sports Center, you kick back and you have a beer and you enjoy whatever the nightly news was associated with sports. I bet that's probably what you found it to be like in February of 2007. You just left ESPN and announced you were leaving this week. How did things change from February of 2007 to you deciding that you wanted to leave? And what you said was a dream job that you had at ESPN. Yeah. I mean, I play everyone who knows me knows that this absolutely was my dream. And since I was 11 years old and announced I wanted to be a sport tester to the shock of my parents, because I was like this super shy, quiet little girl. And they're like, really? I'm going to do this. And you might have to talk every once in a while and not hide between our legs. So they listen, they watched me every single day that they could over the last 16 and a half years at ESPN and kind of just in awe because of how I really had to transform as a person to live out this dream and get over that shyness. And I still have it sometimes. I just know how to flip that switch pretty well. Back then in 2007, it was just a different world. Social media wasn't a thing. We were strongly encouraged at ESPN to get onto Twitter. I think I thought the other day when I was changing my bio at the top of my Twitter page that April 09, I think is when I joined. And there wasn't a thing called Twitter and social media. I mean, I wasn't part of my space or any of that crap because I was told that at the time, I think, I don't know, I was old and married and busy. Social media has changed everything because I think back then it really was my CTV. People really did need to come to us for the news, breaking news. We would promote it on the radio during the sports and our updates during whatever radio show that was probably Colin Coward's show and watch sports in our 6am or whatever it was. So times have just changed. The talent group has changed. Stuart Scott, my late, great dear friend, you know, he was Stuart, then, man. We had Kenny May. We had all of the great Dan Patrick was leaving, I think, right as I was arriving. I remember seeing him in the stairway once and like hyperventilating. It's like that's Dan Patrick. It was a different time. It was a beautiful time there. And I remember being scared to death to walk in there. And it really is an incredible place with a campus that truly is like a college campus with some awesome people that I mean it when I say this. I'm sad because of so many great, great people and great experiences that I had. And I have zero regrets. But it certainly has changed as I think every network has changed since 2007. Okay. So do you remember and for people who don't know, you got suspended because you went on Jay Cutler's podcast, Jay Cutler's a friend of mine. He lives here in Nashville, former NFL quarterback. And basically you said, Hey, I don't think they should have mandated the COVID shot. You had some other things to say. But I want to start before we get to that. Do you remember a moment in time where you thought, Hey, this doesn't just feel like a sports network anymore. It feels very political to do you remember a moment in time or an event that occurred where you sort of thought, Hey, looking back, this is the line of demarcation. This is when things changed. I do think it was kind of a gradual process. I do. I think it kind of feels like it's not up on us. But listen, through the years, we always remember Andy Katz, who is so great, one of our layoffs that really heard us back. I think he was a part of the 2017 layout that called basketball reporter and insider. He's an awesome human and really damn good at his job. And every single year he came up with the idea to go to the White House and have Barack Obama do the bracketology and build the bracket because Obama was such a basketball fan. And it felt okay done. I remember saying, Wait a minute, Trump likes sports too. Why aren't we going to the White House? You know, with college football stuff, I don't know. He used to own a football team, right? Or the XFL? Like, I use the FL. I really thought, Well, why aren't we doing it now? And I remember asking that question and, you know, I didn't really get answers. So to me, it felt gradual. I think during the Trump term things really changed. And again, I know that we aren't the only place. It changed everywhere. But it seemed like that's when it became okay in our country to just outwardly bash the administration. And I get it. And that's what people's rights are. And that's something I will always stand up for. It's just if you did bash or say something critical during Obama administration, it was completely unacceptable. Yeah. And it's interesting because, and I want to go to the COVID shot in particular, and I bet you would agree. If someone had come out and said, Oh, 100%, Disney should mandate the COVID shot, they would have not gotten criticized at all. Probably would have gotten praised. You said the opposite. And what was the reaction when you went on that podcast? And then you also said your, as you mentioned, your dad was, I think the first black football player at West Point, your mom is white, your mixed race, like Barack Obama, you also talked about that. Your experience is just as valid as his experience. And ESPN just basically said, Oh, Sage, steal. You can't have the opinions that you shared, even though you shared them out of work. I think it's such a fascinating dynamic of what happened to you. It's fascinating. That's a word to use for sure. That's one that I've used others, but that one worked. I, you're right. And that's what I said a million times that if I had said shame on all these anti-vaxxers, you apparently don't care about your neighbors and your coworkers and you're going to harm others and kill others and how selfish you are, because that's what was being told to people like me, who just questioned it. I was never against the vaccine. I was against the mandate or being forced to take it or anything. I mean, it's kind of consistent. I hadn't given my kids a flu shot in probably a decade, not because I had really researched flu shots, frankly, more because I forgot. I mean, I'm an imperfect mother in more ways than one. They'll tell you that. I forgot. And then I was like, wow, they've gone for several years now and haven't ever gotten sick. So just keep it going. If I don't have to put more shots in them. So it really came organically. But to me, I was very apprehensive, just from the basic research that I did, because I didn't go too deep on it. You didn't have to, but to see how quickly it was being forced, the vaccine, and it became political. That's when I was like, wait a minute. This makes me uncomfortable. And I just want to wait. Can I just wait a little bit longer? Give me six months to make sure that we totally know the effect of this vaccine. Knowing that the FDA usually takes about six to nine years on average to approve vaccines. And this is six months. So I had a problem with it. And especially with my kids who, you know, the goalposts kept moving with it, right? First it was kids under 20. You know, don't worry about it. You're fine. You're healthy. You don't have to worry about it. And then the age kept lowering. And I just, the inconsistencies made me question it. And so I, listen, I waited until that day. The very last day I could have gotten shot in order to have followed the rules and to be fully vexed by the, I think it was the September 30th deadline. And I waited until the last second because it's quiet. I didn't want to do it and I wasn't going to do it. I was going to take a chance and I guess maybe get fired. I didn't know. But at the end of the day, I have three kids at the time, one was in college. And, you know, financially I'm divorced. And financially it's all on me 100%. So I couldn't. And I did what I had to do despite being disgusted with myself or caving is the way I viewed myself at that point and giving into what I believe, especially being forced to do something to my body. So I did what I had to do at that time. And I just prayed that if something came as a vaccine, you know, fine, let it be me. Just don't let it be my kids, which they're not vaccinated. But trust me when I say I didn't take it lightly. And I ran literally from getting the damn shot, ran home to do the podcast with Jay that I almost missed because I was struggling so much with taking the shot itself. And I came on and I had to band it on my shoulder and I wasn't thinking about it. And just we started talking and he asked and I wanted to pretty to answer the question. I complied. I did what I needed to do. And that was the other thing. It's like, we I I complied along the rules and I can have an opinion. Because like you said, if I'd had the other opinion, I probably wouldn't have heard from anybody. Would you have ever believed when you started at ESPN back in February of 2007, that saying men who identify as women shouldn't be champions would be considered a controversial app controversial opinion to have anywhere but much less at a sports network. And for you and Sam Ponder in particular to be called bigots by other women who work at ESPN for having that opinion. What does that say about the perspective of ESPN when you get suspended for questioning the COVID shot and other coworkers can call you a bigot for not believing that men who pretend to be women should be women's champions and nothing at all happens to them. Well, there's a couple of different topics there with the transgender. I wouldn't believe it two years ago much less in 2007. I still can't believe it. And that's why I really won't even bother. I'm happy to have discussions and conversations. That actually that to me is what is missing in this country right now is people are either afraid or unwilling to have conversations about important topics. But this to me is useless because it's ridiculous. And for all those people who preach science, especially over the last couple of years, they're conveniently ignoring science right now. So this is just a ridiculous topic to me. And I knew that when I tweeted about it that it would not be appreciated by some, but you get to the point where you cannot stay for me. I couldn't stay silent anymore, especially about something that is so important. I have been on record for years, not obviously just as a woman in a man's world, but as a woman fighting for other women and young women, especially mother with two daughters and a son who I want to really raise as a man and to respect women and women are equal and we can do the same things you can as far as what we are worse, what we can do professionally, so many things. And so to have this as a thing, again, I used to host the ESPNW Summit, which I was so proud of for the first 10 years, 11 years of its existence. And on that stage, all I would do was help uplift women and let's have these conversations and why are we making less here or there? Why are we doing fewer women's highlights and certain parts of our network? Let's be equal. And so for all of those women to be silent right now, I'm like, where are you? Where are you ladies? Which one is it? You do get to support women as a whole or you don't and you can't pick or choose. I think the funniest part to me, and it really made me laugh is when Megan Rapinoe called me out as well as Martina Navertalova and Dave Chappelle. And I was like, that's awesome company. I love Chappelle. As far as our opinions on biological men, forget biological men playing women's sports and that by standing up for women that I'm promoting violence against the transgender community, I just can't. That's why I don't even bother responding to some of that because it's not worth it. So I'm sad where we are. I'm grateful that my girls are no longer really playing competitive sports because I would be I would be a nuisance to these people. Can you stick with us a little bit of time? I don't know what you've got, but I got a couple more questions for you. Clay, you know what I'm doing?

On the front lines of truth. Appreciate Sage Steel hanging with us. And I wanted to hit this because I know you told Meghan Kelly this, but I just saw you share it. And I do think it's an important message for a lot of people out there. You, as you talked about it with us earlier, your dad is black. He was one of the first, if not the first football player at West Point for Army. You tweeted this for years, I've been called to sell out because I identify as biracial or that I'm quote, not black enough for all those biracial kids out there. I pray you don't wait as long as I did to realize that you don't have to accept that hypocritical BS. You are perfect to the way you are. And please don't let anyone tell you otherwise. There are a lot of kids out there of all different backgrounds. I just want to give you an opportunity that's incredibly well said. But it feels like and you can tell me if I'm wrong or not that inside of ESPN, and I think this is happening all over the country and many different organizations that identity politics requires people to say, Oh, I'm on this team. Oh, I'm on that team. Did you feel like you were being judged for not being quote black enough by some employees who were black at ESPN? I have felt that way for years, regardless of where I've been or where I've worked. But it's pretty well documented that I was treated differently because I'm literally quote, not black enough. There's a history about it. I know you all have written about it at Outkick in the past. I will say one thing about that tweet. I should have changed it. I should have been more aware of my wording because someone on Twitter pointed out to me that I shouldn't use the word I identify as biracial because I am biracial. Period. That's who I am. My mother's half-white as you can excuse me, my mother's half-irous half-Italian, white, fiery, like the most beautiful woman you'll ever meet. Get out of her way too. She will take you out. And my dad is black and I am biracial. So I've been an identity, right? With all the identity stuff we've been talking about in this country lately, so I need to be more aware and more specific. I could not be more proud of who I am. I mean, it goes back to when I was a little girl. The difference is I told Megan is that in the military, it truly is the most diverse, beautiful upbringing, I think, for a kid. And granted, I lived in all over the world. By the time I was 11, I lived in four countries. I didn't really have a home. I still don't know where home is. It's certainly not going to be. It's not a kid forever. But when I had an incredible family unit, no matter where we were in the world, that said, you are beautiful the way you are and we are steals and we are good and we are together. It also is very sheltered, though, because the military is so diverse. So I didn't experience this negativity and this hatred until I left that. And late high school, early college is when I really started to feel it and really felt like I was different. So I was really sheltered, I guess, and maybe I'm late to the party, but I'm grateful for that upbringing that was awesome as well as just 11-hour country, especially while living in other countries. Did I feel it amongst my peers at ESPN a thousand percent? I think that's what really breaks my heart because it comes from the same people who preach about diversity and tolerance and acceptance and inclusion. But what they're doing to their own, quite often not all, just a very loud vocal minority, is exactly what they're preaching against. And that is why I had to say a couple of years ago, like enough is enough. You can't preach one thing and practice another. The problem is, is everybody's been allowed to because if you call someone on it, then you are racist. And including if that's me, and I've been told that I'm a racist, and the names on Twitter I told Megan yesterday, I mean, it's amazing the hatred that has come and people threatening my life, my kids' lives. You know, one time, Clay, my mother after one of the, you know, instances was on my Instagram and she called me and she's crying. And she's a hard-ass husband. My mom doesn't cry, but she was crying and she's like, they please go through, please go through and delete all those, I mean, there were thousands of hateful comments wishing me harm amongst other things. She just just delete them. And in that moment, I was going to go do it because I don't want my mom to hurt. As a mother, I can't imagine what that would feel like. She was a mama bear just like I am. I would take people out and she tried. And I said, mom, I can't delete those comments as much as I would like to because everyone hits me hard. If I delete those, it would be like it isn't happening. And this is real. This is the reality for me and millions of other people who are just trying to be proud of their heritage, no matter what it is. Mine happens to be as a biracial woman. And so I chose at that moment, it was in 2017 actually, I'm like, I will not delete any of this ever because it's real. And it helps remind me of how far we have to go and that if I continued to live in fear of talking about it, then I would actually be part of the problem. So there's a real beauty and no longer caring what other people think. And that's taken me, okay, I'm 50, I'll be 51 in November, taken me about 47 years. And so I think I'm most proud of myself for, which I don't usually talk about why I'm proud of myself. But because I dropped that feeling of needing to be liked by everybody, it was devastating. Especially people that you think are your friends or people that you think support you at work, within the organization, the bosses, etc. But once I let go of that and realize that being silent is being part of the problem, it was really freeing. It's something I have to work on every day. And I think that that's what I'm most proud of because I know now that by speaking out, I'm making a little bit of a difference here or there. And I feel like now, if I've ever questioned why I chose this profession or why I'm still standing after so many things that are held a lot more important than what's happened with my career, like with my family and with my father's cancers, I know that this is the reason why, because I'm no longer afraid. And it's time that people start to stand up because if you don't, you can't complain about the issues, in my opinion. We're talking to Sage Steele formerly of ESPN. Is it true that you weren't allowed to be involved in a George Floyd special on ESPN because other ESPN employees said you weren't black enough? Yeah, I mean, it's that was a painful thing. And you know, I would say that if you look at the statement that those people involved in that made after the news broke, then I think that that does it all. There was certainly not a denial and it went in a complete opposite direction, the statement. So you know what? I'm glad it happened. It woke me up. It woke me up. And I thought, oh my gosh, even when you try to do things the right way and I am imperfect. Ask my three kids, ask my parents, ask my best friends, you know, ask my dog for God's sake. Like I have a long way to go in every aspect of my life. But I know that I have always led with kindness and tried to treat people as I want to be treated. That is part of how I was raised and part of what I think God wants us to do. So it was a great lesson. Like, wow, even when you're true to yourself, which is what everybody preaches, I learned that it doesn't necessarily matter if you don't go along with a certain narrative. And that was painful, but I wouldn't, I swear to you, I wouldn't change it because it opened my eyes. And it kind of brought up a little bit of a rage in me. Like something I didn't know that I had, then like this is inherently wrong. And like I said, hypocritical, if you're preaching one thing, you've got to practice it. And that in itself is racist. What does it mean to not be black enough? What the hell does that mean? I don't know too many other cultures that do that to each other within their own community. I've been traded. And according to Twitter, I've been treated so many times back to the white camp from the black camp. They let go of me a long time ago. I've been told. So I hope they, I hope they got a team of ransom in that trade. But I don't know. But isn't the goal, Sage, that every single individual white, black, Asian, Hispanic, or mixed race backgrounds of that group, isn't the goal that everybody should be able to stand on their own individual belief? Shouldn't that be what we aspire to? Isn't that what you want for your kids? It's certainly what I want for my kids. That's all I want. And to me, that's actually what, what this is about for me, what standing up was all about. Diversity, I remember speaking about this when I went back to my alma mater to speak probably in like 2010. I went to Indiana. I'm a proud Hoosier alum. And I remember something had happened. And I remember thinking, Oh my gosh, diversity, but it doesn't, if it doesn't begin with diversity of thought, then this other diversity, DEI stuff doesn't even matter. DEI wasn't even a thing back then. That wasn't an acronym for anything. You know, now it certainly is. I think they keep adding letters and plus and minus signs to it. I don't know. But like, it begins and ends with diversity of thought. And if we can't accept others for their opinions, then why is anything else going to matter? It's funny because we really do choose to focus on DEI throughout corporate America and everywhere. And that global corporate decisions are made based on that. How about the diversity of thought was, okay, well, hey, they want to identify as a woman today or a man today versus yesterday or versus certainly how they were born. We're okay with that, but not with that diversity of thought of how I want to celebrate what I am, which is a biracial woman who had the best upbringing, the two most loving parents in October. They're married 52 years when nobody gave them a shot, including their families. My mom's parents disowned her because she was married a black man. So that's why I have perspective play. Like my step has certainly accepted me and, you know, okay, made some headlines for a minute. It is nothing compared to what my parents went through. And by the way, they chose that in 1970 coming off the civil rights era when there were a lot more serious issues. I mean, you think about what was going on with the law right there, with Vietnam, and my parents are so courageous. So I sometimes, I just just laugh because I'm like, I have, I'm nothing. That's why I'm not afraid anymore, because I know that there's bigger things and people in my family have endured so much more makes it easier now to stand up. It just took me a long time and it better late than never, I guess. Last question for you. And I would encourage you guys if you've enjoyed this, reach out to Sage. You can find her on Twitter at Sage deal. You're now free. You can say exactly what you want. You don't have to worry about somebody looking over your shoulder at ESPN. You don't have to worry about co-workers saying you're not black enough or you're not this or you're not that. Okay, I'll try it. They're just no longer my co-workers. That's a good point. That's a very good point. So what now? What you want to make an impact, it sounds like based on the stories that you're telling us here. What's next? I don't know. And that is kind of scary because I've always had a plan, right? Here's the thing, my plan has been foiled a million times. When it happened to me, when my plan for foiled in college, which I need to write a book at some point and that all of this will be explained further and they are excited. I feel like sometimes I talk too much, but my mom's during a devastating time in college when I thought my entire dream of being a forecaster was blown up. They lived in Portland, North Kansas. My dad was still in the military at that time and I was in Bloomington, Indiana at school. My mom sent me a framed little thing and a little poster in a frame and it said, if you want to give God a good laugh, tell him your plans. And so I've never forgotten that. I still have that beat up old frame from 30 plus years ago in my office right now. As far as what I would like to do, I want to be able to continue learning what it's like to speak freely. I haven't done that. I mean, I graduated from IU in 1995 from the five-year plan, best five years of my life, 95. It's 2023 and I've always been part of the media and I've loved every second, even the crap clay. I've loved every second, but I've always been super respectful of my job as a journalist. Time's gotten funky the last couple of years, right? We don't know the lines. The lines have been blurred thanks to lack of clear rules and holding people accountable at work and now it's all over the place. Some are allowed to speak, others are not. I just want to be able to have conversations about this kind of stuff because every time I do, I've realized that the more vulnerable I am in sharing things that are very personal and scary and make me emotional like I was on making yesterday, every time I do it, I realize it does help somebody who doesn't have a platform but maybe hasn't heard anybody speak openly about being told that they're not black enough. And so if I can continue to talk about it, then for those other biracial kids who are being told to change, maybe I can help them and maybe I can help them not take as long to have the courage to stand up. Even when you know you're going to get crushed and your friendships are going to end and I have to use friendship and air quotes now because true friends support you. You know how many friends I have that think look similarly to me as far as the more politics or just overall cultural issues? Probably 2%. But my real friends don't care about that because it's about human beings, not about who I vote for and I'll end on this. When my, I remember being in a high school civics class and coming home to my parents in 1988 and during the election and I'm like, so who are you guys going to vote for? I really wanted to know because we've been studying the candidates and my mom looked at me and she was like, none of your business. I'm like, what do you mean? I want to talk about it. She's like, we can talk about it, but it is none of your business because I want you to go determine. I think we might have lost Sage there right there, but I think what she was going to say, man, she was so great. I think what she was going to say is I want you to determine what you believe, which is what every parent should want every kid in all of America and around the world to be able to do for themselves. And if you do that, if you raise your kids, right, that's what will happen. Wish you had a little bit more energy in your day.

She wanted to make sure that all of you know that she has really enjoyed being able to talk to you. Go react. I like to say this when you hear an interview and you hear somebody and you enjoy them. Go seek them out on social media because there's lots of negativity out there at Sage Steel. You can certainly tag me at Clay Travis and maybe you were in the car and you just heard a part of that by the way, Buck on his way to Scotland. He will be in Scotland next week. We'll be back together if you're wondering where Buck was. You can react and interact with Sage, but also maybe you were in the car and you heard a part of that and you're thinking, Hey, I'd like for my kid to be able to hear that story too. It'll be up on the podcast. It'll be up on clay and Buck calm. It's one of those things that I think would probably be enjoyable to share with kids, grandkids out there her story. And I don't know what Sage is going to do. We've probably I'm sure we'll talk to her at out kick of that Fox News. We'll talk to her. I think she'll have a lot of different opportunities of places she can go. But to me, what she embodies is the idea that all of us white, black, Asian, Hispanic, gay, straight, male, female, whatever you are, however people see you, what you look like doesn't define you. All of us should have the ability to believe whatever we want to believe, regardless of what our background is. And that, to me, is what in an ideal world this show represents and what this country should represent is all of us being able to speak out loudly about exactly what we think every single day, regardless of what our background is. And that is what we are going to do on this show for as long as we're here. Thanks for hanging out. Great weekend. Clay Travis and Buck Sexton on the front lines of truth."
