    "text": " Turning Point USA is thrilled to announce our defeating the Great Reset event happening September 16th through the 17th here in 2022 in Phoenix, Arizona. Join Charlie Kirk, Steve Bannon, the Great Jack Passobic and myself, I'll be there as well. Speaking as we rally to stop this malicious plan for destroying America, we got to put a stop to it. We hope you will stand with us to fight tyranny and preserve freedom. I mean, the World Economic Forum, the Great Reset, poses one of the most dangerous threats to individual freedom. National sovereignty, divinely ordained rights and free enterprise that the world has ever seen. The Great Reset must be stopped and Turning Point USA is leading that charge. Go to reset.tpusa.com to get your tickets right now. Hope to see you there. Welcome aboard to tonight's edition of human events daily powered by Turning Point USA. I am Drew Hernandez, host of Frontlines, but I'm filling in for the Great Jack Passobic while he is on assignment. He's in Israel today, a September 6th, 2022. Today's headlines are Trump says sinister outside sources are forcing the DOJ and the FBI to do wrong things. I don't think anybody disagrees with that. And also President Biden accused a heckler of destroying democracy at a Labor Day speech he gave. I guess that's a destroying democracy now calling out a president. Biden also the administration is demanding four nations to ban conversion therapy for trans youth, the further decimation of our youth, not only here in America, but across the world. And lastly, the body of the abducted Memphis woman has been discovered and the suspect charged with first degree murder. These stories are insane. All of this and more on human events daily. And David, let me start with you. We just heard from former President Trump as he labeled the Justice Department an FBI quote, vicious monsters. And he also called President Biden an enemy of the state. Is he making one of the points that President Biden made on Thursday night? Is he making that point for him? Well, I think it was, and I think he's playing entirely for Donald Trump. And what we're seeing from Trump in these days is he's going back to his classic strategy of deflect and delay. And he's using language in these speeches, which are really hyper, I partisan kind of speeches. He's using that to deflect. When you call somebody an enemy of the state, as he has done, that in effect in our country today is regarded as treason. That's a charge of treason. Well, let's get straight into this to bring you guys back up to speed on this Intel drop. The post millennial reports that the judge has granted President Trump's request to have a special master review the Mar-a-Lago raid documents. And also Trump is saying, which is obvious that sinister outside sources are forcing the DOJ and the FBI to do wrong things. Here's some intel on this story. A judge has granted President Donald Trump's request to have a special master review. The documents seized during the Mar-a-Lago raid, the ruling, which was issued on Labor Day grants Trump the ability to stall the fast moving proceedings that have taken place since the raid on August 8th. The Trump legal team made its demand in a Florida court after the decision by another judge to release the heavily redacted affidavit, which was a joke that allowed the FBI to obtain a warrant to search the former president's residency. The federal government responded by releasing a 36 page filing that claimed to reveal new information about the extent of classified material that agents found during the raid. And also Trump's comments on this, which are clear that the FBI and the DOJ are doing some shady stuff. Former President Donald Trump said that the FBI are being pressured to do wrong things by many sinister and evil outside sources in a post to truth social on Monday. Trump made the comments after he had his request to have a special master review the documents. And Trump also criticized the FBI for searching his son, Baron's room during their raid on Mar-a-Lago while the agency ignored Hunter Biden's alleged crimes, which the president calls high crimes and treason. Is anybody surprised by this? I think it's very clear that the distraction is clearly in place. Whenever President Biden comes out and says something where he's accusing mega Republicans or anybody on the right that's mega as being a threat to democracy or a threat to freedom, I think it's a clear, clear distraction from exactly what's going on with the Biden crime family. Of course, President Biden doesn't want anybody looking into Ashley diary. Of course, President Biden doesn't want anybody looking into Hunter Biden's laptop. So you need a distraction and the distractions are perfect. Just start accusing your enemies of what you literally are. And they do this on a daily basis. It's projection. That's what they're known for doing. They paint everybody else to be a fascist. They paint everybody else to be a threat to democracy because they want the eyes off of themselves. So don't get too distracted by this stuff. Don't get too distracted by the rhetoric that according to the FBI agent that I interviewed last week that literally told me that when you hear the president come out and make these comments that anyone that's mega is a threat to democracy, that's coming from three letter intelligence agencies. That's not just coming from his own brain, which I don't think anybody believes that. And it's not just coming from the woke millennial staffers in the White House. This is coming from the federal government and the intel they claim to have to give to the sitting president of the United States of America. So yes, it's concerning that we're being accused of being fascist and a threat to democracy. But don't let that distract you from the true matters at hand. What is going on inside of your son's laptop and what is going on inside of Ashley Biden's diary? Those are the two things that this family obviously doesn't want anybody looking into. And obviously these three letter agencies have been mobilized to put a stop to anyone trying to expose that and to put a stop to any political opponents that might expose that as well, including president Trump, that is on the verge of announcing his run coming in 2024. So it makes sense to me and I think it makes sense to the viewers out there as well as to why the FBI, the DOJ is being mobilized to do evil and sinister things. It makes total sense. But don't let it distract you. Take a look at where the real evil is. If you want to know what the left's real plan is for your kids, just look at the reaction to the work Patriot Mobile did in multiple school districts in Texas. The left is losing their minds. Patriot Mobile is America's only Christian conservative mobile phone provider and a force for conservative values. This is because they take a portion of your bill and fund conservative causes and candidates who believe in the sanctity of life, freedom of speech, the Second Amendment, and they are winning. Patriot Mobile has affordable plans for you, your family, even your business. They offer the same nationwide coverage as the major carriers because they use multiple major networks. Plus, you're supporting conservative values with every single call. Go to patreon mobile dot com slash poso or call 972 Patriot. Get free activation with the offer code poso.

That's patreon mobile dot com back slash poso for work, not wealth. Let me close with this. We're a serious moment on nation history and it's not hyper. I mean it from the bottom of my heart. As I said last week, we remain in the battle for the soul of America. By the way, all right, God love you. Let them go. Let them go. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't let them go. Look, everybody's entitled to be an idiot. No, no, everybody's on it. Okay, look, extreme MAGA Republican does just threaten our personal rights and our economic security. They embrace political violence. 80 million, ladies and gentlemen, 80 million, more popular than President Obama, right? But apparently, not only is, you know, President Joe Biden getting a little disrespectful at his, you know, Labor Day speech because Biden spoke at a Labor Day event in Milwaukee, Wisconsin celebrating unions and warning workers about the dangers that mega Republicans pose to the working class. The president continued this speech warning his audience that the extreme mega Republicans were trying to take away personal rights from Americans. Here's a quote, we have to be stronger and more determined and more committed to saving American democracy. Then the mega Republicans and that guy out that door are destroying democracy, he said, referring to the heckler. Interesting, don't you think? Very interesting that, you know, the sitting president of the United States calls a heckler, an individual just calling him out during one of his speeches, a threat to democracy. I would argue that it's quite the opposite. I would say silencing an American exercising the first amendment right to literally express a grievance to the federal government. That's democracy. That's more democratic. That's constitutionally republic. That's not a threat. I would say shutting that down is the threat. But like I said, this is what these people do. They gaslight, they project, they want to be the ones that silence anyone that's coming against them or opposing them or literally in front of them that's calling them out. But they turn around and they say, no, that's actually the threat calling us out because we're big brother. You should be trusting us. We have your best interest in mind. You shouldn't even question us in any way, shape, or form. You don't need freedom of speech. Why do you need that? We're looking out for you. We should tell you what you should say. We should tell you what you should think. I mean, we're the ones that care about you more than anybody else on planet Earth, the ones that are trying to stop you from letting us think for you or speak for you. Those are the ones that are a threat to democracy. Those are the ones that want to literally threaten your freedom. Not us. We're the ones that care for you. You see how they have socially engineered millions of people to believe this. It's actually quite inverted and they've done a great job at it because you know, there's millions of woktards out there that see this and they say, yes, yes, big brother. That is the threat to democracy. Someone literally calling out a politician in real time. That's the one that's seriously the threat here. Not you, President Biden, not the one trying to silence him, not the one trying to make him look like a threat to democracy at all. The one that's actually exercising a democratic right and a constitution or a republic. No, this is what these people have done and they're very good at it because they propagate and they use fear. The greatest tactic that these people use is literally fear. They get the public to be afraid to dare step up to the President of the United States and call him out peacefully. They want to make you feel ostracized or outdated like that somehow not American to express something like that. Don't you dare come out and use your freedom of speech to call out an American politician? That's a threat to democracy because we're big brother. We are the ones that think for you and speak for you. And the moment you come out and you step out of line, that's when you become a threat. In all honesty, they're telling the truth. Drew, what do you mean they're telling the truth? In their eyes, of course, you're a threat to democracy. Of course, you're a threat to the constitutional republic. If you're thinking and speaking for yourself, just their regime and their version of the federal government they want for you. It's big brother will think for you, speak for you and literally show you what you should see. I don't know about you guys, but I don't want this. I don't have to tell you about the ultra-maga agenda attacking families in our freedoms. 300 discriminatory bills introduced in states across this country. In Texas, knocking on front doors to rats and investigate parents who are raising transgender children. In Florida, going after Mickey Mouse for God's sake. That's trying to close the home. Now, but think about this. All of you in this room know better than anyone that these attacks are real and consequential for real families. My message to all the young people, just be you. You are loved. You are heard. You are understood. You do belong. I want you to know that as your president, all of us on this stage have your back. Am I supposed to believe he cares? Not only that, it's kind of creepy. President Biden just talking about children. I don't know. It's always that same creepy vibe always. But I mean, here they are. Post Millennial, the Biden administration is to demand foreign nations to ban conversion therapy for trans youth. An internal memo from Secretary of State Antony Blenkin distributed amongst his staff claimed that the federal government was going to use American embassies in Sweden, Finland, and the UK to push these foreign countries into banning conversion therapy of youth who identify as transgender. This continued attack on children and their identities. Their biological framework transcends the United States of America. And I think it's pretty clear who's trying to push this overseas. Take a look at the current federal government trying to push the mutilation of the genitals of children. Yes, this is very graphic, but this is what these people are advocating for. They want children to mutilate their bodies thinking that it's normal. Now, why is this happening? If you peel back the layers of politics and having division over ideologies at the end of the day, this is an attack on the image of God. We are biologically made in God's image, biological male, biological female. This is a satanic attack on humanity. Period. It is a globalist, anti Christ, evil, evil, satanic attack on God, because we are made in God's image. People need to understand this is why you're seeing this. This is how far this goes. If they can engineer an entire generation to believe this very fact that you're not a biological boy. If that's how you've been born, that you're not a biological woman or female. If that's how you've been born, you could identify as a golf cart, if you want to. You can identify as God, if you want to, which, which by the way, these Tiktakers and these Gen Zers are actually doing this on Tiktok. They're coming out and identifying as God and transgender and transcendent. At this point, anything goes. Do as that will. The first commandment in the Church of Satan. That's what is being imposed on this generation. That is what they're trying to get us to accept as normal when it's not normal, when they attack this generation to get them to believe that mutilating their bodies is somehow going to be a psychological fix because you're depressed or you're suffering from anxiety or you hate the way you look, you hate the way you feel. Are those really the answers? Mutilating the body of a human being is a physical mutilation to a child. Really going to be a psychological fix. I mean, really think about what these people are advocating for. Really think about how this further damages the psychological mind frame of a child. We're not talking about adults here, a child. Think about how this psychologically damages them for the rest of their lives. And you say, Drew, how do you know that? That's not you. You don't identify as a woman. You don't have this struggle. Well, there's a lot of people coming out that went through the transitions that are going mainstream now that are coming out, making it very clear that A, they've been lied to. And B, that they had no idea what they were clearly doing when they decided to mutilate their own bodies at such a young age. And now they're coming out and saying, I feel even worse now than I did before because I was lied to. And I mutilated my body at such a young age. And I could never have a normal biological life in the future or a family ever again. That is the tragedy. That is the decimation of an entire generation. Will this generation rise and rage against this machine that's lying to them? I would say they will eventually. And that's my prayer that they wake up to this evil agenda. But it takes us to continue to push this out, expose it, call it out for what it is, and reject it wholeheartedly. At approximately 507 PM, the Memphis Police Department and other law enforcement partners discovered the remains of a body, a human body, in the rear of a vacant duplex apartment at the 1600 block of Victor Street. At that time, it was believed the unidentified body could possibly be the remains of kidnapping victim Eliza Fletcher. Further forensic investigation by the MPD traffic unit positively identified the body was in fact Eliza Fletcher. This finding marked the culmination of a four day intensive investigation incorporating a robust search and rescue effort and the timely arrest of suspect Cleota Abston on September 3rd, the day following the kidnapping. Horrific story out of Memphis. Here are some details from the post millennial. The body of abducted Memphis, heres discovered and the suspect charged with first degree murder. Here's an intel dump. The body of kindergarten teacher and mother and heiress to a hardware company, Fortune Eliza Fletcher, was discovered on Tuesday. After being reported missing in Memphis, Tennessee on Friday, she was believed to be out for a jog. Cleota Abston, 38, is alleged to be Fletcher's kidnapper and was charged with first degree murder on Tuesday morning. In the days following Fletcher's disappearance, surveillance footage was released revealing her violent abduction. Abston was soon identified as the suspect and apprehended by police. Abston was arrested after his DNA was found on a pair of sandals near the location of Fletcher's abduction. His cell phone was left in the area as well. This is not the first time Abston was or has been accused of kidnapping. In 2000, he was arrested and charged for the abduction of Memphis attorney Kemper Durand. During that incident, Abston allegedly forced Durand into the trunk of his car and drove several hours before demanding that he withdraw money from an ATM. Abston only fled after Durand called for help from a passing housing authority officer. Look how far the police lawless movement has taken us. What this done really has done in our culture is it's in bold and criminality. It's in bold and violent individuals. Those that are willing to commit arson, those that are willing to commit kidnap, those that are willing to commit murder out in broad daylight, those that are willing to put innocent lives on the line are now emboldened in our culture and our society. I mean, this is where we've been brought to because the ones when you communicate a message like that, when you communicate to the public, when you communicate to society that, hey, there's going to be a little bit leniency on those that commit crime, those that come out and want to do bad things. The ones that benefit from that are not the good guys, the ones that benefit from that are not those that are law-abiding citizens like you, the viewers, of course, you and I take a look at this and we say, what horrific criminals, they should be in prison for the rest of their lives. But because society has communicated this to fund the police message to society, those that are violent have been emboldened. Those that are willing to commit crimes have been empowered. Those that are actually lawless now see that it's a little bit easier to get away with some serious crime here in the United States of America and the ones that suffer the most are not those that are criminals. It's those that are actually law-abiding citizens, the innocent. When lawlessness abounds, that is what happens. That is the result. And that is all the time we have for tonight here at Human Events Daily. What did we talk about? Let's recap. Number one, Trump is saying the sinister outside sources are forcing the DOJ and FBI to do wrong things, which is pretty obvious. That's the deep state. Number two, President Biden is accusing a heckler of destroying democracy at his Labor Day speech. It's actually quite the opposite, literally quite the opposite. And number three, President Biden and his administration are demanding, demanding, oh, democracy, foreign nations to ban conversion therapy for trans youth. Where trans youth? I mean, it's clear that they're targeting the next generation and decimating their minds and their bodies. Lastly, we covered the body of the abducted Memphis Aries discovered and the suspect charged with first degree murder. Lawlessness is abounding. It's getting worse. We got to put a stop to this. But remember, as always, our promise, our oath, our solemn vow to you, be good, be brief, be gone. Your homework. Share this out with one of your normie friends and leave us your five star review on Apple, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts, do it now. We greatly appreciate it. But before we go, today's history break, on this day in 1909, New York Times headline announces American Explorer, Robert Perry had discovered the North Pole five months earlier. Man, it is such a shame how far the New York Times has fallen. They're clear fake news right now. They don't tell the truth. All they do is lie. We can't believe anything these people say anymore. It is a shame how far that these people have literally fallen off a cliff. And as Jack always says, you now have my permission to lay ashore."
