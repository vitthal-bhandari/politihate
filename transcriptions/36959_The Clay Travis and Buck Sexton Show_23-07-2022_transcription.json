Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Third hour of the Clay Inn Buck Show is here everybody. Thanks for rolling with us. One thing that the Biden administration does have going for it right now, I suppose. It's not like we can look at them and say that they control everything, but one good thing is we're not in the midst of a war, so that's good. The end of the Afghan war was obviously a debacle under the Obama, under the Biden administration decision making, but the situation in Ukraine has not yet brought us into conflict with Russia, so that's good. Although I don't think the Biden administration is handling that well at all. At least we're not at war. We're not going to be playing enough because as we talk about a lot of what's being done by this White House and the constant pushing of wokeness, whether it's diversity and inclusion training for all government employees and the constant focus on the issue of white privilege all throughout the federal bureaucracy, which I hear about from friends of mine who are still in, for example, the intelligence community. Oh, there's all this concern with confronting white privilege. Wait, I'm working in the intelligence community. I thought we're trying to keep America safe. I don't think I need a history lesson on white privilege every time we have some kind of HR meeting. This is very real in the the Intel community. I can tell you, which is either CIA NSA, DIA, there's 16. I think they might have even added one, but there used to be 16 intelligence agencies. There's a lot of them. The military services all have their own intelligence branch, and then there's a whole bunch of others. A lot of letters, a lot of acronyms, but they're quite woke, not only at the HR level, but also at the level of executive decision making authority. The the people that run these agencies now have been picked specifically because they go along with diversity and inclusion rhetoric and belief system. And this is true also of our military. And we are seeing something that is just by the numbers, a real challenge. Clay going forward. This is from the Associated Press. Army cuts force army cuts the force size and made unprecedented battle for recruits and unprecedented challenge in getting new recruits to join the United States military. Okay, here's what we're looking at right now. They're projecting the army. They're going to have a total force of 466,000 down from the expected 476,000. All in, it's looking like they're going to only achieve half of their goal, recruiting goal of 60,000 soldiers for this fiscal year. So they're down tens of thousands from the goal. The force structure is eventually going to have to take into account, whether it's brigade combat teams, other military formations and entities that they don't have the ability to recruit what they who they need. To fill those ranks. They're changing clay all the time now. You know, no, they're trying to change, you know, no high school diploma of any kind or GED, well, maybe we'll make an exception tattoos on your hands and your face. Maybe we'll make an exception. They're making all of these shifts body fat requirements for body fat percentage because, you know, military fighting being fit. This is all tied in together. The people who I talk to, and we have a lot of current and former war fighters in our audience and the people who I talk to say, folks who would be, you know, the guy who was the defensive tackle on the, on the college or high school football team who want to go and be an army ranger wants to be a war fighter saying, I don't want to do this. I'm not going to sign up, given what's going on here, given their firing thousands and thousands of national guard members over the vaccine, given that we're going to get constant lectures about diversity and inclusion or the threat of white supremacy from inside of the United States military, which is an actual thing that they lecture people about. I think we got a big problem here. I think it's a massive problem. And I think it's a massive problem that cuts across so many different parts of American life. Let me explain what I mean here. We want the best military possible. What's the number one goal the military that I think almost every American should agree on? We want people who can kick ass. We want people who are badasses. And when you allow the target to move from, we want ass kickers to, we want people who represent the overall population of American life. Everybody is not equally a droid and adept at serving in the military. And we shouldn't try to create a military that is designed to fulfill a cosmetic diversity quotient when it doesn't fulfill the ultimate goal that is underlying, which is to be the most proficient at kicking ass possible. And I'll tie it into a story. I don't know if you saw this this morning, Buck. It is turned into a massive story in England that there are too many white women on the English women's national team. And I saw this story and I thought it perfect. Yeah, and soccer. I saw this story and I thought to myself this perfectly epitomizes where we are as a nation. No one is arguing right now. Oh, these girls are not talented enough. The argument is they aren't diverse enough. And I want to read the, the athletic had a big story about this. And I thought it tied in well with the struggles that our military is having right now. Here is the headline that was up on the athletic, which is now owned by the New York Times. England's women's soccer team has been successful in recent years, but the team doesn't look like the country it represents. Its players are almost all white and it has a long way to go to improve diversity. Why the hell do you care what the race of the soccer team is if they're the best soccer players in the world? And there is a difference. And I think this is significant and a lot of people miss it. There's a difference between providing equal opportunity and getting equal results. You could have a completely diverse and representative football team, NFL team in America. Half of them could be women. 60% of them could be white. 13% of them could be Hispanic, 4% Asian. That team would lose every single football game they played Buck because they aren't the best possible football team. And I tie it in with our military because we are focused now not on creating the greatest fighting force in the world. We're focused on trying to make the fighting force look like America. That oftentimes doesn't correspond. And I think it's why a lot of people are not going to work in the military. I remember being in Iraq as a civilian CIA analyst many years ago and being on US military bases. And there were big placards. You know, diversity is our strength. And I mean, I remember spending time with these guys and gals and their strength was actually strength and being badasses and willing to go out there and defend each other and defend US interests and just kick some ass. I don't care what the military looks like from a demographic perspective. I want the United States military to have pilots who can shoot down Chinese fifth generation fighters, which may become a big thing for us in the years ahead. I want green borays and Navy seals and Army Rangers and an airborne who can do, you know, a hundred pushups like it's nothing carry their rucksack for 15 miles, engage the enemy, shoot them at 200 yards with iron sights. I mean, I want the best of the. And by the way, that is what our military has for a long time been producing here. It's the job. But now we're starting to see a shift in focus. And I think that shift in focus is a big part. I'm not saying it's the only part, but a big part of why it is that you have people who again are the war fighters because the other part of this is that a lot of people serve military service is military service, but there are people who are serving in much more logistics capacities, which is that's honorable service. I'm not putting that down, but they're never going to be outside the wire. They're never going to be shot at. They're never going to be in harm's way. The people who are war fighters are overwhelmingly, in my experience, the door kickers. They're people who when they're told that, you know, six year olds in school need to be lectured on trans ideology and that there needs to be, you know, mixed units of male and female infantry on the front lines, all this different gender identity stuff. They do not go along with that. I think you're a hundred percent right, Buck. And we know that our foremost enemies do not go along with that. China and Russia and Iran are not recruiting people into their militaries by advertising pronouns. That's what's going on right now in our United States military advertising. It is this woke, diversity and inclusion propaganda. And I think somebody you probably saw this. I think we even like might have texted it back and forth. The way that Russia is recruiting soldiers right now is we want the baddest ass of the bad ass. This is before I think they invaded Ukraine. But China's trying to do the same thing. And the way that we're recruiting soldiers is by saying, we're going to make sure that we respect your pronouns. And I'm sorry, if you're 17 years old and you are trying to decide what you want to do with your future, most people want to try to become elite. They want to become elite at something. There's a great deal of demand, especially in young men, to find a way to finally their bodies take their minds to a different level. All of that. They don't want to sit around and talk about pronouns of white privilege. And I think that goes across all the way, by the way, white, black, Asian, Hispanic, the badasses among us do not want to be recruited into a woke military. And I think it's a massive issue with why we're having trouble recruiting. If you're out there and you're either current, you're personally, you know, a door kicker served in the US military or you are close to people who are and you're here in the same thing or you're somebody who was kind of joined up even and said, you know what, I've decided that I'm going to drop out. I'm not going to read list. I don't want to be a part of this anymore. I'd be curious to hear about it because I hear from people who are saying this all the time that they think this is really damaging. The ethos of wokeness from the top down of the military brass is really damaging the esprita core and the recruitment of the people that you really need, which is the people who are going to run, run toward the state of the world. Run toward the sound of the machine gun fire. The woke virus destroys, and I think you use this phrase almost exactly yesterday, Buck, the woke virus destroys everything it touches and trying to turn our military into a woke military is going to destroy its fighting ability, just like it's destroying, frankly, many different companies out there from the inside. And we can either talk about this and be honest about it as we do clay, or we can wait until we lose a war. And then we're going to have a whole bunch of other problems, folks, you know, start working on your Mandarin. No doubt. Just get people who can kick ass into our military and encourage ways to get more ass kickers into our military instead of trying to tell people their pronouns matter.

My mental health meds were helping, but they led to uncontrolled movements called TD, Tardive Disconesia. It felt like my movements were in the spotlight. In Gresa, Valbenasine Capsules is a prescription medicine for adults with TD. It's the only TD treatment that's always one pill, one stailey, and it's number one prescribed. And people taking in Gresa can stay on most mental health meds. In Gresa can cause depression, suicidal thoughts or actions in patients with Huntington's disease. Pay close attention to and call your doctor if you become depressed, have sudden changes in mood, behaviors, feelings or have thoughts of suicide. Don't take in Gresa if you're allergic to its ingredients. In Gresa may cause serious side effects including angioedema, potential heart rhythm problems and abnormal movements. Report fevers, stiff muscles or problems thinking as these may be life threatening. Sleepiness is the most common side effect. Now that treatment has reduced my TD movements, it's nice. People focus more on me. Ask your doctor about In Gresa or learn more at engresa.com. That's I-N-G-R-E-Z-Z-A.com. Here's an effort that speaks to the very core of our values as Americans.

Welcome back in, Clay Travis. Buck Sexton Show. We're about to be joined by Riley Gaines, University of Kentucky Swimmer, who has been nominated for NCAA Women's Athlete of the Year. The same award, that believe it or not. A former male swimmer at the University of Pennsylvania has also been nominated for. And they swim against each other. And I think you're going to want to get your popcorn for this upcoming interview. But Buck, we were just talking. And I was curious about military enrollment, sign-ups, everything else. You went into the CIA coming out of college. Because of 9-11. If you were 21 right now, would you want to go into the military, into the CIA based on what you are seeing of the services right now? I mean, I could have a college-age child right now. I mean, I don't, but I could. And if my kid said, should I consider a career in the U.S. intelligence agency right now, I would discourage it. So I can't, I mean, I obviously haven't served in the military. People wonder how did I, the CIA was totally my idea. 9-11 happened. It was an attack on America. And it felt like obviously a call to action for a lot of us. And I just thought the best way that I could help, I had a background in Middle Eastern politics and history and was studying Arabic before 9-11 even happened. So I thought I could help by essentially finding the bad guys and sending in our war fighters to, you know, to get them and help them find the bad guys. That was just my, that was my thinking, you know. I'm going to be kind of the bird dog for our shooters to go get the bad guys. And I would not tell somebody right now go join the intelligence community. I heard this from a friend of mine, a very senior CIA officer that I had worked for left recently. And while walking out of the building said something to the effect of, I got sick of all the lectures about how I need to be sorry for being a straight white male. Which is the, I mean, again, it goes to what's the essence of your job. If you're losing talented people because you're focused on diversity and inclusion, which has nothing to do with the essence of the job, then the organization itself is failing. And John in Washington State called in, John, you spent 34 years in the military. What are you seeing and hearing from people who may be multi-generational military families? Well, I can't speak for all of them, but I was proud to serve. My father served in military. I did for 34 years. Back of duty. My son has served in military. My son-in-law, my grandson, we're basically a military family. But the military that we have nowadays is not the military that most of us served in between the vaccination mandates and all the lokeness. I think fathers and grandfathers mostly are telling their sons and daughters and grandsons and granddaughters. If asked, is don't join the military. And so I think that has a lot to do with the military, not meet and recruitment levels. Well, thanks for your service. Would you have ever believed, so you got in 34 years ago, would you ever believe that you would have been in the position of telling your kids and your grandkids, Hey, I don't think it's worth it based on the culture that's been created in the military? No, I mean, I was proud to serve as my whole family was, but it's just changed drastically. And the Afghanistan debacle was a big, big part in it. John, thank you for your service. I'm a clay. This just, oh, by the way, we have all the here we go. James in Pennsylvania. James, what are your thoughts on this 24 years active duty? Oh, do we not have James? I thought we had James James. Yes, sir. Go ahead. We got about a minute. Okay. Hey, listen, I was about to actually when I was in our, uh, to get the, with the screen away. My family and I both listened to the wrestling ball for 30 years. And I think the first time I got to talk to anybody, but as far as the military goes nowadays, there's still a lot of people out there that know this country is worth fighting for. And they're not afraid to show their colors and I have a lot of gratitude for them. And I can say this being I was a drill sergeant to for a while. And let me tell you something, the troops, when you get out there and you train them properly, they perform. Well, we got some optimism from James. Thank you for your service. There are 24 years for master sergeant. Thanks for calling in. I mean, maybe it's just the, you know, the American Patriots isn't clay is the one thing. One thing we can rely on, even if the system itself is making it harder for those folks come back to more on this with Riley gains in a moment. Thanks to people like you, the Tom of the Towers Foundation delivers on its promise to do good and never forget the sacrifices of America's greatest heroes. Heroes like Officer Familia, who couldn't wait to join the NYPD to protect her community. She proudly wore her uniform, but was ambushed and shot in line of duty solely because of that uniform. She is survived by three children, including a daughter who was 20 at the time of the murder. The daughter became the guardian and provider for her twin siblings who were 12 at the time. Thanks to your generosity, Tom to Towers gave her children a mortgage free home. Some families, the foundation brings them comfort, the comfort of knowing they can stay in the home and they made memories with a fallen loved one. For other families, the foundation enables new memories to be cherished forever. Help our nation's greatest heroes and their families. Join us in donating $11 a month to Tom of the Towers at t2t.org. That's t the number two t.org. Clay and I donate every month. Please, if you can t2t.org. Again, Buck going strong here, folks. You know, it feels like the Libs read 1984, or Wells 1984 as almost a how-to guide. You know, they've changed the Miriam Webster dictionary definition of woman to add the definition of one who identifies as a gender other than a man. That's actually now on the Miriam Webster website. So the official definition online at least changed. We have somebody who has some thoughts on the gender identity politics of the moment. Riley Gaines, University of Kentucky swimmer, who tied with Leah Thomas in the 200 yard freestyle NCAA swimming championships. Riley, thanks for being with us. Yeah, thank you guys for making some time to talk to me. Yeah, I mean, look, you know, you are the actual 200 yard freestyle women's champion. So congratulations on that. Sorry, you've had to deal with some nonsense around it. What was your first reaction to hearing that Leah Thomas was put forward by the University of Pennsylvania as NCAA woman of the year? Yeah, it was just this feeling of heartbreak. I really thought this would never happen, but of course the NCAA proved me wrong yet again. Just thinking of all those amazing female athletes that you've been who've lost out on this nomination for the most elite, the pinnacle achievement in all collegiate athletics. To someone who's only spent maybe 5% of their lives as a female, and I'll say that with quotations around it, it's incredibly just heartbreaking. Clay, what percentage of people out there in the women's swimming when you would have conversations with them would say, I completely agree with everything that you are saying, but they were terrified to actually say that publicly? Definitely the majority. Obviously, I cannot speak for absolutely everyone, but there was few encounters I had where people did not thank me or were not. I actually had a ton of Thomas's teammates reach out to me and just thank me because what they have to go through every day, they said it's really taking a toll on them. Hey, Ryan, can you tell us about that? Like what are they when they're saying what they have to go through? What are some of the things that the actual female athletes on that team are dealing with? Well, one in the locker room situation, it's incredibly uncomfortable. It just kind of puts them all in a place that they didn't sign up to be in. And so they're threatened, they're intimidated, their coaches obviously quiet them down. I actually saw an email that the Ivy League sent out to the swimmers that said, if you feel uncomfortable seeing male genitalia in the locker room, you should seek counseling. And so what an infringement. I mean, that just seems like it should be illegal. Does it not? Yeah, look, I think that's kind of crazy. And I want to circle back around on it because I think our audience may not even be aware of this. Not only does Leah Thomas get to claim that she is now a woman, but that he is a she-clay. Yeah, it's all crossed up, right? But he is using the women's locker room as well and still has male genitalia. I mean, this is crazy town stuff. Right. And under Biden's new administration of Title IX, it's actually sexual assault now to refer to a transgender as the wrong pronouns, but it is not sexual assault to have male genitalia in the female locker room. My understanding from, I saw reporting on this is that Leah Thomas still claims sexual attraction to women, right? So you're having to get undressed, if not you, because you weren't on that team, but a woman on the U-Pen team would have to be getting, you know, it's a swim team, getting fully naked next to an adult male with males in a tell you who is still attracted to women because he has long hair now. Right. I actually talked with girls who had dealt with sexual assault in the past in the locker room situation at N-Ciblaze was enough to cause enough trauma to where they actually had to seek some help again, which is just crazy we've gotten to this point. So Riley, where does this go? Because one of the big questions that's out there, you probably have heard this from people as well, is, oh, why do you care? Well, my answer was always this is leading to men taking over and beginning to dominate women's athletics because they're bigger, stronger, faster. Let's just talk about the competition element of this. I believe Leah Thomas is six foot three, six foot four. How much fairness in competition is there for you, a woman who has swim for her entire life? I bet you started when you were four or five years old training for this to suddenly be competing against someone who was a male swimmer up into a year or two ago, and now they're the greatest women swimmer ever. From a purely competitive perspective, what is that like and what advantages exist for Leah as a swimmer that do not exist for the other women you swim against? Right. So obviously there's the blatant physical advantage of just height, but that clearly is not everything. That's sort like swimming. There's certain aspects like your aerobic capacity, your capacity, all of those things, men have larger hearts, men have larger lungs. And that's not something that would ever change with testosterone, fuckers. And having those advantages, it really, really is obvious, even if you just go back and watch the race video. Riley Gaines.

Our thanks to Riley Games being willing to speak out against this insane woke universe, swimmer at the University of Kentucky. You just heard her talking about having to be forced to swim against what was a male swimmer until like a year ago. Guy still has male genitalia walking around in the locker room still attracted to women. At some point, I just continue to slam at home. If you are running or working on a campaign in a governor's race, senate race, congressional race, heck all the way down to a school board race and you're running against a Democrat. I'm just telling you one question in most of the country right now can win you the election and that is ask your opponent, can men get pregnant? Democrats want to claim to the party of science. They got dudes with male genitalia, swimming against girls getting nominated for the women's athlete of the year. What do you think Clay, the crossover is between people who won't answer the, or actually they'll say yes, men can get pregnant. People who will say yes men can get pregnant say it's not an important question. It's a distraction. They'll just evade it. But if they do answer and say yes, who also will tell you that shots five, six, seven, and eight are the ones that really kick in and protect you. Hashtag science. I think it's 100%. I think that there is a leap of faith across all science and all data and all logic. Democrats have become a party of insanity. I really mean it. And would you have ever believed that we would be in this day and age having conversations about whether or not men can get pregnant? AOC got fake arrested yesterday or fake handcuffed yesterday. She would tell you that men can get pregnant. If she were on the show with us right now, she would say it. She would mean it in her heart of hearts. She would tell you that you were a bigot for asking the question. Remember, it's not even that they're trying to win converts. They're hunting heretics. If you deviate from this, you're a bad person. They're not sitting there saying, hey, Clay and Buck, let's have a conversation about what it actually means to be a man who is pregnant. No, no, no. It's how dare you. You're a bigot. You're as bad as somebody who's a racist because you think that a uterus is necessary for having a baby. Positive. I was just reading during the commercial break. The vast majority of Americans agree with us. White Black, Asian, Hispanic, gay, straight, Democrat or Republican, honestly, that this woke virus is destroying everything it touches. And if you are actually anti-woke, if you move in the opposite direction, if you were pro America, Top Gun Maverick Buck, I was just reading one of the most successful movies ever. If you haven't seen it and you want to just be entertained for a couple of hours and get away from everything, go watch it. I guarantee you'll like it. Tom Cruise on track to make over a hundred million dollars. Yellowstone is the number one show on television. They won't nominate it for an Emmy. It's pretty decidedly anti-woke in nature. If you are willing to throw up the middle finger in the direction of the woke ideology to give it the Heisman show up into the distance, the market will reward you. We're seeing it with this show, biggest in radio. We're seeing it all over the country. Buck are Hollywood studios so committed to their ideology of wokism that they are unwilling to take all of the money that they can make by just making us decent movies and television shows that don't try to tell us America's awful and focus almost exclusively on wokityology. I worry because some of these, you look at Amazon and Netflix and these epicenters of wokeness. And what you find is that they're so dominant now in the space of content creation that it's a little bit like, okay, well, if they're the ones that can tell you what the only products are on shelf, even if you don't like them, at the end of the day, they may be able to make enough money because they control the market, which brings us back to why aren't there more conservative content creators at that level? And that's a whole big discussion. We've been having that on the right for a long time. But Clay, this has been clear for a long time. Every time, I mean, it's remarkable. Every time there's some independent studio or that make something that has, I don't know, like a history of the Bible or, you know, something that has some biblical themes in it that goes into, you know, Christianity at a positive light or just is a story about somebody whose, whose faith was inspiring or whatever. And it makes all this money at the box office. The libs are like, what movie? We didn't even, that wasn't even a movie. It didn't even exist. Didn't even happen. If they do review it, they're like, oh, this is trash. The acting is so bad. If they wanted to make money, they would look at the formula and say, let's do more of this. That kind of money, or rather, they don't want to make money doing it that way. They think they can make enough money by, you know, shoveling, wokeness and more pansexual cartoon characters at us. It's wild, but because I did this in my own life without kick. I was disgusted by the, what I call the knife fight of wokism in sports. And I know a lot of you out there are sports fans still. And you know what I'm talking about? Every media outlet, every media figure constantly lecturing you about diversity, inclusion and racism and gender issues and all this stuff. And I just made a website and founded a company where like, yeah, hey, we like sports and we're sane and we're dominating. Nobody else did it. I have an, I have an important, um, yes. And the market rewarded you handsome. Yeah, that's right. I have an update for you on the AOC, fake arrest story. I knew there was going to be some, there would be some laughable ex, cause it was so stupid. The whole thing, right? AOC tweeted this straight from the source. No faking here. Putting your hands behind your back is a best practice while detained, handcuffed or not to avoid escalating charges like resisting arrest. I mean, not only is she an imbecile. She's a fraud folks, a fraud, but she could do an Instagram live right now and there'd be more people watching her than watch MSNBC. And then I'll be saying, yeah, yes, queen. You're amazing. You're a genius. And they're all so dumb. And I feel badly for them. They should listen to this show. They would learn something. I will, I rarely pay attention to AOC, but after that, you're my favorite big booty Latina video, which was up, I think last week, right? I went into the comments and buck, the number of what appeared to be male Twitter accounts. Just it was like they were desperately asking for her to date them. When you read these comments, it's like, well, if he had said that to me and you were my girlfriend, I would have punched him right in the face. Oh, she's got like 900 likes the, the most, if you are a, a beta male with Ukraine flags and double masking selfies. And if your profile photo is you in an N95 and you announce your pronouns to everybody all the time, AOC is the dream woman. I mean, she is the absolute best you could ever imagine and hope for if you happen to be one of those guys. It is, but I just loved reading their comments because first of all, you're not going to get to date the girl that you're making the comments about in the, in the social media accounts. All right. That's not unless you're also famous and rich. She's not going to be like, you know, Mateus four, six, four, six, nine, two, three with the Ukraine flag and the triple mask profile pick. You're the guy I've been dreaming of dating forever. It's just next level pathetic. The men who are like throwing themselves at AOC's feet in the comments. I couldn't help but enjoy it. So I got to tell you folks, we have the audio action to share you tomorrow of the CEO of Starbucks who is telling everybody not only of the close 16 stores, stores that were making them money, but it is because Democrats who run different cities all over the country have decided to stop enforcing the law and more Starbucks closures are coming because these Starbucks locations are unsafe. And Buck, it's a perfect example. They ran their company for decades almost setting policies in place that made them very popular and beloved and they got woke and now they're going broke in those stores.
