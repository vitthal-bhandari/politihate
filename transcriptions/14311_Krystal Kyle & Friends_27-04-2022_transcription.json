    "text": " and we are back with an all-new episode of keep it I'm Iron Madison the third I'm Lewis Fertel and when you said we are back this time you actually meant it I'm meant I meant we because I'm here Gayle King make the style and interview still shaking hello hi guys it's me Aida I'm here hello I missed you so dearly and I'm happy to talk shit again I'm so excited that you are back if only because the DMs I get from people who are like no they're not wondering where you are anymore they want to replace you I know they're like girl we need somebody somebody there at the very least with consistency it's like when mama keep bringing new boyfriends around and it's like I don't care which one I just want a father don't drag my scorpion mother like that since you just brought up Gayle King when I think of Gayle King still years ago I friended music mogul David Geffen on Facebook just to see if I could and then he accepted which already mind-blowing and then I was like well it must not be him and then the first thing I see is a picture he's posted from his yacht in like Vanuatu or wherever he lives on that giant boat and he his friends on the boat that day are Paul McCartney and whoever his wife is at the time Oprah and Gayle which I did not know they went on like yachts together anyway it's always on my mind and then like a couple of other famous people but just wow Gayle and Oprah staycation together this is the this is the private lesbian relationship I want to hear about this is the way Houston girlfriend secret girlfriend story I want to hear so this is this is brought up three things for me one Lewis I would completely expect you to be a David Geffen yacht gay would it not be if I saw you in the background of a photo no I bit by the way how many fucking schooners have I been on zero to that Facebook story reminds me I don't know if I ever even mentioned it on here one time I think it was with like Mariah was working with like Billy Eichner doing like shit with him oh yeah I like commented on a thing and like Billy like responded to me because we're friends with Billy and then Mariah followed me on Instagram Mariah Carey followed me on Instagram must have realized her error because when I went to her page she was no longer following me oh wow but you could still see the notification like on the page that like Mariah Carey has followed you so I did screenshot that and that that is um that is even better than being followed by Mariah Carey Mariah Carey accidentally followed me on Instagram and then who was this name right and then you and it's still in fear in Mariah Carey I thought you did she backed away from that mistake faster than love her boy wait I do want to say so if you're a yacht with David Geffen gay and what like what's your what are you Ira because I would say I'm like a catamaran with Wanda Sykes gay we're going to talk about Janelle Monet and genderqueer celebs you know today and I think I'm like I miss you I miss you I'm like I feel like since maybe it doesn't count since I like actually have been there you know but like I feel like I'm a geeky at Janelle Monet is like house like in the hills get you know like a black queer celeb you know but what what what one without a vendetta it tends to be like Coraba so apparently has a talk show that just sold in like 90% of the US or something good for her and Janelle has a pool yeah now has that pool I did come at the very end of that everyday people party I did well that's well that's the party I missed you at bitch always missing in my life is your theme the only time I you know was ever outside I was she was like wait you left already I was like you know what I had a birthday party to go to yeah another plane another bus another thing my third comment was just going to be that has gail replaced Oprah the Megan Estallion interview right oh like the Megan Estallion interview with Gail I feel like I was recently talking with people about Wendy Williams and sort of like her place in culture and we don't really talk about her and Oprah in like the same breath even though they sort of like are running though like the like the daytime games like black women right but like I think it's because Oprah only now does like Harry and Megan you know like I think like this gail the one who like people go to for that chat because I feel like Megan Estallion would have been on Oprah back in the day I feel like Gail has assumed the position of doing the like kind of hard-hitting revelatory interviews like the one that we I mean my first time really clocking her as that position is a more journalistic expression was with our Kelly Robert Robert Robert Robert shifted in that moment I think Oprah has kind of gone into her spiritual a little bag where it's more so like how do you feel about getting shot in the foot and gals like girl what happens you know also I just want to say Ira you did a brief Oprah impression right there and it sounded to me like Deborah Wilson's impression of Oprah which I am I missed us for like I think we needed again Deborah Wilson come back to us we have so much to get to in this episode and Miss I eat it is that but also back to the last time back for the technically technically last time technically the last time this is like the formal we're wrapping it up so you guys understand that I've been doing a bunch of other things and I'm first of all everything you are I'm busy I would people with people try to act like where she at I'm like do you not see the she's all set y'all know y'all know where I'm at and I think but you know I was reflecting on this as without crying as much as I could a little cancer girl I owe everything that's happening in my career to keep it and to the things that don't say that no listen let me make my little argument okay let me get through it I have a proof I have a whole proof I've done because the only reason I even started working at Big Mouth and started writing for television shows was because comedians saw me going up in Los Angeles the only reason I was in Los Angeles was to be working at Keep It and to work at Crooked so I do think it was the it was an inception point for me of learning that I could be an entertainer in all different types of ways and it's very fulfilling very fulfilling I everything that we've done I just let me oh oh every interview has been like a opportunity to connect with some of my favorite people in Hollywood it's been a chance to meet with life-changing women I my interviews with Gabrielle Union and Drew Dixon have been pivotal for me and understanding who I am as a person as a black woman as a non-binary person in in the industry so girl I met Issa Rae on this podcast to be for her camera her camera was off yeah she met me she was wetting she was wetting planning she was wetting planning that day already probably tried on dresses while trying on dresses while zooming with us that's from what I've learned about her she is the person to do 15 things at once so that's probably accurate I really appreciate that if you gave a mouse a cookie trail back to keep it that you gave us but also I mean Jesus Christ like Ira and I always talk about this like we knew the minute you came on we knew you're gonna blow up into 55,000 other things so the fact that it's happening now it's like well if it wasn't now is it gonna be a month from now or two years ago or whenever it's happening now and we couldn't be more thrilled for you yeah thank you so I want everyone in the audience to know to that this is purely just scheduling issues if I could be here every single week I would be here but learning how to balance acting and writing and you know potentially producing and working on projects like that it's been it's been so difficult especially at my young dumb age so I'm learning I'm learning how to be a person I'm learning how to keep existing in this career and I thank you guys for giving me that space and still of course you know and keep it going and of course you know we'll have you back whenever you are free when you have to promote rap shit interview interview interview oh wow I'm so excited for that but we'll see who's Gayle King now exactly I mean listen Lewis done I'm gonna make him interview me when my book comes out I will be the guy I can't wait maybe I'll have to come back to that one I might be out of the country that I might be I might be dead that's don't don't maybe just host the show like I'm Mark Merrin right but you know yourself I'll a joke held around and Lady Gaga giving Donald Glover in the recent interview piece oh yeah yes I was just I couldn't think of who it was it was that's an IRA moment for sure are you are you afraid of are you afraid of black woman IRA well I'm afraid of my mother she used to own a gun so maybe I'm afraid of what I do think I'm afraid of my mother would be an amazing film noir I'm afraid of my mother yeah yeah all shadows all right all right I'm good to work on that I'm gonna say no movie any and and also I was so I didn't realize I took it for granted at the time but but you know with rap shit occupying a lot of my time last year and even now the keep it was the only reason I could actually process and meditate on what the fuck was going on around us like it had become this place for me to make jokes and stay abreast and abreast okay and you know really just talk to very very smart people the two of you are so intelligent and that is namely why people come back and keep listening and you're so funny and I learned so much from the two of you and I know we'll continue to keep learning so again thank you thank you thank you and don't expect me to be funny anymore I'm a serious actress here comes yeah Mary on Quoty Al and oh and you know what was also interesting to us I saw recently and listen to the podcast where you guys had Judith Light on and Cheryl B. Ralph and I just had gotten back from filming a movie with the two of them and when I tell you I've met it's like the hyperbolic time chamber of information I learned from just one moment with Cheryl Lee Ralph I became a I'm a sound woman now no the full circle moment we had was Judith Light recommended the work of some author I think and then seconds later I and I realized oh you were working with that woman so it was like it was like you had jumped the times the keep it time space continuum into pop culture absolutely wild guys I feel often like a weird fly on the wall that is critiquing and learning but also trying to do the thing that I've been saying that you know Zendaya can't do that well for so long like now I'm trying to figure it out and I'm like damn I was wrong I was wrong it was safer for me to be offset and it's it's it's very actualizing and it's been hard and I'm excited to keep money and keep growing it's it's strange to have seen Kirsty Clemens in 2015 in the dope movie and go wow you can be a feminine woman and look like that and then in 2022 I'm in a film with her and I play her best friend and I get to have those conversations with her about how to comport yourself as a young black woman on sets and as a number one or even as a number five or whatever your position is on the call sheet so it was cool guys it's really cool I'm living life and I'm very happy right now I love it if this is ER you're you're George Clooney that's true yeah I'm Sherry Springfield over here Jesus Christ can someone get me I'm still dealing with my sister Chloe I just help them Julie out of Margolis I mean can't you can't you can't you see me in a long-running beef with someone on a network TV drama and then we don't even shoot our final scene together yeah that's my journey that really is among the most unparalleled pop culture moments just I cannot think of anything else like that that anyway we can unpack that another day love Juliana of course and her many SAG awards I mean if we were Hollywood unlocked if we were Jason Lee we would have asked her about it all right all right well let's get to this episode we're gonna get into like I said Janelle Monet the gender queer celebs of our time we're gonna get into us being an Elon Musk America welcome and I have some sunset opinions our favorite white people and Lewis is gonna talk about some shit from the 70s as usual that's Riley and not just us we will also be joined today by Miss Sally Draper herself miss Sabrina Spellman the one and only Kiernan Shipka was on keep it this week so we will be right back with more of the show in the season 5 premiere of Facebook watches red table talk Grammy nominated singer and actor Janelle Monet stopped by the chat with host Jada Pinkett Smith Willow Smith and friend of keep it Gammie during their us personally I still have Gammie block from my Instagram stories do you have to get me don't get me don't need to see what I be posting about but I still want that connection I'm not that motherly figure in my life surprisingly during the chat they did not talk about the Oscars since we're still waiting for that we're still waiting for that red table talk episode but in this one Janelle Monet said that they now identify as non-binary the official quote I'm non binary so I don't see myself as a woman solely I feel all of my energy I feel like God is so much bigger than he or the she and I and if I am from God I am everything but I will always stand with women I will always stand with black women I just see everything that I am beyond the binary and so I believe to know money now goes as they slash she I have always considered Janelle Monet to be an actual computer so no I would say do those not sound like just lyrics to your name Monet song like straight in a row it could be that's like is that Django is that is I'm not Tavia Butler essay I think was funny about this was girl we know girl we knew from the moment you stomped out in 2010 and dressed like a stylish penguin okay in that tightrope video you chose big boy as a feature we knew he wasn't with the girls exclusively no she's not she's very a combination of Bugs Bunny in a suit and Bugs Bunny dressed as a woman that's her whole variation of fashion yeah here it but I'm so happy that she verbalized it and gave it to us and then also is using pronouns that are non-binary leaning which of course there's no like inherent worth to being like I'm she they but it's even pivotal that she comes out as they she you know there's something about coming out is non-binary now that reminds me of the old days of coming out is just gay which is to say I almost I'm not afraid for them but it's like it's like you almost have to explain yourself to people in a way that you once had to do and like the early like what does it mean that you're gay who do you hang out with like you do have to see whatever and now non-binary is let me read you the dictionary definition of what non-binary is so that you understand what it is I'm doing who I am whatever and something she probably also had to do in 2018 when she came out as pansexual and I I felt that way coming out because for those of us who felt outside of the binary we always were like there's this nagging lack of attachment to my gender I don't know how to address it but I need somebody to give me the language for it and once you hear non-by the concept of being non-binary for the first time it's like oh oh that's what this is you know but it does come with a certain set of like your front hearing a new path you have to explain what this means baby when Janelle came out as pansexual in 2018 I mean I remember I remember everyone being in a state of flux Aeon Flux if you will director Karen Kusana yes because they were like what is this word right my first introduction to the word pansexual was one of those like true life I'm in love with my car like something like that where this man was like well I'm pansexual I like to have sex with my vehicle and I was like that's see that's not me that's not me I can't be that and then Stephen King actually got me into wanting to fuck my car Christine is the most erotic film I've ever seen and that's fair I lived up your truth I read I actually want to say that people don't fuck cars enough in movies like remember the counselor Cameron Diaz just grinding her pussy on that windshield and also was there not a moment we thought she would be nominated for an Oscar for the counselor it's like guys let's look back at the history of the Oscars do you see much car fucking in there I don't see Jessica Tandy on top of her Trans Am I? That's a moment when we thought the counselor was gonna be a good movie too that's true sure it is short of and then it just turned into being pussy on a hard body but we're here it feels good like to have a dark skin black person say that they're not they're non-binary like it feels in a way that we as a people have kind of arrived because for what it's worth the Sam Smith Demi Lovato you know I'm Ann LaSenberg it I'm so happy that they were the people that kind of paved it paved the road in a public way but it has never for me at least equaled the amount of artistic work that Janelle has done like living a non-binary lifestyle mm-hmm yeah I mean that is that is the thing for me too you know because whatever I hear of an un-binary person discuss you know sort of like the fullness of you know like being themselves you know and like being able to just sort of be like like in this speech you know like if God you know made me then you know like if God is so much bigger than he or she you know then like we're everything you know and so then you know it honestly gets it gets it at weird point where you start to feel like well damn like should I be but then I feel like I definitely don't live to the full potential of my life so maybe I never will be well yeah yeah you know the fact that that's I wake up and I just don't want to do it all okay I don't want to be everything there's yeah maybe next lifetime maybe next life but it was with you take your time with it I'm interested in the shift that's happening in culture where people are taking steps to radically free themselves and what's interesting too is that sometimes being non-binary isn't necessarily like a identity decision as much as it could be like 80% of political one where you are rejecting the the binary as a whole and you want to be that you want to represent and exhibit that that kind of transcendence and I feel that coming through in Janelle Monet's explanation of it a girl was a computer she have human half computer like like you said she's been pushing this non-binary thing for a while right like she she she she came out like she came on this bitch like you know like cyborg as hell yeah the Ark Android I mean you know and Jane like all the computer shit from the beginning you know in fact no I think she's gonna pull a grace Jones soon and in her song she will actually identify as a sexual car warm mother red pull up to the bumper etc that fits for her there's another car song that she did it comes up frequently in her work anyway no wait speaking up this isn't a this isn't about non-binary blacks left welcome yeah okay good did you see Roth annual by Gerard Carmichael the stand-up special where he comes out and sort of just sits in it like it's not about in here the conclusions I came to it's I haven't come to the conclusions yet I was wondering what you guys thought about well to be fair he was sitting during the entire thing so he could do nothing but sound comedy yeah yeah that's how you know you're getting some information like well watching the special was really relieving for me because I did run into Gerard at a party a couple years ago and I tried to hit on him and I was met with zero response except for I like your shirt and I should have known at that moment because I was wearing an Alia shirt should have known right there to that boy wasn't swinging on my side you what you weren't rocking that boat you will you don't live in LA if you don't have a friend who had matched with Gerard Carmichael on Ryan in the past few years okay like the girls are new right the girls do and it's it's it's that it's it's weird right because I feel like growing up when you would sort of like quote-unquote no a celebrity is gay right it was always just sort of like that whisper network and and then there's the weird disconnect being in LA and like sort of knowing that someone was gay but like not actually knowing if like they've ever come out in there like public sphere so you just don't talk about it right and it's this understood thing like oh I get access to that because I occasionally go to that bar where he would be but you know I guess some of those people then run around and tell something like do more but yeah you know the rest of us you know dignified boulevard here or something world cut to ourselves I loved the special I thought it was I thought it was beautiful I thought it was so more funny I will say though it is intriguing that he is sort of one of the only people who could do this and that is because he is a black man I don't think that anyone else could really use a comedy special to come out like that and have it be a thing because I feel like first of all if you're a cis man and you are a comedian like so much of comedy and like the response to it now with a lot of queer comedians you know and female comedians it's sort of like this response to what's been sort of like a cis heteronormative comedic space for so long and I feel like if a white man were like I'm coming out his gay but it had like this sort of history like like a John Mulaney right if John Mulaney came out his gay now people wouldn't be sort of like excuse me or they feel some type of way about it you know was sort of like why weren't you telling us like you've had a whole TV show where you were straight you know you've had so many comedy specials etc right I feel like part of the impact of this is still couched in people's perception that it is harder to be black and gay within a black community do you get that I eat a I think I think I I totally understand what you're saying I do think though to like your John Mulaney thing that it wouldn't it would be part that why why didn't you tell us before I wish that you had been at that stage in your life but also it would just feel like self-master but worry I don't know why yes it would be a self-master but for this for Gerard I feel like maybe it's just also the way people were responding to it I felt like a lot of the responses were a lot of like oh we're glad that this black person you know can overcome like the homophobia like within this community and family to be able to untrained eye to the untrained eye like Gerard is a mass presenting straight presenting person so for him to do it for me I think the people like that of course Lil Nas X has done his work but people like that it that's when I think again like with John Mulaney like we've arrived we've gotten to the place where I feel like there's a level of equilibrium and equality and anybody looking like anything can start to speak their truth and I think what was beautiful about it too was that in the special like you were saying Lewis he's in a place of ambivalence about it he's in a place where it's created turmoil in his family it's created turmoil with his mother and now we get to kind of watch that unfold as he as he recreates his identity and like the moment I knew the moment I knew that this was really transformative for queer culture and for us was him hosting SNL and you see now he's dressing himself differently he's presenting jokes he looks great he looks great maybe the queer blow-up is real yeah but what's beautiful is he is uncomfortable being comfortable yeah somebody who has been a die-hard fan of Gerard Kaimichael for years now he's one of the main reasons I decided I wanted to do stand-up like I saw this guy who was pensive and kind of you know apathetic but still cool and black and I was like you know what I see myself in this person and I could do this too and and so I do hold him very dear to me now it is a lot in the way that we grow up you know I was like just sort of like how we're conditioned and it is sort of like very freeing like seeing you know like I celebrate sort of come out and sort of like explain their truth to us because I feel like you know that's that's sort of how I felt as a kid seeing let's come out as gay you know and now this is a new thing where you know it's like it's helping younger people definitely but I feel like you know maybe it's even helping people areaged to try and figure out who they are what's interesting it's like it's not even the same thing but it's like I saw fantastic stand-up show last night in New York Alex Edelman's show just I love Alex Edelman he is so sweet and like so fucking funny and when I saw his show his show is basically about the time that he went to sort of like a white supremacist meeting you know of like anti-Semite to like to find out what it was about right as one does and him acknowledging the privilege of him being able to do that as like a white like presenting like a Jewish person like who's like white you know what's interesting too is like what he talks about like you know like being like religion and growing up in this stand-up special he's like you know like in like if a different religion or like a different time like maybe I'd identify as bisexual you know but he's like but there's a joke where he says like now you know identify as straight but he's like I grew up in Boston so I would identify as straight with a couple of secrets which is such a funny joke but also like another thing in that realm of sort of like expressing fully like who you are as a person but who's able to do that based on their upbringing and what community they're in I would say what you wait I think something about this special this particular and I think speaks to what you were saying about why only a black man could deliver it as it is very specifically melancholy but by that I mean like you know like I can't think of another comedy special even like Nanette you come in and that's a pretty raucous atmosphere you know like she's going for broad jokes initially but the vibe of this is very we're sitting like there's jazz music playing Bob Burnham directed at it it's this very like kind of lush looking special and it starts with some jokes that are mostly pop cultural which is really how you could tell he's gay because they were all like ending on and this lady which I understand of course but the fact that it then moved into a space of just I'm sitting here and I think the audience is mostly black and it turns into kind of a conversation between the two of them too and it made his coming out feel sort of like intramural like you know it's like here I am just talking with other black people talking about my family too so it was interesting how he kind of couch the coming out in his upbringing and what to do with it now that he lives around up and around these people in I guess New York City yeah it was just it was a one-of-a-kind experience but I will say if you want to hear him be hilarious I would recommend honestly rewatching the SNL monologues that I thought the funny and that was so of the moment too like I almost feel bad in a way that that the comedy of that moment may dissipate because it's about just the Will Smith thing so you might think oh this is dated now or something it's still so funny yeah funny and he was like obligated to address that too and I think yeah right jokes about it at the end and it like was one of the best jokes we'd heard about it too yeah yeah I also do what I touch on the fact that Bob Burnham did direct this and if there's one person who does melancholy in like comedy well yeah it is him because I mean like the last I think one of the last fucking specials I saw that like Rockby was like Bob Burnham's inside Bob Burnham like his pandemic comedy special yeah yeah which again I think too with Bob Burnham is Bob Burnham is helping to shift with the structure of a stand-up special can be and what the medium can give to audience members and you know I do still have some critiques of the special as a whole I I didn't like the jokes I didn't like most of the jokes I felt like they were but this is not without intention I do feel he was trying to make it like we're in the living room with him and he's just telling us a story about his life but as somebody who appreciates like pithy sharp clever writing I didn't receive that from Gerard which is kind of something I'd been accustomed to as a listener from his first special love at the store and his HBO special eight those are so funny the S&L they are the S&L monologue is so funny and it's great that it came like the same weekend as rather than you know because yeah it wasn't funny and it's sort of it's it's funny how like when when there were the critiques of like the neck where it's like oh it wasn't funny and it's just getting into this like you know like misery porn at the end you know I'm like yeah it starts out with jokes like you called it rockets like a few minutes ago it was like it starts out with like the jokes and like pithy and like like I'm doing stand-up jokes right and there's a moment where it shifted from like the pop culture takes of the day to I'm just telling a story and it felt more like story time was or storytelling which you know is a form of like you know like stand-up in comedy but it didn't feel like a comedy special I would also say say to I eat his point I think what happens in the special is he basically sort of gives up on overly explaining himself and like because the audience starts interacting and I actually think if he filled that with more material it would have been more effective because I think we were supposed to sort of like stew in the like in the pensiveness and I think we did that for maybe a few beats too long that's what I would say about that yeah and I'm like very sensitive to kind of gratuitous looking off and looking at the camera and a little moment yeah it was kind of performed earnestness eventually yeah it was a little self-indulgent towards the end which also makes sense though with the direction because like as much as I loved inside there were certain points at the end of like inside where I was sort of like Boba and let's actually time you to wrap this up because I get yeah girl like like like I get it you're trapped in your you're trapped in your apartment we all are me too bitch I'm a human to bitch but you know as like someone like me who I instead of hating things are being irritated by the performative nature I'm gonna try and make it about what it feels like to come out as a gay person yeah like maybe those moments of forced earnestness is like me trying to get you to understand like how serious this feels but isn't how colloquial this needs to be for you to understand that's all my just make jokes like you're sitting with me and I just thought of them right now rather than have this feel like a packaged thing that I'm giving you it's just my truth that's my life of course I mean and I think if anything you know like something like that from like a black man to you know seeing that it's just been you know but it felt very much needed you know it felt very much like something that I connected to and it just sort of it makes you want to be more honest in your own like comedy and truth-telling and stories you know really it makes me want to take it all back so I can have my own special coming out as non-binary and pencil I fucked up I gave it to the girls too quickly I have nothing I'm like I'm like let me burn somebody's podcast episode so I can you know like come come out in this book be a bit more truthful be like can I can I can I go in can I go a lot of actors have done that like can I go back can I go can I can I can I shift the straight for a bit it's safe in that bitch because it is cozy and dark and warm okay I would like to use my last episode of keep it to formally say I am no longer non-binary Janelle Monet went in I am coming out okay one in one out policy yeah that's how we keep it fresh yes you you're like you don't none of that computer shit for you you are a manila boulder catch me in a couple years I'll be Elliot paging all right well we are back Lewis and I sit down with Kiernan Shipka to discuss her latest series swimming with sharks and after that it's keep it you'll know her from madman the title role in chilling adventures of Sabrina and now as the star of Roku's new series swimming with sharks please welcome Kiernan Shipka to keep it hello Kefa hi it's so nice to have you here so good to be here I'm so excited unfortunately I can never get enough of Hollywood as a horrible wretched place stories so I know I signed I would I logged in the first words of the show are in Hollywood I was like I'm in Hollywood yes let's go let's go let's ride so in the in the story it occurred to me you are basically have been fully indoctrinated with Hollywood your entire life and this story is about basically being acquainted for the first time with the horrors of how Hollywood works so I was wondering how much do you relate to this story and or do you at all I sort of was tapping into maybe the idea of Hollywood I had when I was six years old and I got I got acquainted with with a town in a way that was quite gentle and nice and obviously I had a very lucky and wonderful experience but I didn't necessarily really I didn't relate to the to the characters position in in Hollywood but I did sort of tap into I think that sort of there there is an allure to Los Angeles and Hollywood that I feel kind of never goes away or dies I don't know I live there for a very long time and I still find myself quite enchanted by it from from time to time so so it was it was like stepping into definitely very different shoes but but I could really grasp sort of the idea of being intoxicated by by that town and we filmed it in LA too which was nice it helped it was nice that it wasn't and you know if I love a Vancouver moment but it wouldn't have been the same it just wouldn't have translated the same kind of way I truly love shows set in LA that are filmed elsewhere because it's truly the funniest phenomenon to me it's really it's really funny but speaking of intoxicating tell us everything there is to know about Diane Kruger yeah just rest it up guys she's so fun it's so funny because I never met her before and she was very good friends with January Jones and is very good friends with January Jones so I felt like we had a point person which made it easier for me to sort of go in the thing that made it very easy is that my character is supposed to be in love obsessed with her so and kind of watches her from afar she is she's so chill that's the thing I mean just seeing her kind of order like a sweet green for lunch it's just effortless like there's certain things that she does that are just effortless and she's also just an ice queen in this too and she's so but she's very warm she's very warm and very sweet we had a great time I'm getting vibes of I remember Rooney Mara giving interviews about Kate Blanchett and Carol and she said it was my job to be in love with her and it turns out that's really easy to do you know it's like my job was made so easy it's funny you bring up to I mean like her friendship with January Jones and it's like what I think about Mad Men which was one of was still is one of my favorite fucking TV shows it's so interesting thinking about just like that seven years that shows on the air and then sort of like everyone's lies after it and like how have you have you been abused by I guess like January has become like one of the best people on Instagram since Mad Men and it's it is like shocking to me that that just sort of like shifted and happened at one point well the funny thing about Mad Men was that Instagram wasn't really a thing until maybe the last season people weren't that wasn't that wasn't sort of I mean maybe I got Instagram in 2013 but it didn't really feel like everyone was sort of on it it wasn't sort of a part of things and and that and then January got it the last year I remember and that's when I mean if she really she became something something else in the culture after just because of the I mean I think she's so iconic on there it's I mean well she's so funny and sort of like a cervic online and I'm just sort of like was she like sort of just always like that on set and what was it like I guess like playing her daughter and then growing up from being a kid to then being like a teenager like working with her I always looked up to her she was she was the my number one fashion icon growing up I wanted to be January Jones I I would I would buy the ug boots that she showed up to set in I would I would idolize her I would look I would every paparazzi photo that was ever taken I would look at I would dissect the outfit I would I she was like it was just so fun for me to watch her show up to set every day and she's also so kind and so lovely and then as we as I got older and our friendship became more mature I just think she's wonderful but she was truly to me icon legend my my idol you just put into perspective a moment I totally forgot about which is around 2013 like I I think I probably got Instagram around the same time too I remember January Jones was the only celebrity I followed for a while I was like oh she was a whole new part of herself on Instagram oh she's like very sarcastic or funny or whatever I didn't realize like oh this is really expanding people's brands well yeah because especially with something like madman the writing was obviously so excellent it was such a it went on for such a long time people really felt like we were our characters I mean I would walk around I would I would be six seven eight and have people come up to me and be like your mom is horrible dad is so hot and I would just kind of you kind of just get used to it but people really and do you would scoff at January on the street I mean people would not be able to differentiate us between our characters and ourselves and I think that Instagram actually really helps in that sort of one way which which is which is a which is a pro for sure mm-hmm I mean I guess what are sort of some like lasting memories or just sort of sort of what do you sort of takeaways I guess from being on a TV show where you essentially grew up on it you know it was sort of like your you're like coming of age like if someone wrote a coming of age movie or story about you it'd be like you being on madman yeah I think about it all the time I think that I I thought that maybe when I wrapped in time went on I would think about it less but I actually find myself thinking about it more because those were my formative years and it's very interesting playing someone from from the age of six to fifteen I mean all the massive so much massive stuff happens and my character was she was doing everything before I was I mean I got my TV period before my real period and first first TV cast before the real one so I felt actually like she was kind of a she's kind of my my trial girl I could I could I could sort of figure out life in a in a new sort of way but it was yeah I was like parallel growing up which was which was struck I guess it's strange if I think about it now but I knew no different and the writing of the women on that show is so thoughtful and and I think that my my character and every and and every woman on the show was written with such depth and complexity that it kind of gave me the hall pass to be a complex person in my own life like I was never scared of being dynamic because I knew that that was possible and that's what I grew up consuming so if anything I feel really lucky looking back because I I just I never really questioned myself in sort of in sort of that way and I could I could talk about it forever because it's it's my it's my childhood my experience but honestly it was so great everyone was fun it was it was wonderful everyone was so talented and I just it's where I learned everything really that I know about acting I was cool I was reacquainted recently with the fact that you played Betty Davis's daughter on which was fabulous to watch I find that to be such an underrated series period not just because of like the day and yeah June and John and Betty the ancillary characters were so good Jackie Hoffman so good oh my god Hoffman yeah and I was a Alfa Molina fabulous I would amazing stuff in there now obviously you had mad men before that but I was wondering was that still I guess an intimidating show because everybody on that show is a legend in some way absolutely it was a totally different ballgame and also when you're when I felt it was it was maybe a year or two I was probably two years after madmen wrapped in it and it's still a period piece so I wanted to make sure the character I was playing wasn't like Sally or didn't feel like that and it was something totally different and I was playing a new a new age and a new kind of girl but Susan Saran and as the coolest and made me feel very safe and loved the entire time and I yeah again a 10 out of 10 experience it was really fun such a big operation too I mean those those shoot days were were long and it felt like they had so much time to shoot a couple pages which is just very very much so a luxury is that is that not like that well that was I think that when we shot it was probably a little bit more moderate on that but we had we had time we didn't have all the time in the world but we didn't have no it was it was sort of somewhere in between oh yeah between an indie between Sabrina and and and like a an HBO show was probably madman mm-hmm well speaking of Sabrina and you know that entire like Riverdale universe um what was it like playing first of all this iconic character and then like jumping over to do like a spot on Riverdale too was it fun to like get back into the character it was so fun and also like had you any idea like what the fuck happens on Riverdale before you'd even like stepped on set because I even played Riverdale people a lot have to run Riverdale all the time you have to really keep an ear to the streets to know what the latest and the greatest this because I dropped in and I needed I needed some updates but Sabrina was great it was so fun I I've never I got my ten thousand hours in I worked so much and I feel like I again I like learned so much about how I wanted to perform doing that doing that show it was like a playground and everyone was fun and I had fun I love that character and I felt like I feel like really truly I had time to find her voice which made me very grateful because I love the voice that I found and then hopping into Riverdale was so fun because I felt like I knew her and I'm gonna go back again I'm gonna do it again and I feel like it was almost like riding a bike when I got the Riverdale sides and I started saying them out loud I kind of feel like whoa I'm back in this back in this body it was it was sensory memory kind of stuff I mean you've done a lot of period stuff to and then you have like a lot of like horror shit too you know so I'm like what kind of stuff what kind of stuff do you like to watch I've been watching a lot of movies lately I like a I like a drama I like I mean I before sunset before midnight but that kind of like painful making romance drama is sort of probably my favorite my favorite watch as of late that that energy that kind of normal people II yeah that is still romance is sort of sort of what I gravitate toward when I when I get emotionally moved by stuff that is still what that is still like my cultural blind spot by the way the before I say before my god there it's a watch about that they like you put in one and bite like it feels like seconds later you watched all three and also I mean even hockey fabulous Julie Delphi in particular like she is the one who really elevates it to this place of like I am talking to a sophisticated person who is taking me on a journey just by being herself it's it's they're so good they're so good second the second one's my favorite yes definitely also I mean we got to be do we love an 81 minute movie or whatever it is and it's just like yeah so beautifully shot to yeah yeah gorgeous cinematic European that's right you could watch it on your flight Ira I said well one of the main problem I'm gonna have to actually download it because one of the problems is every time I've been on a flight they have like the second or third film in the trilogy they never have the first yeah that's that's a bummer and I feel like I can't rush a lot of different yeah you definitely do not no no no no watching those backwards incorrect normal bad idea normal people is also very good too I have friends who have especially watched that a few times yeah I mean I feel like you've worked with so many just sort of like actors like like we said who are sort of like giants you know too like what do you sort of what sort of like a takeaway you've learned from like working with people like Susan Saranda and I'm like what's your diet and Grover like what you want to take into roles that you want to do or stuff you're interested in I think what I've what I've observed with a lot of actors that I admire is that they aren't afraid to kind of find the scene and I think as someone who tends to be a perfectionist to a fault I want to go in feeling like I've got it and being able to trust that you can get there and that almost makes it more rewarding and better is is something that I think about a lot lately like I see a lot of actors to say hey this isn't this isn't working let's let's figure this out and I kind of have a few sometimes I find that I have a fear of of doing that because I just want everything to to work but what I've noticed is that when when people really care about something and when they want it to when they want to bring it to life it's it becomes a genuine collaboration and that is something that I've sort of taken with me as I've gotten older and and put into my work is just not being afraid to ask questions and find something and and not not be scared of finding something that's that's actually part of the process that's that's that's part of the drill that's interesting does that mean you in general feel a little bit obligated to speed things along when you're making a show or like not not ask questions just be like well it's written perfectly on the page I better just say it as is well I mean I think that also comes from Madman is that it kind of was so not a lot of us have asked a lot of questions. Ten years of it actually being kind of perfect and everyone's sort of knowing their place and knowing the characters so well it was such a well-oiled machine in that kind of way not to say that certain scenes didn't need to be finessed or finagled in some sort of way but it really did feel like you could show up and put your best foot forward and everyone else was doing the same thing and voila you've got you've got a show but with with a lot of other things it's different I've written not to say that other things are fantastic but you just it's a different process and sometimes it takes a little bit more digging to get to the sort of core of what the what the scene means. I think it's Madman. I think it's interesting is I feel like in a lot of the shows you've done you've been like the primary or only young person on a show and that would strike me as isolating generally speaking I'm sure a lot of your like schooling was done on your own etc. Did you have to go through specific measures to make sure you like new other people your age? It was an active pursuit. It was an active pursuit to find people my age but I think because I was so adamant about having friends that were in my age range I actually I made it happen in a way that felt like I chose my friends and it was authentic instead of I didn't go to a traditional school so it was all through extra curricular things so I never felt like I fell into a friend group that I didn't like. I kind of kind of hung out with all the people that truly make me happy and no I did it. I met Weiner who created Madman he had sons that were close to my age and one of them threw a party when he was out of town when I was maybe 14 and I went and the cops busted it and I was like at my boss's house and the cops were busting his party and it truly felt like that was a that was a portrait of my my life at the time was going to high school parties but at your boss's house. I mean it's been so long since Madman now you know like I remember all of the chatter after the show was ending was first of all it's amazing that you became like you were just like Don Draper's daughter on the show and then you essentially became like one of the main characters within like the last couple seasons. I feel like that's why so many people were just sort of like we want this show to keep going you know we want to see what Sally's doing like after things like what were your feelings about that then I assume you probably were just like I would like to do something new and what are your feelings about like even revisiting that world now or do you think about like what your characters up to like does the character get that seeped into your brain where you're like wondering what Sally Draper's doing you know like now. For sure for sure I think when it ended I wanted to remove myself from not remove myself from it but step away and find new things and and figure out who I was as a person and I think I knew I needed time but now I'm ready I'm ready to see her again I'm ready to see what she's up to I feel like I have so many ideas for what she would be doing and obviously the way I'm so curious to see how how affected she she would be by the way she was raised because we sort of we sort of left her at a very interesting point in her life where I think things would have just started to have really shifted and and to see her maybe in her mid 20s doing whatever she would be doing is extraordinarily appealing to me truly a wild story game she would be yeah she had a yeah she and I think she would be letting loose yeah I think she would be well I don't think she'd be well at all but in a good way in a fun way all right I'm waiting for like better call Sally to go I'm ready I'm ready Glenn can come back it can be oh my god Glenn I mean that the hair scene oh my god from oh my god January Jones unforgettable unforgettable now do you have a favorite character on mad men that you never got to interact with because I think that's also a show where like yeah you are basically you know part of this family so you didn't get to like go to Sterling Cooper Draper price at all I know I had maybe two or I maybe two or three office visit episodes and those were that I was like candy to me that was the most fun because I got to have these tiny little interactions with people that I never interacted with it almost felt like I was doing a crossover it was like a different show I mean I'm a Peggy Olson Stan of course through and I feel like Peggy and Sally what would get coffee and would have a great great time together I mean I gosh everyone in the office Pete Campbell I mean I think that would be so funny to see them interact together Joan Joan was probably one of my favorite characters though oh duh I'm a young girl I said before it's crazy to me that Vincent Carthizer never got an Emmy nomination because he is the diff that characters the definitive douchebag in the history of television genius Vinny K the best he's I love him so much and my friend is this randomly extraordinarily obsessed with Vincent Carthizer and I asked him a year ago maybe it was two years ago I it was her birthday and I said hey many you know hope you're well my friend is a huge fan would you mind maybe I don't know making her like a tiny little video he sent like a two minute voice note that is truly out of this world he's he's wonderful we need we need more of him in this world I think he seems like a genuine cuke to wish I thought yeah yeah definitely definitely eccentric nobody nobody's like legitimately weird anymore I crave I know I thought with him on angel to I fell in love with him on angel which I feel like you know like good up he had the most controversial storyline on that show and so people were happy to love him on that then but yeah great character great actor never seen a hairline he would shave it he would shave it he committed to the bit Wow I hope his hair grew back I know me too I should send him some Vivis gal or whatever supplements are on the market these days well it's so nice to talk to you Karen it's a pleasure but some we all have to go to San with senty bungalows in Los Angeles when when everyone's in the same place I would love to get a ride Martina whatever I've been there one time it was lovely it's really a fixture if our listeners kid or I are both friends with Sam last year who's been on keep it by the way yeah yeah and he loves loves a dinner loves a lunch at the same time he loves we all do it's where we exist mostly who's like who's like one of the most interesting people you've seen oh my gosh I mean I feel like everyone that goes there is is I feel like tower bars actually where more of the sightings are these days though in LA S.B.B.B. kind of has the rotation of regular people that you see and actors are kind of around and that's like the there's some wild cars I feel like you get a very a very pop star energy at at tower bar it's like it's like Dylan McDermott and do a leap up like there's a broad spectrum team at tower bar that I kind of live for always so broad it makes me so happy I believe that's the only place I've ever had baked Alaska either which by the way I recommend it I love a meringue yes a torch yeah right dessert should be on fire yes I think so well now I've got to go to tower bars so I can make Dylan McDermott and do a leap up star I swear to god I'm gonna be remade I'd love this all right thank you so much for being here it was a pleasure and we're back with our favorite segment of the episode it's keep it I think I love bone to pick with some of you bitches pick those bones I thought you were I thought you were referring to me I was talking about my hair I'm on the show with you can go either bitches but only the ones who felt the need to try it do you ever tag me and be like I guess I was just gonna flirt with Alexander Scarsgard this whole interview huh I want to say he started it all right from the job I brought out running into him at the 2016 like MTV movie awards and he was like oh the one he was like was I wearing any pants then that's when I presented without pants I'm like sir what do you and yet you didn't bring up passing so you're dead to me yeah you know what I actually forgot to bring up I forgot to bring up the story about him almost the hitting Greta Thurgberg with his bike which is what Norsemen on Norseman crime just just biking and almost ran into her because you know I mean you know they all be hanging out the biking Vikings oh no they'll be hanging out you know like like in Smurflands or whatever are the Spurs right the Spurs like Belgium yeah they're not Scandinavia they're Belgian blue from the lack of stuff why did you know that I asked that about most things I know but yeah well just like their cousin Tintin you're telling a truth you're not joking yeah they're Belgian okay I will say there's the one thing I love well before they started to have before they started to sell them in the US the one thing I loved about like going over to Europe all the time was seeing like the smurf Harry bow you would only see that like the Harry bow like the Harry Bo Gummy bears oh right right there they would only used to see the smurf ones like in Europe but now they sell them here in like specialty stores but they have so many different flavors of Harry Bo Gummies in Europe it is beautiful it's beautiful okay it's beautiful we can talk about the implications of Gargamel is a character some other time anyway what's your key bet Gargamel lost the election in France so yeah Lewis we're gonna start with your keep it for it I think I eat it has to go last this week that's true that's true my keep it is Twitter related and I have the feeling the conversation won't end about Twitter after I'm done with my keep but but it's regarding a conversation about Steve Martin's famous King Tut sketch from late 70s SNL which very relevant some Gen Z are yes right right tip of everybody's tongue everybody wants that Lord Carnarvon Howard Carter humor so okay I guess the deal is people from Gen Z discovered this sketch and found it pretty hokey and unfunny and at the time it was basically a sensation like almost everything Steve Martin did people were just fucking obsessed with it at the time here's the thing okay they're right it is not that funny I mean I just it's him dancing like King Tut and pointing around and being silly I get that it's like not laden with brilliant humor but at the same time if you're gonna post that clip you also have to post first of all the introduction to the clip which he begins in a very kind of serious earnest way that leads into the silliness so there's like a little bit of a preamble secondly you have to understand at the time the news cycle around King Tut was basically unthinkably sensational we would not have anything like this now this there was this tour of this museum exhibit where King Tut's remains were shipped everywhere and people were obsessed with it they couldn't believe they got to like experience ancient Egypt at all let alone King Tut and so to be really irreverent about this kind of solemnly amazing moment was I think really novel to people at the time and also I think what Steve Martin once was in the comedy world is kind of lost to current audiences we know him as like a lightly sarcastic relatable dad type but at the time he was so goofy in an unexpected way he's like a former like Six Flags banjo performer or something Disneyland banjo performer and people were just blown away at his kind of mix of silliness and like fun self-absorption so I think you had to be also wrapped up in who he was at the time anyway wrapped up yeah I was just to let it go best as co-star yes right a lot of people keep saying about her they're like oh she's gonna get that nomination this year I'm like guys are you sure I never even think about her on that show but moving on I told you that I prefer her comedy stylings and acting and I think she's actually like really fucking funny like on was a way really plays they actually didn't give her anything to do in season one of only murders of the building and I hope that changes what season two there's plenty about 70s SNL that does not hold up and I hope this leads to further conversations about the fucking blues brothers or the fucking B costumes that are not funny at all or the samurai you'll the yeah what the samurai is just somebody being loud it's so bad mm-hmm I would I would say samurai delicatess and look him all up yeah it's wild that you reminded me of like how King Tut had a chokehold on us when we were young maybe you miss some of this aida but I did miss miss it but I did recently also discover the bangles song walk like an interview like what were you all doing that's going on that you needed that dance maybe this is maybe this is maybe this is like anti-blackness but like I feel like in the 90s specifically like what kids were learning about black kids were learning about King Tut and the Egyptians and shit you know like everyone like was like you know like oh are we all descended from like King Tut and the Egyptians and everyone sort of wanted to claim like an ancestry as like Egyptian rather than like anywhere else in Africa you know I did a whole book I did a whole school report in third grade about big from Egypt good because because like our teacher our teacher had everyone do like a report on their heritage and people doing reports are like Vikings you know like the Scandinavians and you know like Germany but somehow leaving off the Nazi shit and so I was like you know what I came you know from the pyramids I was working in the I don't think so Marshall yeah no one called me out on it well here I am now consider you calls okay that was before 23 and me Lewis okay black people just didn't got no that's true okay that's true either it was the beginning to send it from a slave American or the actual Pharaoh so you sound like a real history kid burns watch out all right Ira what's your keypad by keep it this week goes to Christine Quinn on selling sunset now that's a TV Christine get selling sunset is back it's everyone's favorite Netflix show were absolutely nothing happens but these blonde women are so captivating and so funny unintentionally and sometimes funny intentionally you know we've had the lovely crescendo on the show unfortunately I do have to fast-forward most of her scenes the season because she is rubbing the head of Jason one of the owners yeah we are one of the owners of the Oppenheim groups head a bit too much they're dating this season but we also already know that they've already broken up in real life so watching so annoying I reality show knowing what will happen that's like okay like the net place I don't need all this keep it moving but let me tell you something about Christine Quinn she is the purported villain of the show you know like she everyone's always talking about how like she's so fashionable she should be on real house was a Beverly Hills like she just because like she's basically a bitch to everybody and she is an awful television villain and I need people to know that she is awful as a TV villain first of all the fashions are that great she just wears labels she just walks around in labels and like designer bags and like there's no rhyme or reason to what she's wearing so like the styling isn't even there like it's just it's sort of like worse than like when Erica Jane used to walk around like looking like a you know looking like a Barbie that felt like off a Mattel truck you know so like this is really bad fashion and it's also she really is just like a miserable rude person to everyone that she works with and the problem with that is this isn't bravo like you're not going toe-to-toe with like Kenyamor Neenie Leaks you know like you're not fighting with Erica Jane you know in Lisa Rina like you like these women are are timid and like sweet and like don't want that kind of confrontation like if you call someone a bitch they're not gonna give you that they're not gonna keep they're not gonna keep that same energy and this is season five of the show and at this point if you're gonna be the villain of the show you got to switch up the energy because what's actually happened it's like nobody wants to film with her ass and so like you're just on an island and so you're not actually villainizing anybody you're just sort of making people uncomfortable and when she does make people uncomfortable she just sort of like makes up stories and like tries to be a victim and cries about it and like well like she flees an event this season because people are sort of like ruining her work event what about ruining her work event okay this event that's being taped for TV it was in a real work event girl and she's like goes downstairs she's crying and she's like I just felt like I wish like you could all be professional I'm like okay it's not professional like selling stories about your co-workers so the tabloids either girl so which is it are you gonna be a villain or are you gonna be a victim that's the part that's always lost on me is where's Oppenheimer HR because it's like a co-workers these people you supposed to be making money with sometimes against I mean they are real estate agents but it's like you guys work together you can't burn all these bridges all the way down right and then they talk about getting rid of her firing her I'm like okay there's plenty of people on the show who have not even sold a damn house in five seasons so what are we doing here I do want office space I do want to say I'm obsessed with the new girl on the show the first black girl Chelsea who is British Nigerian her accent is giving an Adelvie there's some Bjork in it so there's some Bjork in it so I thought I I thought you're calling the wire the garlic I promise I promise we never talked about that show but what an awful TV show anyway I eat up what it's your key fit okay guys this is a this is perfect for a potentially final keep it because Twitter is my home my breeding grounds and where I handle all my dirtiest work I will be back you will be back because free speech is up yes okay all right me me and the free thinkers will be returning to the app okay alas democracy I've been having a lot of fun on the truth app but it's time to come back that's my that's my keep it my keep it is the Twitter being bought by Elon Musk so we off Twitter we now tweet is a solid keep it yeah and this Elon Musk bought Twitter on Monday for 44 billion dollars which might seem like a lot of money but remember Tesla is worth a trillion dollars and SpaceX is worth a hundred billion so this is still kind of chum-changer and I owe Sally May 600 billion so right and they will never be getting for a while look I'm not prepared for a world where Elon Musk owns the place where I make pussy jokes okay I'm not prepared for a world where Grimes is going to consolidate all of our Twitter typos and name her next alien baby like that no you don't get that for free honey you don't get that for free I don't want to live there in buying Twitter so Elon's been so critical of Twitter in the past even though that little hoe can't stay off it he can't stay off it he said let me find this quote he said free speech is the bedrock of democracy and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated mmm better not be matters of those Nicki Minaj's Nicki Minaj's burst on bedrock is the bedrock of our community first of all put that pussy on his sideburns okay that's what we talked about this exactly what do we talk about on Twitter we talk about Cali which is in a mughler suit do we like it Sean Mendez oh he's sad now are we okay with that those videos you guys keep calling Sydney Sweeney ugly on Twitter leave that girl alone that's what we talk about on Twitter nobody's opinions are being changed on that app this is not fucking Athens it's social media like the way the way Elon Musk and people of the like the free speech libertarian like we make money that's all we do hyper capitalist they think that the internet is a world where like actual dialogue can happen insightful dialogue girl nothing is happening on Twitter nothing is happening on Twitter like that also can I just say I'm a lot of people been dragging old Elon Musk tweets that are like bad jokes whatever and it just hurts the soul to realize that someone that fucking powerful is still obsessed with being funny like it's it's like so like it's not your job and yet it's there's something about being like a straight man and people being like wrapped up and how how funny they think you are that's like super attractive just it's like sad to me it's like you need this weird validation and that's a part of your obsession with Twitter because by the way historically Elon Musk has said things like if if the UN outlines a world or a plan to end world hunger that cost this amount of money I'll pay for it and they did it and then he went and not and then didn't pay pay for it and then went and bought Twitter instead so he's just this weird juvenile you know Marvin the Martian type Wily Coyote asshole who could be doing a lot more with the money he's and his fact has threatened to do a lot more with the money he has and is instead just buying Twitter but I just want to say about Twitter in general that Aida does fabulous work on it and I know we think of her as like you know show we say an envelope pushing you know vulgar comedian but there's a tweet of hers that I want to read here that I think puts into perspective you know the soul of Aida I hope we can enjoy it together I'm shaking in my little here we go you got to pinch the clit and suck it like a blunt roach that's so nice education I'm putting it on a pillow I'm laying down on it you thought I was gonna give you an inspirational Aida quote come on I really thought over I was like over time I'll age and mature into like a poetic understanding of self that will translate to my Twitter but it's still just shit like that and I'm gonna be 20 I'm gonna be 25 in July okay it's not going away also I just want to say that Aida is also the queen of lowercase Twitter there's there's something about like the way people abuse lowercase that I can find over over done but it's you speak in lowercase in a way it's very it's very e-commings with me emphasis on the comings it's just weird breed of like smart but stupid right okay and then lastly lastly I just want to say I don't I don't know what his impetus for doing this is and that's what scares me is because like Twitter is not a very profitable place as an app there's only 400 million people on Twitter and 200 of them are Russian bots so I don't know what he's going to come she wants to clean that out and make this a safe space for us and my just I don't I I fear I fear that people like Donald Trump and Ira will be invited back onto the app and that is not a world we need it's truly not I give into the joke about like returning back Twitter but like my life has been great since I love Twitter and you got political chaos I write actually I actually did not be on that yeah I actually did cause political misinformation it was yeah if I'm allowed to come back what's next right my heart goes out to the employees of Twitter that have now worked for Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk you are a statesman you are a patriot I want to close this out with two of my favorite I you to quote on Twitter guys why are we doing this I'm trying to at this point I think Kevin Hart just wants dick what I need a shock to her own tweet and my absolute favorite don't burp after you suck dick and then swallow that's why we got ghosts okay it feels kind of ghost for me to be laughing but I really dissociate I tweeted it that really is just in a sound actually a friend who sent me that tweet I did to find my favorite Iida tweets all I had to do was go into a message and search Iida because people always send me your tweet I love that I love that guys we did it we did our final that keep it together watch maybe like can I guess go host next week I mean also you do you really have like made your mark on this show we're really going to miss you and we're also letting our listeners though we're not doing the guest host merry-go-round sweep steaks any more you know keep it will just become keep it with Ira and Lewis after this how could we possibly replace you we sincerely it would feel contrived you are one of a kind and rad as I'd also the amount of questions I get about you just from people on the street being like what's up with her and I'm in the answer is always everything everything is happening everywhere all at once all at once everything everywhere I need a one Daniel Daniel Daniel guys thank you so much this has been a blast and amazing I want to say to something years of my life and I
