    "text": " Welcome to the Meghan Kelly Show, your home for open, honest, and provocative conversations. Hey everyone, I'm Meghan Kelly. Welcome to the Meghan Kelly Show. We begin today with Alex Jones. A jury in Texas has handed down a nearly 50 million dollar judgment against him, 4.1 million in compensatory damages, meaning what it would take to cover the plaintiff's actual damages in the form of therapy, bills, and so on, and 45.2 million in punitive damages. The damages awarded to punishment defendant and defer deter future misconduct. The punitive damages award may be reduced as Texas has a punitive damages cap of 750,000 per plaintiff. There are two plaintiffs in this case, so that would be 1.5 million. Though the plaintiff's attorney Mark Bankston has said he will challenge the constitutionality of that damages cap if necessary here. A jury awarded the sums after sitting for a trial that was all about damages. Alex Jones's liability to the plaintiff was settled last year after Jones so continuously refused to comply with discovery mandates, court orders, and basic rules of litigation in the liability phase that this judge and two others, by the way, issued a default judgment against him, finding Jones in contempt of court, stating that nothing had worked thus far to force Alex Jones to comply with the court's many orders and concluding that he had forfeited his right to a trial on liability. This particular case in Austin, Texas, where Jones's info wars is based, was filed by Neil Hesselon and Scarlet Lewis, the parents of six year old Jesse Lewis, who was murdered in his first grade classroom at Sandy Hook Elementary, along with 19 other first graders and six adults on December 14, 2012, 11 days before Christmas. I covered that mass shooting that day while live on the air for Fox News Channel. I was then pregnant with my third child, Thatcher, who would be born the following summer. I remember getting ready for the show as the news broke, and my executive producer, knowing I had a three year old and a one year old and was pregnant with a third child called me to prepare me for the job that was ahead. This is going to be a bad one, darling, he said to me. We had covered many mass shootings before, though nothing, nothing would prepare me for the horrors of Sandy Hook. I remember I called one of my closest friends, Janice Dean, who would later become Godmother to that as yet unborn son of mine, and we cried and we watched the preliminary reports of the death toll rising, and I asked her, how am I going to do this, JD? How can I go on the air and do this? And she assured me that we would get through it and that I would, I would, I would keep it together because the audience needed me to. And that is what happened, as I sat on the air for hours that day reporting the shocking, awful details as they came in. Two months later, Neil Hesselon testified before Congress. And I was on the air that day too. We intended to take just some of his remarks, but as we watched Neil, our team realized there is only one thing our audience needs to hear from us today, and that is the full testimony of this man, a gun owner who had serious questions about how this evil shooter was allowed access to an AR-15. Questions were still asking in the society, not necessarily about guns in general, but about how did he get access to AR-15 and AR-15. How did the parent, how did the mother allow it? Neil's testimony that day was passionate, it was honest, it was raw, and here's a bit of Neil describing what he had learned about his son's Jesse's actions in class that day. He was invaded by several of the surviving students that Jesse healed, run, run now. His fatal shot was in his forehead. When he went in, right at his hairline, exited directly behind that, Jesse looked at coward Adam Lins in the eyes, saw his face, and he looked at the end of that barrel. Jesse didn't run, Jesse didn't turn his back. That was the fatal shot that killed Jesse. I later met Neil. I had him on the show, I got to know many of the new town or Sandy Hook families. I always felt a connection to them because of my own experience covering them on the air that day, and the many follow-up interviews and pieces that we did on them, and with them. I came to know Neil Hesselon as a gentle, kind soul, a soft-spoken, thoughtful man who was never consumed with bitterness, but instead wanted to do justice to his young son's memory, and to honor Scarlet, too, in her relationship with their son. It was that Neil and Scarlet who just won their case against Alex Jones. The lawsuit they filed was for defamation because you see Alex Jones had a very different reaction to Sandy Hook than most of us. Instead of offering empathy for the families, he called them liars, crisis actors, and accused them of being part of a government conspiracy. He set it over and over and over again for years, and Alex Jones had a very big audience for those lies, some of whom began harassing the grieving parents as the alleged perpetrators of a hoax. One woman was sentenced to five months in prison for her death threats against another new town dad, Leonard Posner. Leonard's son Noah, who was the youngest of the new town victims, he had just turned six, three weeks earlier, had his job blown up. The first woman was shot off by the Sandy Hook shooter. Leonard opted for an open casket so people could see what was done to his baby. Alex Jones perpetuated the lie that Leonard was a crisis actor, and it faked the death of his son Noah. Posner, too, is suing Alex Jones in a different court. Accusations and horrific lies about them and their dead children eventually led several of the new town parents to file lawsuits against Alex Jones, claiming what we all, while we all enjoy a First Amendment right to our beliefs, our beliefs, repeated lies, impugning the character of another have long been recognized as unprotected speech. That's why, by the way, Johnny Depp just won a defamation claim against Amber Heard. She claimed she had a First Amendment right to say whatever she wanted about Johnny Depp, a court in a jury in Virginia found otherwise, and the same lesson was just provided to Alex Jones. Of the four cases filed against Jones, this one, in particular, held a personal interest for me, because it was connected to my own interview of Alex Jones, I sat down with him then while at NBC News for a lengthy profile. You may remember there was considerable backlash to my doing that interview at all. A small minority of the new town families objected to our, quote, platforming, Alex Jones, and objections shared by many, particularly on the left. Bill de Blasio attacked me. Brian Stelter had the nerve to suggest that no one would ever appear on any show I would ever do again, and the left-wing press was generally apoplectic about it. For the record, though NBC News would not let me publicly defend myself at the time, the truth is that the vast majority of new town parents were either openly in favor of that interview or had no objection to it, though you would never have known that from the way the media covered it at the time. Very few of these so-called journalists attacking me for doing this piece stopped to defend journalistic principles like, we don't only get to interview the good guys. Diane Sawyer interviewed Charles Manson and Jeffrey Dahmer. Mike Wallace sat down with the Iranian Ayatollah and the head of the KKK while he was wearing a hood. People considered those huge gets. Alex Jones has unquestionably said some outrageous and offensive things, but he has not killed anyone. The controversy was based more on the fact that I was sitting down with Alex Jones as a former Fox News anchor now at NBC, something many on both sides of the political aisle, resented. After all, several major publications from the New York Times to the BBC to HBO, Esquire, and CNN had interviewed Alex Jones before my sit down with him and after his claims about Sandy Hook, and there was zero objection about platforming. The amount of incoming we received for that interview was overwhelming. I'm not going to lie, it was extremely stressful for me. I had people even on the right who I liked, giving me a very hard time for doing it. I was on the cover of the National Enquirer as the world's most hated mom for doing that piece. A woman named Kristen Lemkow, a senior executive at JPMorgan, and it turns out a far-left progressive activist, Paul JPMorgan's ads from the show in advance saying she was repulsed by our decision. I'm repulsed by you, Ms. Lemkow, and your moronic understanding of what journalists do, along with your egregious misjudgment of what that interview would ultimately mean for Alex Jones and the Newtown families. At no point did I ever consider not airing the interview, nor to its credit, did NBC News. When I traveled to Austin, Texas to interview Jones, it became very clear that he had not backed away from his claims that this was all a hoax. He claimed that he had just wanted to examine, quote, both sides. Both sides, he said, the belief that Sandy Hook happened and the belief that it hadn't. But Sandy Hook did happen, and Jones's suggestion that there was any evidence to the contrary was and remains a pernicious lie. You said, the whole thing is a giant hoax. How do you deal with the total hoax? It took me about a year with Sandy Hook to come to grips with the fact that the whole thing was fake. I did deep research, and my gosh, it just pretty much didn't happen. At that point, and I do think there's some cover up and some manipulation, that is pretty much what I believe. But then I was also going into Devil's Advocate, but then we know there's mass shootings and these things happen. So, again, you're trying to have it always, right? No, I'm not. If you wrongly went out there and said it was a hoax, that's wrong. But what I already answered your question was listeners and other people are covering this. I didn't create that story. Alex, the parents, one after the other, devastated the dead bodies that the coroner autopsy. And they blocked all that, and they won't release any of it. That's unprecedented. I love the parents decided to come out and lie about their dead children. I didn't say that. What happened to the children? I will sit there on the air and look at every position and play Devil's Advocate. Was that Devil's Advocate? The whole thing is a giant hoax. The whole thing was fake. Yes, because I remember in even that day, I got back from memory, then saying, but then some of it looks like it's real. What do you do when they've got the kids going in circles and out of the building with their hands up? I've watched the footage and it looks like a drill. When you say parents faked their children's death, people get very angry. Well, let's all I know, but they don't get angry about the half million dead Iraqis from the sanctions or they don't get angry about all the illegal. That's a dodge. No, no, it's not a dodge. The media never covers all the evil wars that's promoted. That doesn't excuse what you did and said about New Town. Here's the difference. Here's the difference. I looked at all the angles of New Town. Once I was back in New York, I knew we needed a response from the New Town families, so I asked Neil. Typically gracious, he agreed. And in a gripping exchange, he made clear what had happened to his son that day. I lost my son. I buried my son. I held my son with a bullet hole through his head. I dropped him off in 904. That's when we dropped him off at school with his book bag. Hours later, I was taking him off and a body bag. Alex Jones and Innofoeville Wars responded to that interview. By doubling down on their lies about the Sandy Hook parents, including Neil by name. They claimed it was impossible for him to hold his dead son Jesse because the medical examiner, they claimed, had not released the bodies or some other nonsense. All lies and Innofoeville employee Owen Shrier admitted on the stand that he had failed to check any of these facts, though Alex Jones claimed it was all fact-checked, before saying these lies on the air. And those lies told about Neil after our interview, after Alex Jones listened to Neil talk about holding his dead son formed the basis for that lawsuit that just resulted in a $50 million judgment against Alex Jones last week. Here is the New York Times Daily podcast called The Daily this morning. A specific claim of defamation against Jones from Jesse's parents. First tonight, our report on the incendiary radio host Alex Jones. So years later in 2017, Meghan Kelly was profiling Alex Jones on a show that she had on NBC. For years, Jones has been spreading conspiracy theories, claiming, for instance, that elements of the US government allowed the 9-11 attacks to happen, and that the horrific Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax. And Neil appeared on the show to provide the family's viewpoint of the lies that Jones had been spreading all of these years. I dropped him off in 904. That's when we dropped him off at school with his book bag. He told Meghan Kelly about his last moments with Jesse. Hours later, I was picking him up and a body bag. He had gone into the school in the wee hours of the morning on the night of the shooting, and he held Jesse's body. I lost my son. I buried my son. I held my son with a bullet hole through his head. This was obviously a pretty sacred memory to Neil, and he shared it with Meghan Kelly on the show that evening. And how did a defamation suit come out of that? What did Jones say? Alex Jones was unhappy with the way he was being portrayed in Meghan Kelly's broadcast that night. And after the broadcast aired, one of his sidekicks, a guy named Owen Schroyer, went on Infowars and said that Neil couldn't have held his son that night, because according to official reports, which of course, conspiracy theorists had picked through and parsed and cherry picked, the families, quote unquote, weren't allowed to see their children after their deaths. Jones later picked up on Owen Schroyer's false claims and amplified them. And that was the genesis of the defamation lawsuit that Neil and Jesse's mom, Scarlett, filed against Alex Jones. On the stand of trial, Jones was caught in several other lies as well. For example, he had earlier testified under oath that he had absolutely no texts on his phone about Sandy Hook. Neil and Scarlett's lawyer, Mark Bankston, knew different. As we learned in this moment that few lawyers will ever get in their entire career. Your order to turn over any text messages made between Sandy Hook. Right? Yes. And you didn't have it. Right? Not that we could find. Did you know that 12 days ago, 12 days ago, your attorney's messed up and sittin' in time. You sent me an entire digital copy of your entire cell phone with every text message you've sent for the past two years. Unless you've done it in discovery, you were asked, do you have Sandy Hook text messages on your phone and you said no. Correct. You said that under oath. I was mistaken. I was mistaken. I was mistaken. That's whatConsumer stupid saying he sees I got family members that are really smart in a lot of ways, but they're just real kind of quiet and have this way about them and and they they they move in their pace like they're fast in some ways and slow in others and he's I mean I think he has to ask like somebody on the spectrum. Okay, so he's on the spectrum. There's something wrong with this man. There's something wrong with Alex Jones. He went on to try to dismiss his many comments about Neil Scarlet the new town family says just what you know is all unintentional. It was unintentional watch. Never intentionally tried to hurt you. I never even said your name until this case came to court. I didn't even know it worked until a couple years ago when all this started up. The internet had a lot of questions. I had questions and over that six seven year period before I got sued or six year period, it's clear you can see the whole progression of us a few times we covered it trying to actually find out what happened. One day Scarlet took to this stand and when it appeared that she had finished with her testimony, they took a break. Only then did Alex Jones show up in the courthouse. This was an incredible moment because Scarlet was not done with her testimony and Scarlet and Neil and many of the new town families have long wanted the chance to address Alex Jones right to his face. Incredibly, Scarlet got that chance. She was poised and she was amazingly restrained. Having a six year old son shot in the forehead in his first grade classroom is unbearable. Unbearable. You don't think you're going to survive. But there are people that have and then to have someone on top of that perpetuate a lie, a lie that it was a hoax that didn't happen. It was a false flag that I'm an actress. When you get on and you say, oh sorry, but I know actresses when I see them. You think I'm an actress? No, you can't talk right now. Sorry. I did. I asked him a question. You can you get to testify right now. You're under oath. Nobody else in the room is. Scarlet was later seen offering Alex Jones a bottle of water for the cough that he had. Neil Haslin actually shook his hand. What a man. What a difference in character between these men. Believe it or not, I was almost at this trial. Neil and Scarlet's lawyer told me that they needed me to take the stand to get the NBC News interview into evidence. They wanted to play it for the jury. I will tell you the truth. I was not excited to do this and really wrestled with whether I could or should. This whole story, every iteration of it has been personally and professionally painful. Did I really want to leave my family, travel to Austin, Texas, take part in this insane trial with an out of control defendant and subject myself to a hostile cross examination, not to mention relive a difficult time in my career and a chapter of dealing with Alex Jones that, frankly, I would rather forget. No. The actual trial day that I was to be called the day I was going to be called as a witness happened to be scheduled for the same day of Thatcher, that third child of mine, his ninth birthday party, not his birthday, but his birthday party. And for the first time in my 12 years of motherhood, that would mean I'd be missing one of my children's birthdays, one of their birthday parties. I had never done that. Now, I was standing in the back, I've been a busy working mom. I knew that it would likely stir up a shitstorm of negative news stories from the left and would also not go over well with the right. Some of which has come to really embrace Alex Jones more recently. Some think of him as a martyr for having been de-platformed another event that happened shortly after our interview. But the bottom line was there was no world in which I was saying no to Neil and Scarlett. I'd be missing my son's birthday party. They have missed every birthday of their sons for 10 years. Thanks to this evil shooter who murdered 21st graders, including Jesse in 2012. I might get bad press. How about reading over and over again online that you faked your sweetheart's life and death and then having crazed lunatics threatened to kill you for it. This whole thing is insanity. These lies about Sandy Hook are insane. And by the way, Alex Jones has been telling lies like this about 9-11, about Oklahoma City, about so many things and innocent people we could spend all day talking about it. I agreed to go. I booked my flights, so did my lawyer, and then miraculously I didn't have to do it. Mark Bankston told us that the Info Wars team had screwed up and inadvertently their testimony had led to the entire NBC News tape being admitted into evidence. I was not needed and I was relieved. I was happy for Neil and Scarlett. And I was uncertain up to this very moment whether I should say anything at all publicly about it. There are some to this day who write to me asking me to apologize to Alex Jones for that interview. They think I sandbagged him because he released a partial tape of me pitching him the interview saying it would not be a hit piece. Partial tape. On the stand too, he and his team claim I somehow set him up making him renew his Sandy Hook claims that he really really didn't want to do but for the big bad mean Meghan Kelly making him. The truth is I told Alex Jones from the start that Sandy Hook would be part of this interview that we would go over the controversies but that I wanted to cover more about him than that and that's exactly what we did in the NBC News piece which is one of the journalistic endeavors of which I am most proud in my career. No one made him spew these conspiracy theories but himself. He jumped willingly and recklessly into those defamatory claims about the new town families which he now finally admits were false. He admitted it under oath at this trial. This judgment is morally correct and beyond past due. Alex Jones yes in his own way a talented compelling sometimes sometimes on other issues weirdly correct entertaining force he is in independent media has hurt too many people too many times. I am happy for Neil and Scarlet. I am relieved the jury punished Alex Jones and I hope anyone who sees this as a free speech issue goes back to look at the law and the history of this case. He is hurting people. He is not actually sorry though he claims to be now. This is not about free speech. It's about one man violating the law with impunity over and over and over again hopefully that ends now. We'll be right back with a newly elected GOP congresswoman from Texas who is already making waves as an alleged far right Latina according to the New York Times. We'll see about that. Stay tuned. New York City and Washington DC now experiencing a little taste of the border crisis as Texas Governor Greg Abbott buses migrants north. Oh the mayors of these northern cities they don't like it. They they're fine with an open border when it doesn't affect them. Governor Abbott says he's doing this because the president refuses to acknowledge the crisis created by his open border policies. New York's mayor is calling the governor's actions horrific saying some of the migrants are being forced onto the buses even if they want to go somewhere else. What is it like just a chauffeur service they get to just tell Governor Abbott's bus driver well you know I've got relatives in Salt Lake. What do you mean? Joining me now newly elected Texas congresswoman Myra Flores she's a Republican who was born in Mexico. She's young I think 36 congresswoman Flores do I have your age correct it's pretty amazing what you've done. Thank you so much thank you for having me and yes I'm 36 years old. Oh my gosh you're you're like a baby so I love it because not withstanding your youth you've created quite the firestorm in Washington and with the media who are not happy about a young Mexican born Latino woman winning as a Republican you're the first amazingly you're the first to ever do it you certainly aren't going to be the last but what do you make of the reaction to you? Honestly it doesn't surprise me I I saw it very early on but for me it's really not about politics I was raised and I was born and raised in in Borros de Malipas Mexico raised with strong conservative values to always put God and family first and I'm just not willing to put my my values aside for no political party and when I came here to the United States I was raised with those same values it didn't change because I moved here to the United States those values live in me they're within me and I'm proud of it and I want my children or children to grow with the same values and that's who we are here in South Texas I really don't know any different South Texas is very conservative we've always put God and family first we're all about hard work that is just who we are and that's why I felt very confident when I decided to run because I know my district I know my people better than anyone and I knew that if I focused on our values and the issues that really matter to the district that we would be successful now I want to get into more of your personal story and background in one second but let's just spend a moment on news of the day and how upset the DC mayor the New York mayor are that governor Abbott is shipping migrants who have crossed into the country illegally up to their towns you know I grew up in New York state I lived down in the Washington DC area for a few years they don't normally have to deal with this in the way that Texans do Arizonans do and so on so what do you make of their complaints that this is just this is inhumane and it's horrible well I thought they were supportive of immigrants I thought that they love immigrants that they want immigrants here in the United States that's what they've been saying all this time and all of a sudden they don't want them in New York as they don't want them in their cities it just blows my mind because they were okay with what's happening here in South Texas because I call it a humanitarian crisis I really do it's the Biden administration's policies that encourage illegal immigration knowing the serious journey dangerous journey that they will have to go through to come here to the United States they don't care about that we do care we care about the immigrants we care about their safety we care about the American people that is why we advocate for legal immigration so the good people can come here to United States where it's safer where they don't have to go through such dangerous journey that's why I will always encourage people to do it the right way I do understand that the legal process needs to be improved but it doesn't surprise me Megan it doesn't surprise me that they react this way because they have been treated me the same way they claim that they work for immigrants and it doesn't matter to them that I came here legally they still treat me just the same so many of them have called me racist names calling me Miss Biholes Miss and Chiladas Tacos so many of them have told me to go back to Mexico why because they want us to come here to the United States and obey them they don't want us to come here to United States and embrace our values embrace who we are so it really doesn't surprise me that they they feel this way but there are a bunch of hypocrites and if they are for what's happening in south Texas which were not then they should take it live with it live with it live with it and then you can have an opinion it's not it's not somebody else's problem their messaging has changed a lot um and I say this as somebody again who lives in the general region of New York it's like fine we should have to deal with it I mean from all my years on Fox News we used to cover the actual problems caused by people crossing into the country illegally to the border communities and most of the people on the left pay absolutely no attention to this and many haven't even heard one story about it so if they have to be forced to live it to understand how dangerous it is and how problematic it is then I support Governor Abbott in this tactic let's talk about the attacks on you they've been disgusting when you say those terms you're not just making them up the as I understand it you are supposed to face um Vincente Gonzalez um in November right to hold on to this seat that you won in a special election and this is a democrat he's represented Texas uh Texas 15 this district since 2017 there's been some redistricting which we can talk about in a second but anyway the point is uh he's your opponent he's a democrat and it turns out this this political blogger who was paid to run ads for Gonzalez's campaign launched a series of racist attacks against you calling you as you point out miss freeholes miss enchiladas and then questioned uh he claims that you worked in cotton fields with your Mexican immigrant parents as a child calling you a cotton pick and liar um he he basically has stood by this and said um it was political satire this is mckayle the guy who did it not not Gonzalez and questioned when did for hollis become the equivalent of the n-word I'm going to be merciless with her I'm a liberal democrat it's a war against the republican and I will continue to be merciless what do you make of it and he paid him to do those things and no apology no apology and those insults weren't just towards me they were towards an entire culture the insults towards also uh the sexual uh harassment that I've received wasn't just an attack against me was an attack against all women but I saw I saw it very early on we said that Gonzalez did state that he was more qualified because he was born in Texas and I was born in Mexico and I never thought that a democrat would say that but again I knew exactly that this would be coming but I just didn't never thought that it was going to be about my legal status I mean they were doing an investigation on how I got here to the United States they were doing an investigation on my father how he got here to the United States they don't care about all the millions of people that are coming in into the United States illegally but let's investigate mighta florida and how she got here and how her parents got here I was blessed but I came here to the United States legally I was I was blessed that my father became an American citizen and I do understand that not so many other people have that same blessing and that's the reason why I am focused on improving the legal process so more little girls like Myra more more children have the same experience like me I understand that I I would say I'm blessed that I was able to come here legally and I want that for other children as well for other people I don't want them to go through that dangerous journey illegal immigration does fund criminal organizations I'm from Tamalipas I I know exactly what's happening here in the southern borders and the criminal organizations have taken over the border you cannot cross unless you pay them thousands and thousands of dollars women are being abused children are being abused we have a real problem here in the United States with child sex trafficking and if we want to put an end to that we must secure our borders and focus on legal immigration yeah yeah well I mean more and more the Democrats are being forced to pay attention to this because they see how important it is in the polls but I will say Gonzalez said in a statement of the Washington Post his team quote advertises on many platforms and they have no control over the editorial content quote we do not pay for political attacks and we will not be advertising on this platform again adding that he condemned the offensive remarks on the platform just as he condemned Trump's racist rants about Mexico so as you know the the dodge right like the the equivocation it's not all at all on clear to me that Gonzalez disliked what mikael said about you notwithstanding what he's now saying but what's likely to happen because my understanding is you in here facing off but redistricting gives him the advantage now because they basically redrawn the congressional lines in Texas in a way where this district which you won will now be very favorable to the Democrat hence political is dubbing the race likely Democratic the Cook political report now has it as lean Democratic again because of redistricting so what do you think that's true well it got harder for Vicente when he initially decided to run for Texas district 34 he thought he had it in his pocket he never thought that we would win a special election and that he would have to run against congresswoman miteff lotus i am being combat and texas 34 no matter the lines we are very conservative conservative by nature that is just who we are it doesn't change that we did win Cameron County Cameron County is the biggest county with the biggest population in the special election for the first time ever in history and look if i was able to flip a district that had not been for over 150 years i feel very confident in winning our reelection in November but because i don't take no one for granted i really don't i'm working very hard every single day i could god first and of course the amazing team that is behind me that i'm confident that it's going to get me through in my amazing family as well and i just i just know we we have it but i take nothing for granted yeah you've done the impossible before now speaking exactly speaking with the attacks against you the New York Times i mentioned it in the intro they called you a far far right latina okay far right latina you and two other um latina republicans um far right okay why i okay let's we'll find out um and then cnn says you may be latina but you're not the real deal you're not a real deal latino and this is why they say that this is an op-ed by paul reyas on july 12th which says um you hold conservative positions on abortion gun control and immigration but quote that's just not where most latinos are these days the pew research center reports 60 percent of hispanic adults say abortion should be legal in all or most cases the june quinipiac university survey found 58 percent of hispanics want stricter gun control laws pew notes that an overwhelming majority of latinos favor major fixes in the us immigration system so what do you say to paul reyas who says you're not the real deal latina latino because 60 percent of the of hispanics feel differently than you do on those issues i strongly disagree i mean i really don't care to be honest with you what these people think because they know nothing about me they know nothing about our culture i mean i was just i was born in mechico you know i mean what not the end of you want like it's it blows my mind not really not that i guess it's not really not right um but i know my people i know my district i mean i work as a respiratory care practitioner for four seven years work with pediatric work work with the elderly community i have a strong bond in relationship with my district and we are pro-family pro-life and it's all i really don't i go based on what i see every single day i don't go too much on what the paul say i it has to match and it's just not what i see and i don't know i'm just really confident in the people that i represent and i know that here in texas 34 i don't know throughout the country but i know here in texas 34 we put god first in family that is just who we are and the issues that matter to the district right now is the economy border security and family values those are the top issues you know that matter to my district and i'm gonna focus on that i all the other numbers uh you have no control of but i do know my district and we know we know the numbers are changing they're changing with Hispanics and voters in the way they see the republican party that's been reflected in election after election starting with joe iden's when where their support was slipping away in a in a way that alarmed a lot of democrats and continues to um okay let's talk for a minute about the far right claim this is in part i believe political because they would just be labeling any republican latina far right it's just that you have to be dismissed in some way so you know make you less appealing to sort of center leftists who are eyeballing you um but there i understand the the one piece of it which is you i know you've talked about this but you have um cited or added hashtag q and hashtag q and on to social media posts along with something was that was new to me wwg one wga which is shorthand for where we go one we go all a q and on slogan so i've heard you say that you were on fox news and you know you didn't you said you're against q and then it was just a hashtag and your post was actually against q and on so can i ask you officially like because it doesn't look like it's against q in fairness you have hashtag q hashtag q and on and you have hashtag magga hashtag donald trump hashtag build the wall hashtag we are the people so like it's a bunch of positive things that you like and q and q and on is in there so was it really some an attempt to condemn q no it was it to be honest with you the hashtags are also for more audience right to reach more people the post obviously it's not in favor of none of that i've always said that i am against that if and moving you know focus on the issues that matter to my district i've always said it over and over it but i'm against all that no idea to be honest with you what goes and entails all that but hashtag is just used to get more people to see your post which was um a positive uh post it was not again it's not for for any of what you're of what you're saying so i've never been in favor of it don't care for it don't care for the far left just as much as i don't care about the far right it's just not who we are to be honest with you you know and i don't mean uh no disrupt but that is just not who we are as the Hispanic community we're conservative um we're a lot more moderate um and i just so glad that i represent a district where we don't have in neither or we don't have people in my in texas 34 that are far left we don't have people in my district that are far right that is just not who we are and i really think that as Americans we are more in the middle it's just the media has been dividing us and telling us that we can have real conversations when at the end of the day where all Americans doesn't matter if you're a democrat or republican as a respiratory care practitioner i cared for patients regardless of their political affiliation i didn't care you know whether a political affiliation was um so anything with q gets people out i mean the original q is that the democrats are running a sex pet a child petafile ring out of a out of a uh a pizza joint in washington i mean for the record do you believe that no absolutely not most people haven't even heard of it you know i feel like no i've never even heard of it you know uh but what i did learn um about all this is that i have to be careful like what type of you know hashtags we use even though yes we want more to see them more than anyone you more than anyone just ask any black conservative right it's like any member of a minority group that winds up declaring themselves conservatives or republican will be targeted in the most vicious unsparing manner it's not right but it's true so it's one of the things that makes you sympathetic to me you know i i can see they're gonna put you under the microscope in a way that others won't be put but you do have to be careful extra careful i had to be careful absolutely it's a it's a living it's an experience and you know every day you learn and you become better and you become wiser and for sure i i'm a lot more careful moving forward and using those type of hashtags now let me let me ask you this because um we now we now have a situation as i mentioned where Hispanics are drafting over to the republican party more and more and more and i think the democrats the more i listen to them the more they keep trying to sort of tell Hispanics that they too should be on board with the causes of black lives matter and identity and you know that they can sort of get ahead in the identity lane in a way that the democrats want to foster that republicans don't and more and more i see Hispanics in the poll saying we don't want that we we think about these things differently than you so why is that we believe all lives matter um i honestly hate identity politics um but i i do think that the democrats party has been taking advantage of uh of us using identity politics and i believe that we're going to end identity politics by encouraging more Hispanics and you know african-americans to join the republican party and have equal you know have some balance on both parties we need representation equal representation on both parties because even amongst us Hispanics we we don't all think alike i mean even those of us in the republican party we we do not all think exactly the same we're going to have some differences as well and that's okay but i do think that the only way to end identity politics is by um having equal representation on both parties it's so nice to talk to you i cannot wait to see what happens in november i will say win or lose thank you i hope you're not done i hope you stay in national politics i will never yes i will never be done i want the best of for for my country i want the best for the Hispanic community and i will always be a voice for them no matter what uh racan great to have you thank you so much and all the best thank you so much god bless you oh you too all right and we're going to be right back speaking of of uh black conservatives who have gotten it unfairly the florida surgeon general who's been on the show once before in fact i was here in the serious studios last time we had him on and here i am again for the day as well it's like i only interview him while i'm here in the serious studios and we shall do it again in one moment uh he's drawing the ire of the left again including the media and we'll talk

Joining us now is florida surgeon general dr joseph lata pau he is the author of the new book out later this month called transcend fear a blueprint for mindful leadership in public health yes we need that welcome back to the show dr lata pau great to have you here thanks so much magan we do thank you for putting it down in paper on paper and letting everybody read your thoughts because you're one of the few people who actually showed some some reserve some sanity some considered judgment when everyone around you was panicking so we need somebody like you to stop and say here's how i did that and here's what's in my background that led me to be kind of familiar with trauma and to not completely freak out whenever it hits and so on and so forth so i thought i was very insightful and personal and needed thank you for doing it. Thanks Megan and that was the point you nailed it. Ah alright so we'll get to the book in one sec but let's just talk about a couple of news headlines since you are a doc doc and you know what you're talking about so right now what's in the news scaring everybody is monkey pox and i have a confession to make to you i i haven't have been paying very close attention to monkey pox because i can feel the media trying to make me panic about monkey pox which makes me say i refuse i refuse i will wait until there's need to panic but my governor up until recently i moved to Connecticut but for most of my life i lived in New York Kathy Hochl who's just awful she's declared a state of emergency over monkey pox now um do you agree with that decision? Well i mean i think in general obvious states of emergencies should be used when there is an emergency and so in general i mean no and obviously i don't know all of the the factors that she was considering and making that decision but um you know i think we just it's this uh the pattern of reaching for the panic button when we're faced with problems is you know that's just it's not it it it um it leads to normalization of ways of sort of you know ways of running in a society governing a society that are harmful for individuals and for you know important things like individual rights and liberty so in general you know emergencies really should be safe for that in my in my opinion yeah in the opinion of your boss because governor de santis came out and said i am so sick of politicians and we saw this with covid trying to sow fear in the population we're not doing fear he said and he came out and said um to criticize her move and said they they're going to abuse these emergency powers to restrict your freedom i guarantee you that's what will happen and you know we have seen that through covid as these governors get drunk on their own power and then decide they'd like to hold these emergency powers over us forever it's sort of the old camel's nose under the tent you know once the nose is under the camel's coming so they say oh emergency power is from monkeypox and before we know it schools are closed and our kids are doing at home learning for a year you know that's we've that's how it goes and i wish i could laugh and say oh you know it's really funny but you are exactly right you know and and it's easier to you know to kind of imagine it's absurd but look at all the absurd stuff we've seen you know over the last two years firing healthy nurses you know who've had covid and you know trying to make like three-year-olds who you know i mean you're lucky if you get them in their clothes and out the door in time for school you're trying to make them like and keep and have them keep those clothes on between the door on the car and try to make them put like you know silly stupid mask on their face and it just just there's it's there's been so much of sturdy so it's no i think it's a very realistic assessment on the subject of school insanity we're seeing school districts like the washington dc school district mandate the vaccines for 12 and up or they can't come back to school l.a. as well had that but they've put it on hold for now since they're missing some 10 to 20 thousand students from their roles who just bailed last year when they canceled school all the time and now they realize they're in the middle of a crisis that they created um seen school district in louisiana make mandates on the vaccines and here's my question to you if you haven't gotten your kid the vaccine yet and you're being told he can't enroll um this year unless he gets it is there any point of that given that they're now working on new vaccines to combat omicron so it's an admission that the current vaccines are really not that effective against omicron so why would i stick my kid with a vaccine that was for a version of this virus that is now a couple of versions old only to be told probably in six months i have to have him stuck again with the new one they're coming up with that actually addresses the current variant of of this virus that we're dealing with but you know no megan the whole thing's confused and you know fortunately in terms of the you know the new toddler governor the san justice likes to call him with toddler vaccines and i'm sorry i enjoy that he calls it that um in terms of those i mean fortunately parents are just you know they're just almost all saying no thanks so i it gives me some um some faith and um and some confidence that some sanity is being restored in terms of parents like listening to their intuition obviously the fact that very few of them under the five-year-old group have said no thanks while dr falci and you know dr wolensky and everyone else at the federal level is saying you should you have to do this you've got to do this it gives me some um more faith and parental intuition and i think you know i saw i was pleased to see that l a back down and i'm glad that um that you know some parents decided not to fold and i think that i think it's going to be a tricky battle because the the issue is beyond you know which variant is being targeted or whatever you know the bottom line is just before any other issues right before you asked about waning immunity before you look at well you know how safe are these in children um before any of those other questions there's just just that basic question of you know is this something that my kid is going to be better off receiving and the fact is and it is a fact that a benefit in healthy children or children who've had covid and therefore have immunity has like never been demonstrated so you know so in other words why are we even talking about this you know why is this even something that they're putting on the plate right here so can i tell you this is what they said in our school they said and by the way just got the stats less than three percent of children under the age of five have been vaccinated so yes 97 percent of parents nationwide have said uh no thanks but no thanks and only 31 percent of children between the ages of five and 11 have been vaccinated despite mandates and so on you know the vast majority of parents there too have said no we're not doing that but here's what they say in our school to mandate because we have a school that's mandated the vaccine for 16 and up and so far they haven't moved that down the reason they didn't go lower than 16 was because it was only the emergency use authorization at least when we went into summer and i'm very much hoping they won't change that even though now technically they've gotten beyond that in the approvals anyway they're rationales as follows when you when you get covid if you've had the vaccine you have a lower viral load in your nose oh thanks okay that's what they say is that true at all um i mean my answer is that i haven't seen a study that shows that but my other like the more relevant question is like this is ludicrous that's that is the relevant response like i mean okay i let's suppose that's true you know it's like you know it was at an end point in the trials you know i mean that's doctors care about and public health is about you know making helping people be as healthy as possible when you i mean i don't know it's almost i don't know whether to put people like that in a box and like just a lock up that you know lock it and then let them out in a couple days and ask them again if they still want to do that it's crazy talk because they'll say and this by the way is an all-boy school so they're dealing with the population especially at those older ages that actually does have to worry about myocarditis and you know a real risk from the vaccine that's been documented so you ask them on the other side well okay okay even if you do have an increased viral load if you haven't gotten the vaccine in your nose what does that do that that potentially makes you more of a spreader but getting covid is sort of a foregone conclusion at this point just ask Joe Biden just ask Anthony Fauci the question is how can we save lives and this is not a group that's at risk of dying from covid or even of getting really really ill so then you say what about myocarditis that is a risk for these kids yes you can get it if you get covid but you can also get it from the vaccine and the vaccine is not something you have to do the vaccine is not something that necessarily is just going to come your way from living your life like covid is at this point they don't care they they want everyone to be shot with that vaccine i don't know why i they just they ignore the myocarditis and they say you can't say that you have like a history of blood clots in your family you can have any sort of problems in your they don't count any that the only thing they'll allow you to get out of it for is if you had a negative reaction tooth shot one you have to get one jab and only then if you have a doctor they approve of say little johnny had you know whatever hives only then can you get out of shot two i mean while they're telling the doctors that hey we're gonna scrutinize any any vaccine exemption that you do no it's it's it's ludicrous and i mean i i just i know that it's can be really difficult um less difficult now than it was in the middle of all the craziness that we all had to deal with but i just i encourage people to you know to to to to just not participate to really do their very best not to participate you know i mean i know it's difficult um you know in california you know some of my colleagues when they were faced with the vaccine mandate you know they bit the bullet and um and they if they didn't believe in it there weren't many most of my colleagues did believe in it but um you know i had a few that you know one guy's not working there anymore another guy was going to retire but they you know they approved his religious exemption and you know my wife and i you know we were we um you know when we had to move to florida if like the crazies had gotten their way and instituted vaccine mandates were fine we had had driven florida you know um so i just it's just it i know that i know i know it's not easy and i know it's way beyond not easy but you know it's only it is it is courage that changes the world and um and with every person that makes that step it makes it a little bit easier for the next person and courage always rules the day that would definitely i mean if enough parents say take a hike to the um administrators at any school that policy is done yes well hopefully parents are starting to feel that more and more now that we see you know the vaccines are not what they were billed to be um one other thing on florida there's been quite a bit of news this weekend as the florida board of medicine voted this past friday to start the process of setting rules for treating transgender minors this is a debate that has come up state after state after state you know places like florida us like uh texas have said we're going to close down these transgender quote care clinics they're nothing of the sort we shouldn't be giving cross sex hormones and so on to young teens or we should at least severely restrict it more and more red states are saying that so now florida is going to take a hard look at this issue and where do you stand on it yeah i was i you know i attended that board meeting so i heard some of the discussion and i contributed a little bit to it you know it's interesting megan if we had had this conversation six months ago i wouldn't have been able to say the things i would say now and i wouldn't have known what to say and um you know what i've what i've done is i've reviewed every study every published study that has been um cited by both proponents and opponents of um of these you know the hormonal treatments and the the sex change in surgeries you know the mastectomy is the um uh and this you know sex reduction in surgeries and yeah and i've honestly like i i had to you know i almost had to kind of wire my my jaw shut shut it is um it truly megan is appalling um how much um how far physicians in this area have gone um compared to how much we know how certain we are about the evidence and um essentially you know the studies these people you know the advocates like to say that the surgeries you know either reduce like improvement to health or you know you know whatever they have some benefits like these therapies and you look at these studies megan and um not a single one is is a um like a prospective study with good control groups there's not a single randomized clinical trial all of the evidence basically that they make their arguments on are um what we call observational studies and they are vulnerable to like profound confounding so essentially there is no high quality evidence that is shown a benefit and despite all the procedures and all the hormones administered there's not a single high quality study that shows a benefit on the other side there's tremendous risk with these therapies and you know why is there a risk the risk is pretty obvious i mean with the hormone blockers that's a the puber the pubero period is you know that's an extremely um complex period where hormones are changing and they are active in development including brain development so you know we don't know what we're doing at all in terms of you know in terms of long-term effects or short-term effects of doing of manipulating this these um hormones that are critical to development during puberty that's astonishing and then you know obviously with the sex um sex reassignment surgeries they're clear risk of sterility and infertility so when you look at the fact that the benefits haven't been proven and there's been opportunity this could have been prospectively studied you know randomized clinical trials have been done the benefits have not been shown i mean they are absolutely not convinced me anyone who says they are is you know is sort of on a crusade and the risks are just obvious these procedures and these therapies fall into a quadrant in medicine that we avoid as standard of care i mean they we clearly avoid this you know they're just basically unproven benefit high risk i mean that's not how medical care works and then you add on top of that you're doing this to kids right that's the focus that's where we focused in florida like they can't provide consent you know they can't provide you know they're there there's a technical term called assent and in medical they to think that there is informed that the individual has the capacity when they're minor to make such a you know such a monumental treatment decision that's that's just ridiculous like you know so you know for multiple reasons i mean this it falls outside the standard of care they're upset because people are noticing and they're asking questions and they don't have good answers and i hope and i'm i'm confident that the florida board of medicine will rule in a way that is appropriate good good they would be one of the outliers sadly it's just more and more protests happen when you cut off ubiquitous access to this kind of care and as you point out when it's a minor nine times at a ten you have somebody else doing some agenda pushing on the person and their yes is not a legal yes they can't consent but we we choose to ignore that want to remind our audience you were the associate professor of medicine at ucla from 2016 to 2021 before being recruited by governor desantis to go on over to florida and be the the surgeon general of florida prior to that got your bachelor of arts in chemistry from wake forest university then move down to get your md from harvard medical school phd and health policy from harvard is will all the fancy degrees it's very hard for them to dismiss you you did you checked all the box the boxes they wanted you to check and then you started to sound like a conservative and now they hate you no either funny but other and they take that degree back if they could but yeah no i mean it's you know it's it's a lot of a lot of craziness out there but we will um you know that's that's my favorite part of the job is um is you know being a voice of sanity of sanity in a field of insanity yes well and you found the right partner in governor desantis so you write this book transcend fear a blueprint for mindful leadership and public health and i was surprised at your backstory and how forthcoming you were about it and how much time you spent on the abuse that you suffered and i think you must have felt this was very important to your personal story and sort of how you got to where you are you tell me why why was that in there was it hard to reveal so much about your personal background yeah thanks for that question i guess well i mean i honestly my god i love people and i really want everyone to um you know have the best chance that they can to um you know to to live a life that they want to live in a life that um you know that they find fulfilling and um and you know and i i can't be honest about me without sharing those things um because sort of me being here is not is not an accident um ironically um you know had you know had that um you know the babysitter not abused me not sexually abused me in the way that she did um i you know i wouldn't have developed the um sort of the numbness that i carried around in my life and thought didn't think anything of it because i thought that's how you know that it was normal and i wouldn't have um you know i wouldn't have had such a sort of a volatile um sort of crisis kind of an emotional physical emotional spiritual crisis when i fell in love with my wife and had i not had a lot i would not have um you know essentially been forced to um force to you know face it and and get help and my my wife is the one who she's guided me the whole way and um and not all that happened i would have been able to you know essentially to transcend my own fear to to shed the um the the things that i was holding on to in my own life that were um that were preventing me from you know from being free of fear being able to connect to other people being um able to be authentic to be who i you know to find who i am and to be who i am and to be you know the reflection of god that um that all of us are um though we all manage you know in this world to you know to collect all this stuff that is this buffer between um between who we are and and how we end up you know showing up in the world so um you know without those things i wouldn't be where i am i wouldn't be able to do the things that um that i've done i certainly wouldn't have been able to sort of withstand and sort of sail through the criticisms that that i've received without like changing something about myself or whatever or you know dealing with tremendous doubt losing my way losing my clarity so you know all of those things you know i fortunately gone on a path thanks to my wife that led me there and i think that's the most important thing is is you know to share that with folks so that people who are also interested in getting free of their own fears and um i'm fears of the most central one of all the things that that tend to you know confine us as humans and look look what you did i mean i listed some of your resume items it's like talk about overcoming fear and trauma you've clearly done that i mean you you don't get those credentials without doing that but you were open about the fact that you were wrestling and you were struggling and it wasn't like oh i'm perfect you know i became an adult and i've got it all together briana your wife critical role and i love the part about how when you fell in love this actually happened for my husband and me in a way too where we were dating long distance when we first got together and it's so you're kind of forced to fall in love with the person's mind or not at all right it's not like a physical thing all the time and for you in your case that was actually very important yeah absolutely megging yeah yes when when um it just so happened me and you know the thing about different types of traumatic experiences as you know is that they affect everyone differently you know so you don't know how um how they'll affect anyone and for me when um when that babysitter broke my boundaries you know it it affected me in a way that not only sort of numbed me to um to just kind of emotions and experiences but it also it also um it kind of introduced all the sexual trauma where i basically couldn't handle and i say handle i mean actually take in so couldn't handle the you know sort of the the energy of of anything sexual and i didn't know right so you know how did that show up for me well i was in relationships i wasn't emotionally connected you know i wasn't really sexually connected even if i were sexually active there wasn't any there wasn't any there was no um it was really no humanity in it no me in it because me was um all of me in fact was sort of shelled off so you know you fall in love and um and and fortunately and and you know having a long distance relationship having the phone conversations with my wife and fall in love unknowingly over the phone um move that out of of the equation and so i couldn't introduce that whole you know screwed up part of myself into the relationship and um and you know that let her kind of come in through the back door of my heart that's amazing and when she got there she saw how fucked up you were and she did not flee she didn't flee she she stuck it out she said i'm in long haul you have three kids together and ultimately she introduced you to somebody who would help you really get things under control and change your life tell us who that was and sort of the new techniques that came into your life um as a result of well chris from our and and sort of what you learned at that point forward yeah so yeah that's that's exactly right um so you know so she didn't flee him unfortunately oh man and for a wife i mean i i feel terrible i could apologize from now until at the i leave this room i wouldn't be able to use but you know fortunately she knew that you know underneath all that um all that crap there was a you know really good man and um and so you know the the she finally maybe we tried lots of things and everything helped a little bit but you know i was i was really effed up yeah and finally she got me to chris from here and chris fur is a he's a navy seal he's an ex navy seal and that's had his own journey and um and basically out of this journey he um he has developed you know a like a number of like techniques that he uses to help individuals get free of their their traumas and it's a stuff that every single person on this earth accumulates as they um as they live on the surf and um you know it's a combination i really don't understand it but i'll you know share it i'm sharing not a son who understands it but rather someone who went through it and and emerged from it um as as a combination of like it's a lot of stuff that's based on like chinese um medicine and meridian theory and like chi and the flow of chi and it involves like different techniques like um one of them's is then called mauching that where you basically um stress and trauma are released through the thighs and it's because i think it's because there's a meridian that um it's like one of the more one of the more um sort of fuller meridians or one of the more powerful ones in terms of its access to you know like mind, body, spirit, emotions and you know that's one of the techniques he uses he uses another technique called body of light that i mean it's it's uh it's it's someone who went to medical school it's nothing that you're reading books but i can tell you that it works in terms of like releasing trauma and then he's developed a number of um of expert there he calls them bestercises but there are some exercises stretches that um that are that help um process like the daily stress that we build up and you know i do those every day um and um and yeah i'll tell you that it's the closest thing to a miracle that i've ever experienced i worked with him for five days and that's like sort of standard thing that he does he's helped thousands of people actually and um you know i i was i mean i honestly i was complaining before before we started it because my wife you know she came home one day and she was like and i my poor wife i mean i i really i honest to god now that i look at myself and what i was doing and all part of my language about the shit that was coming out and i was just doing it all on her which is how many people live their lives their shit comes up and they just like spew it out into the field and anyway one day she came um it was like October 2019 and she's like honey i think i found someone for you i think i found the right person for you you know the sky he helps people who've had traumas and and i was like i was like all right she don't make the price i was like oh man and i look for i found trying to find every way to like get out of it to you know and i talked to Christopher and i was before we met and i was i was trying every single way you know but but i will tell you after just the first day um because i woke up and something i already changed that was very meaningful it was my ability to emotionally connect with other people and after the first day like it was already worth it and i told him and he laughed about it when i came in for the second day but i would tell you that like i would give every penny every penny with not a drop of hesitation to in exchange for what i've gotten from working with him wow all right now i'm i've got to know what you do with your thighs to make trauma easier to deal wait stand by though that's a great tease so let me pause you there i'll squeeze in a quick break and we'll come back uh with that with that nugget before we get on to code policy and how all these life lessons helped you there and the sort of your takeaways and i what do i need to do to my thighs to be a better manager of my stress what's what happens there well i you know i will do the best i can't consider and i'm just i'm a beneficiary but i'm not a practitioner but um you know basically um my understanding is that you know again one of the most powerful ingredients apparently it runs through your you know through your thighs and your legs and it um it has access it's sort of like when this this meridian has access to um aspects of your of your of your physical being your mental being your emotional being your spiritual being more so than any other meridian so so i think christopher often will work with people on this meridian early on and the work just i think because the benefit is is um is is is high for the input and so i'm you lay down i'm laying down on the ground so i'm you know i don't know yeah i can't i don't have eyes behind my head but i'm you lay down he has your laying down ground and basically i don't know exactly how he does it but he he basically i think it translates into horse stomping and he kind of walks up and down your thighs the back of your eyes and your legs at least then that's what it feels like and he's up you know he's overused so wait so he's on your hamstrings or he's on your quads oh on the hamstrings so yeah you're so you're face down okay okay got it i mean i came along and and he's he's very gifted so i'm you know he's he's like not like if i were going in i don't know what i would feel to help anyone at all i do not try this at home yeah i yeah but um basically what the experience feels like is um i'll share i'll share it all with you so he so it um it feels like like initially you know on a scale of one to ten i mean some places and i think he knows just sort of exactly where to to put pressure i mean it feels like a like a nine or a ten or ten pain pain yes yes and i mean it it echoes and eventually it'll it'll come down a little bit a little bit and eventually you know feel like at least for me it basically felt like a five or you know maybe even a four where it was like it wasn't even hurting really, you know, and this is a very good thing because it means that you're having more flow, sort of more cheetahs flowing through that ridian. And so there's that. And so I'll share a little bit more. I don't write about this in the book, but I'll share a little bit more. So we did it, and he does a number of different things, but that particular thing, we probably did two or three separate times. And maybe the last time or the penultimate time, we did it. At the end of it, by this time, it felt pleasurable. Like it was, instead of being pain, it felt good. And as crazy as it sounds, Megan, I actually felt like a tiger. And I know it sounds nuts, but I felt like an animal, like I was connected with an animal. And in Christopher, I told him, because that's what it felt like. And he shared with me that it was my spirit animal. And one of the times when he finished it, when he finished doing it, I felt I felt frozen. I felt incredibly cold just in my chest. And I was shivering. Christopher laid me down and told me to lay down a couch. He put some blankets over me. And so I was shivering. I was freezing. We're indoors freezing and shaking and shivering. And just here, just in my chest. And Christopher explained to me that that was the fright from my experience when I was three or four years old, nothing away. And I laid on that couch and shivered for maybe 40 minutes or so that I was freezing. And then it went away. So it's like, like I said, I never have had anything like it before. But I know from my own experience that there is far more to our bodies and our beings than we learn in medical school. And we learned at Harvard. Wow. So all of that in the rear view, how did it change you as a man, as a doctor, as a public health official? Yeah. So Christopher, he wrote a book about his own experiences, Christopher Mayer, and he calls it free for life. And that's actually what his goal, that's like, that's what his purposes when he works with people to help them get free for life. And that was the result. Does it mean that everything is perfect? No, it's not really so much that. And I still work with stuff. There's different new things, right? Not the same things. I like have challenges now that are different, obviously, than what I had before I worked with them. But they're also more involved challenges. And they're more honest challenges in their lesson message, because there's less of my own past trauma in the room with me. There's less sharing that I'm carrying around. There's less of my own, honestly, bullshit, right? That's how most of many of us, like all of us really are on shame, carrying different amounts of this in terms of what we believe about ourselves and the world, and what we're entitled to, and how things should be, and all that stuff. So there's less of that stuff. So I still have challenges, but there's nothing like the challenges I had before. And for me, and for almost, I think everyone who works with him, who wants to actually get better, it's free. So for me, one of the things that was a constant part of my life was fear. I was fearful of everything. And you're looking me on the outside, you wouldn't know. But that's because I had really good self-control in terms of blocking, and frankly, part of the way that happens is I had a lot of disconnection. I wasn't very well. I wasn't connected to my insides. So it was easier to kind of block off whatever it was that we keep it from showing externally, because I was less connected. And the fear that I was just a constant, permeating part of my life was gone. A lot of other junk was gone too. And it was like just kind of having almost like a clean plate or something. I feel like listening to you, this allowed you to start making decisions intellectually, and not necessarily emotionally, driven by demons, by past trauma. If any of that can get removed in any large portion, not entirely, of course, we are human. It can be freeing. So the name of the book means more to me now, Transcend Fear Transcend Fear. By the way, I do want people to know, it's not out yet. It's available everywhere on August 23rd. But you can pre-order it right now on Amazon, which helps out the good doctor. The pre-orders help it come out ideally at number one, which the New York Times will try to stop it from being. But together, we could help overcome that if we pre-order it in great enough numbers, Transcend Fear Transcend the New York Times blocking system on conservatives, and Transcend all of that nonsense. I love this. I love that you've done this. This is a gift to us all. Thank you for telling your story. Meghan, let me just add something really brief. I actually want to say that if anything, it's actually, it lets me make decisions from who I am. And that's everything, right? So brain, heart, spirit. And if anything, I actually use my other stuff more now than I can use this. I mean, this is interesting. Oh, and I use it. But like the world happens, you know, the world heart happens here, the world happens here in terms of heart and gut and all that. So it's access to all of that animal work to make decisions. So more emotion, but less damage, less negative influence, but still a lot of heart. Lots of heart. Because that's where we are. I mean, that's how babies come out. That's who we are. It's the other stuff we add on over the years. And be get over here and walk on my hamstrings right now. She's ready. And she's coming. Doc, so much love. Thank you so much. And our love to be a beautiful wife, Brianna too. Thanks, baby. Hope to talk again soon. Don't forget, transcend fear ordered now on Amazon. Thanks for listening to the Meghan and Kelly show, no BS, no agenda, and no fear."
