    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show podcast. Welcome back in our number two holiday edition president's day. I hope all of you are having a fantastic start to your weeks, especially if you got to use this day as a vacation day. We are down in Palm Beach tomorrow. We will be live from Maro Lago with president Trump right off the top of the show. And I guarantee you one of the things that we're going to be talking about him with is everything going on in Canada right now. And Buck throughout the entirety of the weekend, the amount of force brought to bear on truly peaceful protesters who were actually not creating any substantial threat to anyone was off the charts. And there's a couple of things that to me are terribly frustrating and also create a great deal of fear going forward. And that is, first of all, they have seized so many different bank accounts, millions of dollars in bank accounts based on people donating to the Canadian trucker protest. This is an unprecedented overreach of power that has been embarked upon by Trudeau under his emergency powers acts that he undertook. And the second part of this is Trudeau had two options to me, Buck, really two options here at its essence. He could do what a lot of democratic governors have done. Look at the data coming out on COVID and make a decision to eliminate masks and vaccine mandates and claim victory, even though many of us out there who have been watching this data know that it didn't actually occur that all of these restrictions led to COVID disappearing. Okay, so that in and of itself was one option. And that's the option that honestly is kind of a rational option, even if you don't want to admit you were wrong. He chose the other option rather than relent and start to dial back all sorts of issues in Canada. And by the way, United Kingdom, Boris Johnson is coming out in the near future here and effectively announcing all COVID restrictions are over, even though, by the way, 95 year old queen who we, of course, wish well is evidently doing fine with COVID in in England right now handling light duty. Yes, still actually working even while she has COVID. And the other option he had, so he could have been rational. The other option was crush this protest like a totalitarian dictator. And he took the second option here. And he's even now, I believe we have audio of this book, even now he's not saying it's over. They're going to treat these protesters like it's January 6th and follow them to the ends of the earth. Listen to this. As I said, the Emergencies Act is not something to undertake lightly. And it's something that needs to be momentary, temporary, and proportional. That's why every single day I'm receiving briefings and we are reflecting on how much longer the Emergencies Act needs to be in place. We don't want to keep it in place a single day longer than necessary. But even though the blockades are lifted across border openings right now, even though things seem to be resolving very well in Ottawa, this state of emergency is not over. There continues to be real concerns about the coming days. But we will continue to evaluate every single day whether or not it is time and we are able to lift this state of emergency. He is the absolute worst to start with that. I mean, I think you could make a very strong case that he's the worst politician in North America right now. And I mean that based on his character and on what has happened as a result of his decision-making, his or her, any politician across North America, he's an absolute joke to anybody who thinks that Canada is a place that values liberty and freedom at any level, Justin Trudeau has really made that look like a farce. Beyond that though, Clay, when you see what's happened here, there are far-reaching implications of this kind of decision. You have seen the mobilization of a Western democracy and really really our closest ally. I mean, almost an adjunct state, America, Jr., whatever you want to call it. America's top half. Yeah. You have seen a mobilization of what is effectively either counter, you could say counterinsurgency or counter insurrection powers of the state, to suppress a peaceful political protest. Now, people will remember that it wasn't long ago that there were actual in this country, not really in Canada so much, but in this country, there were riots, ongoing riots causing disorder destruction. They tried to burn down a church across from the White House, right? I mean, we remember what was going on. They're pulling down statues. They were destroying neighborhoods, burning down police stations, trying to burn down a federal courthouse in Portland. And the apparatus of the left was furious with the notion furious with the notion that Trump was sending in any additional law enforcement resources, that was that was thuggery. Those were, you know, jack booted fascists going into Portland or DC or wherever. And now look what Trudeau has done. I mean, Clay, they sent guys in full on head to toe tactical gear with long guns to pull guys out of trucks who had spent the last few days handing out, you know, sandwiches and playing ice hockey in the streets and saying, can we go back to our normal lives? The mobilization of a state of emergency in Canada to break a peaceful protest that is a righteous protest with demands that should be clear to everybody as the way forward is something that I think we're going to unfortunately be dealing with the ramifications of for a long time. You think they're only going to use it against the truckers? Anytime now, there's a protest that seems to come from the right. They may decide, oh, this is, look at the stuff they said, neo-Nazis, Trumpist insurrection. They lied about the movement in order to justify what they did against the movement. It is. I don't want to say that America did well with COVID because we certainly didn't. But if you look at New Zealand and you look at Australia and you look at Canada, three countries that I think most Americans pre COVID would have characterized as relatively easygoing, relatively moderate in the in the politics and the perspectives that they adopt. They all three lost their mind, frankly, in a way we did not. And I think to a large extent, that is because of our federalism, because we had governors in particular, Rhonda Santas, who were willing to look at the data and take risks. And while that might have upset the Blue Check Brigade out there, what it did was it encouraged the other side of the country. And so we had less of a pervasive anger in the United States compared to, I think, what happened in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. They kind of leavened it based on federalism. This is why the discussion, you're totally right. I think you said this a couple of weeks ago, and I've shared this with other folks to attributing it to you, of course, but that where was the American trucker protest for the most part? Well, the truckers who live in Texas and the truckers who live in Tennessee, Florida, and the Dakotas and Montana and Wyoming, they're like, we're kind of okay. They haven't been put through the same degree of what you've seen in Canada. And I mean, as for those other states you mentioned, really the what we used to call the anglosphere, although people don't just for the English speaking nature of it, the US, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Great Britain. There was a madness that COVID unleashed, really a mass hysteria. And I do think that it was very much correlated with the degree of socialism in those countries. We had thought of socialists in the past as, oh, they just want free health care. And, well, but there's also a mentality. Socialists believe in effectively creating a religion of the state, and that if you just give them enough authority and power, they will create a de facto utopia. And that means that also in the event of an emergency, the same people that believe the government can create perfection, think the government is in a perfect position to deal with, you know, deal with a threat like this, but you just have to give it all the authority that it wants. So I think that's why you saw the countries, you know, I do like Australia as East Germany with koalas, and that started to catch on a little bit because I think it's true. You saw people recognizing that the socialist mindset in times of duress lends itself, all of a sudden, the benevolent authoritarianism of a big government socialist state doesn't feel so benevolent anymore. And what's interesting is England today is effectively ending all restrictions. Australia has now opened back up for tourists. New Zealand is acknowledging that zero COVID is no longer a reality. And I believe we were talking about during commercial breaks. Their COVID cases have now surged 24,000 percent or something such as that when they stopped being able to isolate themselves and keep everyone else from coming in the country. And even with Biden as a disastrous leader, I feel in many ways, as if you compare us to all of those other countries that we would ordinarily have considered to be our peer group, that things have gone better than we could have hoped relative to places like Florida. And by the way, we got breaking news that's going to be coming any moment as we are talking to you. Vladimir Putin is going to be making an announcement about Ukraine on Russian television and reports are, we're looking at Fox News right now that Putin is going to declare Eastern Ukraine independent. Exactly what we just talked about. Yeah, Hans Gunz, and that's because they're going to say the separatist regions are now effectively part of Russia. They're going to dare the Ukrainian government to do anything. Now, this is analysis. That's not the breaking news. But we're analog, you know what? We'll come back into this in a second because we're going to need more time on it. But the headline right now up on Fox News, Putin to declare Eastern Ukraine independent is exactly what we were expecting here. We talked about in the last hour of the show. We'll bring you up to speed on that one. But I can tell you this, if Putin is supposed to make an announcement any moment, and that is also that is also supposed to be reported on shortly here, he's not saying it's piece. He's not saying it's peace in our time, friends. That's for sure. We'll talk more about this in a second. We could be at the beginning of war in Europe.

Welcome back to Clay and Buck show. We do have this breaking news about the situation in Ukraine right now. Putin has declared eastern Ukrainian breakaway provinces of of Luhansk and Donetsk to be this is known often referred to as the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. This the declaration here is that they are independent and the assumption that goes along with this would be and now effectively part of Russia. So in much the same way as there was a referendum in Crimea to make it a part of the Russian Federation. And then there was this in this military incursion by Russia into this part of Ukraine back in 2014. They created a beachhead there for what is now the official declaration of the independence of these eastern Ukrainian breakaway statelets. Now look, it's even the language you use here, you'll see it all goes to the Russian Maska Rovka, the war through deception component of this. They want us to be talking about these breakaway. This is Russia seizing parts of Ukrainian territory effectively. That's what's going on. According to Russian TV, Putin has declared eastern Ukraine independent and he has also told his plan to EU leaders. We don't have more details on that yet. We will. But Clay, here's what I think is happening right now. So we told the headlines and now the next steps are, let's say they just leave it at at what we'll call the Donbas eastern Ukraine. If they just have this now as part of Russia, the Russian military, the Russian military situation around Ukrainian borders is such that they could still deal some kind of a knockout blow to the Ukrainian military if they choose to do so. So this may essentially be a provocation to get some kind of response from the Ukrainian government. Because let's say Ukrainian military goes into Donbas and says, these are not, this is, this doesn't fly. Then the Russians go in and say you're attacking Russian speakers, you're not, you know, you're violating their sovereignty and it just becomes this big mess of lies. That's one possibility. The other possibilities of Russians don't even wait for that kind of a movement from the Ukrainian government. Create a false flag inside of, and we're talking about the Russians, by the way, they do do false flags. That's not this not conspiracy stuff. They've done false flags and Chechnya, they do false flags. But Clay, I think that's another possibility where they'll act like they are just waiting, and they just want these regions. And then if there's some kind of a conflagration, they say, oh, they forced our hands. And the question that will be out there is, how long does this form if if Ukraine is going to a seed in some way to the loss of this territory? And they haven't fighting there since like 2014, right? So I mean, this has been a tumultuous region to say the least already. To what extent does this end this story? How long does this, will he or won't he element of the Ukrainian invasion continue in the wake of this? If, again, Putin is going to declare Eastern Ukraine independent, theoretically, then all of Eastern Ukraine becomes a part of Russia. If that occurs, are we talking about this border region continuing to be on tenter hooks for years to come? Or does this dial back the tension here and lead to a resolution for both sides in some form or fashion? Think about what we would see. Let's assume that it stops more or less here and that the Donbas or something roughly analogous to the Donbas, which is really the Eastern and Eastern region of Ukraine, or obviously all along the Russian border. Clay, they could just say Putin could say, this is it. Let's leave it here. And what he would have is essentially in the in the eyes of not just Putin, the Kremlin and the people support him from within the military complex there. But from his supporters inside of Russia, he will have stared down NATO and taken a chunk of lost territory without really any. I mean, there's been some shelling in minor, no significant loss of life for material. He will just have said, I am Putin. Hear me, hear me or else. And taken off a big chunk of Ukraine without having to actually even go to war that I think where we where we are right now is, is he will is that actually sufficient? Well, I think and for a lot of people out there, how would the Biden administration respond to this? They probably would let Russia in theory take this small region of Eastern Ukraine and then hope that this thing just goes away. Yeah. I mean, right? I mean, because the last thing they want is this to linger. They'll put maybe they'll put some sanctions on it and things like that. It does remind me for those who remember the great Tom Clancy in debt of honor, if I recall, the whole point is that the Japanese and Imperial Japanese resurgent right wing, Japanese military strike to take back lost territory from World War II. And their whole thing is, where they're going to take it so fast, Clay, that why fight over it once it's been taken. And it reminds me a little bit of what's going on here. Why why it's already done, guys, why fight over this with us? That's the idea of well, and then the other thing you have to worry about is the precedent that's being said on Taiwan, because China certainly is watching this closely to see how we respond in this situation. 100%.

We are down in Palm Beach on this president's day, getting ready to be with former president Trump 45 himself tomorrow at Marlago right off the top of the show at noon Eastern encourage you to be there hanging out with us. We are right now awaiting official word from Vladimir Putin about what he is going to do. Reports are that he has notified people that he is going to declare Eastern Ukraine to be independent, which would then theoretically allow Russia to take over those parts of Eastern Ukraine as a part of Russia. So we will bring you the absolute latest as that happens. We are obviously monitoring that closely as the show is progressing. But Buck, there are a couple of ridiculous stories that happened over the weekend that I wanted to hit you with. And first, and I can't believe that this is not becoming a bigger story now, although it is starting to cross over outside of just people who have functional brains. We had a transgender swimmer at the University of Pennsylvania, one four different Ivy League championships buck, four different Ivy League championships. And if you haven't paid attention to this story, we're talking about a man who swam for three years on the University of Pennsylvania's team and then decides to become a woman and now is poised with the NCAA championships coming up in a few weeks to potentially become the greatest women's in quotation mark swimmer of all time. And we have such identity politics colliding here, Buck, you have Democrats whose predominant base to a large extent is female voters. And so they don't want to offend women who might enjoy competition. I know a ton of you out there, dads and moms are seething over a story like this. So they're pretending it doesn't exist simultaneously. They're not saying, Hey, men are bigger, stronger, and faster than women just because you decide to become a woman and start taking whatever drugs are necessary in order for that to occur. It doesn't make you not over six feet tall or have bigger hands and feet and be better at swimming than a woman would be, which is what men are. He's effectively had almost 10 years of nature's testosterone therapy already. Let's be honest about this. Right. His biochemistry has been such that he has been receiving as any male listening to this would be receiving the benefits of male biochemistry when it comes to size, strength, speed and those issues. You know, one thing that that brings to bear here, Clay, because it is fascinating and you've you've been reminded me of just how the sports media pretend it doesn't exist should be doing backflips about how amazing what a moment of huge progress this is. Right. You'll notice that when it came to the first, I believe, was it the first transgender cabinet level official that was or maybe a state level, I think it was state level official in Pennsylvania, the health official. It was a huge story. Everybody was praising it. How significant it was, you know, breaking a glass ceiling of sorts or whatever. However, they want to frame it. If this is a good thing, they should view this as an enormously positive story. They want to tell a little place. They know that this is an issue where I think honestly, 80 to 90% of the country is just saying, I think it's like 95%. I think it's crazy. This is this is not anywhere near a 50 50. This is not a Democrat Republican issue. This is a sane versus insane issue. And and it does though remind me of how you have to see it a lot of this starts with an even conservative fall for this. It's about being polite. Let's just be polite. Let's use the preferred pronouns. Let's let's be included. We don't want any field. And I do think that conservatives have culturally a desire for politeness and for courtesy that has often used against us in these things. Like, I don't want anyone to feel bad. I want people to feel good. I want people to feel safe and, you know, have a good day and all the rest of it. But it's not courteous to make 12 year old girls get undressed in their locker room with 12 year boys. It's not polite. Yes, it's not okay. It's not courteous, which is a new policy. It's not courteous to have female swimmers getting annihilated by someone who's a biological male. I mean, what ends up happening is if you don't see this for what it is in the early stages, you know, courtesy cannot be at the expense of truth. Politeness cannot be at the expense of truth. And that's what you see in the transgender issue in sports all the time. I keep coming back to a quote that an anonymous member of this pen swimming team gave to one of our writers, Joe Kenzie at Outkick. And that swimmer said, and I'm paraphrasing her, that she hopes when she is married and has children of her own, that she has boys, because women's sports are going to cease to exist in many ways, if tons of transgender male athletes decide to become a part of women's sports. And by the way, this doesn't go the other direction, right? Because a woman who decides to become a man is never going to be able to compete at the highest level. So it isn't the same level of it's not an attack upon the direct competitive spirit itself. But this is this is to me, a monstrously huge story that is being to a large extent ignored, because it provides an inconvenient lesson, which is biology still matters. And even men who decide to become women are by far better. And look, the analogy that I've used for a long time to sort of demonstrate the difference between men's and women's sports is what goes on when you look at at the state of Texas, for instance, but every single Texas high school state champion recently was faster than high school boy, faster than the fastest woman who's ever existed. Think about how crazy it is, we're talking about 16 17 18 year old boys, all of them are faster than the fastest woman that's ever existed. And yet at some level, we all know that that's the reality, you know, you're giving the data, we all understand though, we've all seen men's and women's sports. We've seen the differences in speed and strength. And there's a reason why we have, you know, segregated sports by sex as long as we have. But this does also go to, I think that when you were the leftist that push this, it's important to think about why they push us, why they believe it said for some, this is an issue of a virtue signaling. They don't really understand the issue. They don't care. And even privately, they may say, yeah, it's kind of unfair, but publicly, they want all the all the trappings of wokeness, you know, oh, I'm in favor of this. Although there are very few people who speak out forcefully who aren't activists, you know, stuff. But you know, the the the the the left in this country clay thinks that reality is a construct. And this goes to the center of their ideology. They think that reality is a construct itself. And they can change reality based upon their desire, based upon their political mobilization. And if they can get you to affirm what is untrue in this case, I think they view it as a glory to make you affirm other things that are untrue as well. It's confusing to you when you're made to say things that you know, if I sat in major repeat things that are untrue, eventually you start to think what is true. And that's part of what the left gains out of this. There's no doubt. And also being afraid to say what the truth is. It's not only saying things that are untrue, it's being afraid to oppose this, which is where almost everyone is right now, as it pertains to this story, which I think is going to continue to become a bigger issue, because there's a possibility here that this transgender male swimmer is going to become the greatest college women swimmer of all time here in the next few weeks already. Ivy League record books being rewritten by a man that decided to become a woman. They're making a mockery of women's sports. That's what they're doing. That's in essence, they are destroying women's sports. By the way, Vladimir Putin now talking in Moscow will come back and discuss what he said moments ago as he is now addressing his people in the country about the situation with Ukraine.

Welcome back into the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show. Thanks for being with us here. Putin is speaking right now on Ukraine. They're calling it tensions up on Fox News. Here is the situation just to bring everybody up to speed as we are seeing this in real time too. Putin is talking right now about the area of Eastern Ukraine that has been the site of Russian incursion, invasion, and the creation of two separatists, non-recognized separatists, republics of Lohansk and Donetsk. This area in the eastern part of Ukraine, the far eastern part of Ukraine is known as the Donbas. Right now, we're hearing from Vladimir Putin as it seems he is declaring independence of these regions. Now, this is a much lesser right now escalation than what was perhaps thought would be happening if we had the opening of hostilities given the size of the Russian military force arrayed along Ukraine's borders. That doesn't mean that this won't escalate very rapidly though. What will the Ukrainian government do in response? Clay, there is a very real chance as we see this unfolding that Putin essentially created a situation where this will look like. Remember, there was all this talk about by putting all of the soldiers, putting all the military assets in place. Maybe it was a head fake to get concessions. Well, maybe he put them all in place because the head fake in a sense is a massive invasion when the actual desire is to just take this eastern portion and it will seem to everybody like, well, at least this didn't turn into open conflict and warfare the way that we thought. So this may defang again, this is we don't know yet. We don't know what their future plans are. But as it stands right now, this could be a move by Putin to outmaneuver and outplay the European and American response because if it's not open war, if it's just the declaration of this official recognition and the Ukrainian government doesn't move against them and the Russians don't escalate, then this becomes a day factor reality in the ground. They've been giving out Russian passports in this region for weeks already. So they're creating a reality on the ground of these are Russian speakers and Russian citizens and we leave it there. That's what could be happened. And to be fair, a lot of these people might well prefer to be Russian, right in the border region. I mean, something like 85% consider themselves to be of Russian ethnic origin as opposed to Ukrainian. And so if he has been selling the idea of I'm going to take over the whole country and provoking all of this, all of this fear that this was going to spiral into something far larger. And then ultimately, this is the price to pay. I mean, really the question is, well, how is Ukraine going to respond now, right? Do they have any recourse here? Because I can't imagine that they are very appreciative on having part of this, part of this, of their territory just taken away. And the question is, is this going to be enough? Or is this a prelude to something more significant going forward? But again, as we are, as we are watching, we'll eventually have official translation of this, but Putin has been declaring independence for parts of Ukraine. And we need to check and see the other thing I was going to check Buck is, what is the reaction of the stock market in general? Because initially, on reports of this potentially occurring, the obviously the stock market is closed today for President's Day, I believe. But the futures on the stock market had declined pretty precipitously in the last hour or so, as people became aware of what might be taking place. So there is something of a playbook for this. The Russians have run this before at the very end of the Bush administration. So you're going back to now, I think what was it, August 2008, you had this, this escalation that in a region of Georgia, the country of Georgia, where you had breakaway republics of South of Sedia and Abkhazia. And the Russians did, it was very similar. There were some shelling and some we need to step in here to protect the Russian speakers in the region. And you had these little breakaway republics and keep in mind that the Russians effectively got their way and got away with this. This is what actually ended up, this is, this was from their perspective a success. So it is not really surprising that there is a similar campaign going on here or similar play, it seems being made, as Putin is officially declaring now and as he said, as Fox is translating this, you know, the Western news outlets are translating this in real time. And Putin has declared it. He says that Ukraine has always been a part of Russia, that these Eastern regions are now independent, Lajanskin, Donetsk, fascinating clay. There has been some reporting on in the past who were at who were some of the top officials of these non recognized now recognized by Vladimir Putin, of course, breakaway republics. It was actually a dog catcher and a former mall Santa that were running the governments in essence were at the very top of the governments of these breakaway republics. The point here being the Russians are running them. They just found local people to pretend to be the Russian puppets, if you will, and try to get all this set up for what we're seeing right now. Do you believe this lessons or increases tension going forward based on this news happening literally as we are talking at this moment? Is it your indication of, because I'm looking at the stock market, the stock market is down around 2% than Azdak is. The Dow is down a little bit over a percent. Obviously that's not those aren't monster moves, but it suggests discomfort with what's going on. So you could look at what did we do in response to Crimea? What do we do in response to have Kazia and South Ossetia? What do we do in response to the initial incursion in Eastern Ukraine? Some sanctions some, but did we do was there when I say we by the way, let's refer to it. I don't just mean America. I mean, in NATO, Europe, the West, not a whole lot. If it stops here, if it stops here, yeah, there'll be sanctions, there'll be diplomatic wrangling, but Putin gets this part of Ukraine back for the Russian Federation without actually having to fight, which is a huge win for him. So what are what are the responses going to be here? Diplomatic and sanctions. That's it. Obviously no one's suggesting right now in this country, NATO is going to go and do anything about these breakaway republics. If they leave it here, Putin might walk away with a win, but then the question is, how long lasting is that? Last, what's the next stop? Is he, you know, is the alligator going to want to bite off more of Ukraine next? That's the problem with the Russian bear, as the case may be, that that's the question that we'll be faced with. But if he if it stops right here, man, this might be Putin outplaying his Western counterparts and getting his way like a a cunning thug. We'll have to see we got Rand Paul, Senator Rand Paul joining us here in a few minutes. We'll ask him about this, by the way, because Senator Rand Paul is always a sound mind on foreign policy matters. What's going on in Ukraine as he sees it plus the CDC and Fauci, you know, that's going to be fun. Stick around for it."
