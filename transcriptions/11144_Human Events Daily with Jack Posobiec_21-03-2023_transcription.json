    "text": " Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard today's edition of human events daily powered by turning point USA today is March 21st, 2023 ano Domini last week. We had Libby Evans on this program and we were talking about the kids and It basically comes down to this the kids are not all right from the trans contagion to the issue with The labor force participation dating even driving. It's just not happening anymore. What's going on? So today here on human events. We're gonna talk about it. Ladies and gentlemen, let's get into it. I Want to take a second to remind you to sign up for the post so daily brief. It is completely free It'll be one email that sent to you every day you can stop the endless scrolling trying to find out what's going on in your World we will have this delivered directly to you totally for free go to human events comm slash poso sign up today It's called the post so daily brief read what I read for show prep you will not regret it human events comm Post so totally free the post so daily brief Hi, I was once a trans youth and now I'm a happy 22 year old trans adult student at new College of Florida This is my health care ma'am. Okay, don't tread on it Senator Yarbrough has militarized the Florida GOP into the genital Gestapo Rhonda Santis once trans people dead you are committing genocide. I grew up in Germany in the aftermath Nazis and what you people are doing is no different is this transphobic? It is And you really should be ashamed what you were doing by signing this bill is an act the way it is as it is now My people will die and that blood if you support this bill will be on your hands. I'm 12 year old. I'm not buying If you pass this bill many of us will die. I deserve to live as long as all of you. We are humans too All right now. Let me bring in Libby Emmons on this now Libby you and I were talking about this whole situation last week and it sort of came up as a statistic that we were getting into but I understand that you're working on a piece that I hope you're gonna be Publishing on human events comm About how did we get here so Libby the floor is yours? Yeah, so I am working on a piece and I think that it's really important to talk about what's going on with so-called trans youth and trans kids which I think is really a fiction Made up by parents and educators and activists and men who really want you to believe that they are women and Everyone wants to know how we got here How did we get to a place where men think they're women if they say they are where parents seek to inject their kids with drugs to stop their natural development in service to the lie that human beings can change sex and We got here through the weaponization of compassion the emergence of a feminist fascism and a willingness to declare that lies are truth Those threads of this movement likely go back further into the past than I can recall I watched much of this emerge in my own lifetime and we went from the political correctness movement of the late 80s and 1990s which I experienced in high school into the elevation of oppression as a virtue and straight into the grievance culture of identity politics I think we all saw this happening I think we could you know look at it and we obliterated our God We told ourselves that reality is relative and what we really did is we embraced death over life And it started a lot of it if you go back to abortion the reframing of abortion as health care and the willingness to sterilize Children and teens in order to help them achieve their goals to remake their physical appearance We have said is a culture that human reproduction is not as important or essential as looking the way you want or living without responsibilities or encumbrances but really these are adult perspectives and adult wants and as a justification of those wants adults them onto children They have men and drag read to impressional preschoolers telling us this this is so little kids know it's okay to be different But actually it is leading it is grooming it is telling them not to trust their own bodies grown men like Rachel Levine tell us trans kids exist because those men want to believe that they are not living out of fetish But that they were actually innately the opposite sex from birth They mutilate our children in service to their own desires It's not reality universities and institutions have adopted and internalized these ideas They come about books and articles and graduates that seek to destroy our culture in the name of liberating it educators librarians Artists doctors and politicians see themselves as activists in service to a mission And we know that one cannot serve to master that once Our culture and its purveyors are slaves to ideology and they refuse to see or acknowledge truth So where does that leave us? I? Mean it just it makes you feel uncomfortable right and and and there was something that and you and I are talking a little bit before the show that We got into this it seems like people are And I guess we've all kind of been guilty of this in a sense, but people are living their online lives in their primary Mode as opposed to living their real actual physical, you know meat space lives I'm first and so in many of these cases whether it be it started with tumbler It's turned Twitter to an extent now tiktok Instagram, but yeah, really tiktok It's almost as if these online communities which seek to pervade these senses of thinking are then taking over That their lives and then they are completely going into this and and so trans obviously I think is the most extreme example of it, but it's not the only example and I want people to understand that Yeah, it's not the only example and a lot of what you're talking about certainly started back with tumbler if people remember tumbler which was You know the early version of this and on tumbler you had a lot of people coming out as trans you had a lot of community Embracing each other and saying hey, you're really trans And I think a lot of what happened to as people went online to create their own Avatars was that we shut down real life during the pandemic. So we had three years Where adults basically did whatever they wanted they went out and protested They wore masks or didn't wear masks or anything else, but we shut down schools We shut down playgrounds of all the ridiculous things we shut down churches We shut down all of the places where children and teens can go hang out with each other Parks in New York City were closed kids can't go anywhere if they can't go to the park Our caves were closed we shut down so many different things and all kids could do was go online To speak with their friends. This is all they could do. I remember as a parent being really conflicted because my son was not able to see his friends in person He wasn't allowed to go to school. They weren't allowed to go to school and his friends parents were freaked out by COVID I was not as freaked out as them at all. I was saying let's all meet up at the park Let's do this and that and let's try, you know, even once parks got more open But my son ended up talking to his friends online an awful lot And this is what so many kids did and it wasn't just talking to each other But talking to new people strangers was talking to a friend of mine the other day who said that her child Who's in high school does not have friends at school all of his friends are online Another one of my friends heard We are just hold that thought we are just about to hit our first break. I know I know I know I don't want to stop you What we are gonna go on a commercial break and then I want to continue immediately after this because look I've got kids as well But yours are yours are older there they're older your son is older So I want to get into this stay tuned be right back human events daily Libby Emmons And we're back here human events daily Libby Emmons you had to cut you off for the commercial break But you were telling us a story about your son the lockdowns its effect on him and others please continue Yeah, so it wasn't just my son who ended up locked inside during the lockdown pandemics while adults went and flitted about whatever they pleased from protesting to drinking out to doing whatever they wanted But we locked the kids inside and he spent all of his time, you know when he was being social it was online I have another friend I mentioned whose son his only friends are online and I have another friend whose Child actually went through gender transition and lives as the opposite sex and my friend was telling me that her daughter Who's actually her daughter has had a relationship and that her daughter was very upset with the relationship ended And I was asking a little about it just inquiring and it turned out that the entire romantic relationship had happened online And the two had never actually met in person. I found this rather stunning I can understand certainly how the ending of a friendship like that Would be difficult, but at the same time why aren't these kids meeting up in person? Why aren't they even interested in being in the same place and holding hands and all of the other things that Certainly marked our upbringings As older people and how we lived as teens Well, you can't bring it you can't bring kids the theater. You can't bring kids out. So It also speaks to something and I've heard people talk about this as well, which they refer to as Even more broadly than in their pandemic the the loss of third spaces and What is a third space and so a third space the way I consider it or the way that I've heard people explain it is a third place It's not your home and it's not some place you have to be so it's not it's not school. It's not church It's it is a place to hang out. It is a place to shop. It is a place to To be entertained a place to Commun with others, but you could you could meet people It's it's not a you know, you know, you can kind of argue back and forth whether or not, you know supermarkets constitute third places You know if you're talking to any of the day-dating gate guys They would say yes unequivocally, but I think most people just kind of look at it as sort of a you know, sort of essentials But bookstores, you know used to serve this purpose as well. It's not many places It can be it can be church can be I would say it's not work or school or home. It's right. It's not work or school or home It's a third place and so Why is it though Libby that we've been losing third places in this country? I think in a lot of ways we've been losing meaning and as we lose meaning we lose the places that we are drawn to based on our own You know interests so these could be the gaming places where kids would go and play chess perhaps I know that there's still one on Mcdoodle Street Where people go and play chess? This is churches churches got shut down during the pandemic and we've already seen that so many people Who left church during the pandemic did not actually go back? Church doors closed and many of them once they opened again, they had hardly as many people Coming back into those Faces we also have lost our idea of doing things together You know, so what are you supposed to do when you get together? Are you all supposed to sit around and stare at your phones? If anyone goes to a diner and they see teenagers For the record for the record For the record I did have dinner with a 76 year old man last week and His phone sat on the table during that dinner, but they were not turned on once For the hours that we sat there not once yeah, I think more of us should do things like that I have trouble doing that myself because I'm constantly on call for work So if someone is you know needing to talk to me I tend to Identify who you work at human events who could incessantly be contacting you at all hours of the night at by phone and and Text and any other digit I can't imagine who that was can imagine who that would be What if someone's like I need a song to come up now? I didn't have a line this is only be done in 24 minutes. You know, that's that's all Barrett Obviously, we're talking about Barrett. Yeah, it's obviously not you no force not me. No. Oh Barrett sometimes Hannah Yeah, you know she gets Not me But yeah third spaces I have trouble coming up with a third space Well, you know what else though too because you look it's it's also has to do with the way we've designed our towns or the We've undesigned our towns, right? So we've undesigned towns in in outside of cities. We've undesigned towns to be suburban sprawl and You know strip malls and shopping centers rather than your town square Which would be centered typically around, you know church courthouse then you have your businesses then spokes off of that would be would be the homes and and then you might or you might have a secondary church or a school would be would be there and so This is something that people are actually starting to do in other parts of the country where they're building new towns And they're using the old system because a lot of zoning laws and developers and people got together and said They didn't want to build these things anymore. So that's what killed Main Street So Main Street goes away, but then you at least had shopping malls and so late 70s Obviously their hey day was 80s 90s Was shopping malls were made where this became this new Main Street that people would go to congregate and shop and and mingle but then With the rise of the internet that started taking away the shopping mall And now it's even worse because you don't even need to go to the shopping center anymore if you need really need something you Have someone deliver it to you from a piece of glass in your hand, right? You just you know whether it's Postmates or Uber Eats or whatever just Amazon in general if you don't need it Immediately we've gotten to the point where we are so Incredibly atomized that I think I think humans are yearning for social connection and it's not just kids and this you know We talk about why aren't kids dating why are kids driving why are kids online? More eyes is trans coming up because of this. I think it's all the above I think it's literally all of the above but folks a lot of people complain about the state of our country or the way Corporations treat us and their employees But it's not enough to just complain we actually need to change the way that marketplace works And that starts with you how you spend your money unless then one year public square has grown to be the largest platform of patriotic Freedom-loving businesses that this world has ever seen whether you want to support a restaurant that only buys from local farms I'll coffee shop that took a stand against covid Maynades or a bank that would never cancel you for your political views public squares your guide There's also an interactive sensor-free community group where you can connect with other local members Here's the best part it's absolutely free to join just go to public square calm That's public sq.com and download the app today So be creating an account and begin your search you can also list your business for free so your local community can support you Look we can't always change the world But we can change how and where we spend our hard-earned dollars begin your search today at public square public sq.com So, you know Libby what what was so worrisome in In the 80s the 90s even the 70s, you know, you might be worried about your kids getting into drugs You might be worried about your kids getting into a gang You might be worried about your kids go into going to a concert, you know in Philly area You know, I mean I hung out in in Philly as a teenager going to concert after concert after concert every single venue in that city You know twice or more, you know electric factory how many times right? but Today it's it's not the music industry or The the gangs or and the drug just still there. That's that's obviously, you know That's obviously still huge even a worse issue now because there's so much more powerful and potent and then they were in the past and And deadly with the rise of fentanyl, but also you got big pharma involved and big pharma isn't just trying to They're not just out there right they're not just out there Hanging out the shingles saying hey come by there. They're targeting your kids and that's where big pharma and The internet culture and the loss of third spaces. That's kind of where it all Connects isn't it Libby and so instead of instead of oh well, I you know, I had a bad You know a bad breakup at at school or something and so I'm gonna go hang out my friends at the mall Now it's I had a bad breakup. So I'm gonna go cut off part of myself I'm gonna go get a skin graft on my forearm. I'm going to go and or even in some cases You know you're talking about pre puberty in some of this So walk us through a little bit about what actually is going on there when it comes to even the younger children Yeah, there's a case in California right now where a young woman who had her breasts removed at the age of 13 13 is suing Kaiser Permanente for that double mastectomy that That she had saying that she was too young to consent for that and any 13-year-old girl is of course far too young To be able to consent to something like that Um, it's shocking to see this and then you have people on the left and they can't decide the progressive left They can't decide if these kinds of mutilations of our children never happen or if it's good that they happen You have people advocating for gender affirming care like our illustrious president Biden right now Who doesn't even know what it means and when we say gender affirming care that is a carefully constructed euphemism to say that um You know children should have access to this what they call care But what it really is is chemical castration. It is stunted growth It is the application of cross-sex hormones and it is in some cases Jurassic surgeries that change your life and your body forever There are so many cases now of young girls and I I'm speaking of young girls because it is among young girls that a huge Increase in trans identification has occurred. So you do see it with young boys too Do you see it with young boys as well? But for young boys they are not uh, the medical industry is not tending to um Invert their penises. I This the term really typically until the boys are 17 or 18 years old Which also is far too young for anyone to make that kind of determination So when we couple the idea that children our uh, teens are not dating children obviously should not be dating But when we couple the idea that teens are not dating with the uh, push toward They're using their bodies to create their own avatars um, and then growing up to find that uh, the The idea that they could switch sex has actually been a total lie We see how we got here, right? Because how can a person a teenager who's never been on a date recognize That they might want their body parts Well, and and the younger they get you right the younger they get you when you are faced with that lie Now you're hooked on prescription medication for the rest of your life Uh, bident's up there with admiral levine trying to make this Um federal law that every insured they're using obama care for this by the way that under the aca They are trying to make it so that every insurance Every insurance pool in this country that you pay into so you and I and libby actually were on the same insurance Well, we're not but we have to be that's another that's different story get a little personal there but um but You will be paying into this so that every insurance pool will be will be covered and potentially even you know for the the disadvantaged You might even have taxpayer services covering this. That's what they are trying to entrain in federal law now And and this is by the way, so this is the number one. This is what big pharma and i'll use the phrase and this isn't my phrase This isn't my phrase. This is what the activist or whatever you want to call that thing at the beginning said the genital gestapo This is the genital gestapo and you know who's behind the general gestapo big pharma That's exactly right. They are behind that um and they are interested in creating lifelong patients They're doing a great job If you don't have kids who are on antidepressants Um and you know, whatever else to treat their fictitious adhd which even the doctor who coined the phrase adhd Uh has said that he basically made it up So your kids are always going to be pressed to be put on something right but how many kids get stuck on on on the ritalin Would you never hear about that anymore on prozac right suddenly? It's because this is what happens is you have these designer drugs that come out These name brand drugs and then suddenly you also have all these doctors going throughout television Throughout the media telling you about these these these terrible new disorders That you have to you have to try the ritalin's gonna what it's like putting eyeglasses on your brain Remember that they say that it's like eyeglasses on your brain Um that was one of those it's it's all marketing and somebody's And there's a reason they're all rather the embed use right? I mean if you're gonna take a bunch of speed yeah, you're gonna be hyper focused But that's not what your kids need your kids don't need speed so that they can be hyper focused They need to learn how to focus learn how to use their brains Learn how to work with the intelligence that they have and figure out how to navigate life They don't need to be drugged. We should know this puberty blockers are not attempt do not result in the temporary changes these are permanent changes There are neurological changes and moreover doctors and the media used to know this they knew this before 2016 There was an article today that I was looking at that a friend sent me from 2015 where pbs far left pbs was talking about the difficulties surrounding medicine for Children and teens who identify as transgender was talking about the components of brain development that happened during puberty with when hormones washed through the brain It was talking about the various different risks and how Careful doctors really need to be and it noted also that boston children's hospital was the first one to pioneer these early kinds of You know medical treatments for lack of a better word back in 2007 Libby we are we are just about out of time for the episode Um, I'm I'm hope that this your piece can get up very soon human events.com Where else can people go to get your coordinates and follow you?
