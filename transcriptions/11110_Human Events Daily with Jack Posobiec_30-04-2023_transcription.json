It's called the POSO Daily Brief. Read what I read for show prep. You will not regret it. Humanevents.com slash POSO. Totally free the POSO Daily Brief. All right. We are excited to welcome back here to Human Events for the first time on the Human Events Sunday Special. Mr. Primetime99 himself, the host of Primetime with Alex Stein. It is, folks. Unfortunately, I'm sorry. We brought him back. It's Alex Stein. Alex. Look, you know, we had a snafu. We had like a much more important guest than you that was going to come on today, but then they bailed. So, you know, we just kind of called you up to see if that was all right. That's cool with you, though, right? Of course, Jack, you're going to bring me on. You're going to buck break me immediately. Oh, I'm the backup guest. But I'm Primetime99, Alex Stein. I'm, you know, a pimp on a blimp. So listen, this, I'm a good guest. Anybody else you would have got? You're not going to have the energy, the charisma, or the pizzazz that I'm about to have. So you were actually the stunt double for Tariq Neshido, weren't you? I would have been the stunt double for a treatment machine. But you know, it's funny you say that, Jack, because actually I started off a little bit about Alex Stein Cannon, the history of, I actually started off as an extra and mini productions on the office, on multiple commercials, the dark night. It's always sunny in Philadelphia. So it's funny, though, that you bring that up, the stunt doubles, because I actually did a couple stunts where I played a football player on Spider-Man and I had to get my ass kicks. So it's funny you say that because I've actually been a stunt double when I was like 23 years just hilarious. I'm actually in, I've got two of those, actually, or technically three, I suppose. So I did BG as an extra on, was that show Veep with Julie Louis-Dreyfus? So did you remember? Did they fill that DC? Wait, wait, real quick. Jack, they filled that DC? Oh, wow. They did, yeah, they did it at the time. So of course, because you need like the DC area stuff. And so if you remember the episode, but funny enough, the episode I was in was not the one that's in DC. I'm in the episode where they're going to visit. It's like this, it's kind of like a parody of Google and it's called Clovis. And she's like running for president. And I'm one of the security guards who's like walking around with, but I was like with everybody all day. She's awesome, by the way. She's hilarious. And people don't realize how cool that is. You get to have lunch with them. You're on set with them. I mean, obviously you're the lowest on the totem pole. No, Nathan Hale. But they were really nice, actually. They were really cool. They were like, no issues. And then the other show that I did was House of Cards. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Kevin's face. Kevin's face. When you're in a scene with Kevin? What are we in a scene with Kevin? I was. I am in a scene with Kevin. Yeah. So if you look, there's an episode. So they needed military guys. They're still in the military. And we took leave and a bunch of us went and we showed up in uniform. But they gave us these blue helmets or not blue helmets, like a beret. And so we were doing this deployment to some fake Middle Eastern country. And then he's announcing it standing in front of us with Robin Wright right there. Jenny from Forrest Gump, and then Kevin Spacey is right there. It's kind of weird, though, because he kept going to the younger actors and asking if they could come run lines with him in the back. Shut up, Nathan Hale. No, no, no. Not about that. And by the way, had I seen anything like that, I would have been like, yo, what's going on? But no, there wasn't even a set. Honestly, he was he was really nice, totally normal. But you know, like people like that when there's a lot of people around, you know, not to, you know, do that kind of thing. Yeah. Well, industry secret, a lot of people don't realize this either is that in Hollywood, and that's a place where there's like people that actually do extra work. They join the sag and they get, you know, they get like, you know, 600 bucks a deal. But this is the thing. Somebody with your haircut, like a short haircut that can play military or cop. There's endless amounts of roles because there's constantly cop roles. I'm saying that is like the best thing if you're a background, right? Military experience. They'll hire you. Oh, you're in the military. Oh, we need you because there's every movie has a good military scene, you know? So it's just funny how there's a lot of and commercials, every commercial, even if it's a commercial for Doritos, you know, there's always them. We need a cop or military. So it's just funny how you can actually like do that. There's people that do that nine to five or whatever. They're weird hours are. Yeah. The one was security. The one was military. And then the other other other other one that I've done and I get hit with this all the time is I was in the movie when I lived in China. I was in the movie for bid and kingdom with Jackie Chan and Jet Li. Wow. And you could you see yourself? You're on camera? No, and I'm like, oh, I have a line. No, wow. So they, so this is the one. So it's Michael Argerano. And he's the kid from, what was he, the sky high and some other stuff. He was on, he was, he was on 24 and he got, he got, he got shot by, who's the, he got shot by, who's, what's the name of the actor who plays Kumar? You know, from Mike Castle. I know that got new new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, new, who plays, Calpent, Calpent, Calpent, you got shot by Calpent. I like it. It was to male and John. And so he was all with micro-algerano. And then, so they were looking for people back when I lived in Shanghai and I was doing my study abroad there. And they were like, hey, we have this Jackie Chan thing and we're looking for Americans because we need you to the scene that's like in Boston and we're looking for like some like Boston Tufts, you know, and like Southie or whatever. And I went out, a bunch of us went out for it. And so we sat and we watched the, we watched the departed like three times the night before like all the just to be checked all the way down. You were having fun. Got to be extra-basting, you know. You got to go, yeah, drive for a couple of hours in a car, drive, pack the car, have a yacht, you know. And, and I got it, you know, I got it. I don't know. So I'm in, I'm in a couple of scenes, you know, we beat up this kid and then one of the other guys in the gang shoots Jackie Chan. And then so right after he gets shot, I get my, I get my big star turn. So they shoot Jackie Chan. He's like the owner, owner of this pawn shop at the time. And I just look at my go, the hell man. And they made me say it like that. The hell man. Like that's not a Boston thing at all, but whatever. So and then like the kid gets transported to China. He learns kung fu, Jackie Chan and Jetley fight. It's a whole thing. And then he comes back and beats the saw up and we run away. Big, big fun, big fun man. I love Hollywood. People don't know what it's like. That's sad that Hollywood, it's sad that Hollywood's dying because like everybody should have an experience to go be an extra on a set and kind of see what it's like. Because there's good vibes. Just like even with your show, even with my production, you know, people that like to create kind of gravitate towards each other. So it's kind of a fun community. When you're like low on the totem pole. And I feel like Tom Cruise fighting with some actor to be the lead guy. I'm sure that's totally different. But just being on a movie set is fun. Like on any capacity, even the caters like it. So I would encourage everybody to go out there. If you're you don't need advice for me, but go a sign up to be an extra just try it. It is not necessarily a career choice, but it's you know, got me though, man. It was the downtime. The downtime just got me so bad. Hurry up. Yeah, you just sit there anyway. But it's kind of fun to say I used to do it. So I used to get all the 18 little young girls on a first move to California after a graduate college because they don't have a lot of actors under 18. And I looked young at the time and it would be fun for me because I would sit on set all day and I didn't have any friends in LA. So I'd meet everybody. So it was almost like a social gathering. So that's why I really liked it. But enough about being a fake actress, even though you're a real actor. Tell me this. So in the Jackie Chan movie, was it a SAG movie since it was filmed in Shanghai? They probably didn't have any union requirements today. That's right. Yeah. Right. So it was actually interesting because it was like Rob Minkoff was the director. So like at the highest level, it was people from Hollywood, right? But then they're like most of the crew were people from like just locals, right? People from China or Hong Kong that flew up. We filmed it in Hongdian, which is like just south of Shanghai for a couple hours by train. And then and then there were just like random other people like me or whoever to come in. And what's funny is because after we did it, you know, they were even saying they were like, hey, do you want to do like more like we had dinner with Jackie Chan, took us all to dinner and like his assistant. And I think we're still like Facebook friends and was like, hey, do you want to do some more movies that we need more people with like this level of experience? Like 2006, 2006. They need American actors in China. I'm guessing. Right. Exactly. Right. Exactly. So they were like, they were like trying to recruit me into that. And then I remember a couple of months later and I was still there and they said, I said, Hey, Jackie's doing his next picture. Do you want do you want to do something? And I was like, what is it? And they said, they said, okay, we're doing a remake of karate kid. And but it's going to be set. And do you remember this? Um, and it's, um, it's Jaden Smith plays the, the actor or play kid. And it's, and it's Jackie Chan. And they're in China. And I remember, I remember the time being like, well, if this is China and it's Jackie Chan, then it's not karate because Mr. Miyagi, that's Japanese. That's not Chinese. They should call it the Kung Fu kid. And they're like, no, but we want it to be, we want it to be a remake. And I was like, well, then that's not the, but it's not Kung Fu. It's, it's not karate. It's Kung Fu. So why are you doing that? And I was like, no, I don't want to do that. And then it was like a total flop. And like, he stopped doing it. He stopped turning. I can't believe, I can't believe you're such a method actor that you even know the methodology of the martial arts, you know, wouldn't be the proper martial arts from that. I mean, karate karate karate karate is Japan. No, I can't. I can't remember what it was. Everybody. Everybody is. Take what everybody is an Indian. Nobody even knows anything about anything. They don't know that they're using China, Japan, Ukraine or Russia or Belarus or right, right, right. It's all the same. It's all the same. It's all the same thing, man. It's all the same. And I was just like, I don't know, man, that seems weird. Like, I think I'm starting here as you go going to ramp up. People don't even know the 50 states, which is we think that they know about freaking Shanghai or China. You know what I mean? It's funny. It's because like, so like, because like, you know, Tony, even my life, that she comes from from Belarus. And so she, when she came to the US, she was like, she's like, look, I mean, and she's lived all over the country, which is funny, but she's like, look, you know, when you're growing up outside the country, outside the US, like you basically know that like there's New York, there's LA, there's Vegas, and then like, you kind of have like a general sense of Washington, DC, but like, and that's it. And there's a whole bunch of whatever in the middle. Like that's basically what people think. Yeah. You forgot to mention Texas because your wife loves country music. So she has. Yes. This is true. This is true. And I told you that story in Austin last weekend. So yeah, she knows Texas, but I think like outside the US, Texas, Nashville, it's just not, it's not as well known. That's all I'm trying to say. I'm talking to the foreigner view of America before you get here is like, they know Vegas. They know. Yeah. I would. I mean, they know Cowboys, right? They know like Cowboys and then because Cowboys is like the look, like if you're an American, you're a cowboy, that's the whole and people, you know, all the lives will be like, oh, it's actually based on the gaucho would come from like shut up. Like everybody knows that like the Marlboro man is an American, like the Marlboro man is obviously an American. There's no question about that. And so it's, it's literally the most American thing you can think of. So yeah, that's true. I would say the cowboy, like archetype is known more necessarily than Texas itself, which of course, Texas is its own country. So shout out to all the Texans. Yeah, well, they want to make it its own country, but I don't know that that would be the end of the Republic. So I don't, I don't necessarily love the idea of Texas, but I don't like the federal government either. I'm an anti-federalist. I guess you can call myself too, because I think they're so, you know, incompetent when it comes to people management systems. I mean, do you really think the government is very competent? I mean, when you see, you know, I mean, it's a work. Exactly. But I know this is what pisses me off is this a bipartisan thing. Everybody knows the government sucks on the left and the right, but we're just constantly bickering about drag queen story time, which I'm part of that problem, sadly. But it's like, why aren't we actually like talking about how we're being overtaxed or how all of our money is being allocated to foreign countries instead of, you know, on our own border where we're having crisis is like the, you know, like, you know, for Texas in Mexico is having the worst drug trafficking and sex trafficking crisis ever. And we get no support. Literally, I think it's like the Department of Homeland Security. They don't even give them. I don't even think they raised their budget. I mean, they were literally that strained. It's just insane what's happening, but they don't want to spend any of that money here in America. I don't get it. No, because they don't want to spend money. We talked about this reason on the show where it's like, it's like, we just want to be the globalist American empire, the GAE, and we're going to spend money overseas and we're going to stretch ourselves thin and we're going to, you know, we're going to, we're going to make sure that those drag queen story hours, they're not just happening in the United States. We need them in Botswana. We need them in Bosnia. We need them every part of the world needs to be having the drag queen story hours. And it's like, it's like, is this America's greatest export? Libby Emmons from, from human events in postponio. She actually said it's kind of like this very same people who will attack Christian colonization or like the Christianization of the world that, that a company, Western expansion. Um, they're all doing the exact same thing with drag queen story hour and wokeness and the LGBT agenda in general, they're going and pushing that into like Africa and countries where you literally will get strung up in the middle of town, first off like that, and that they're pushing it in the same way because they view it as, as like a religion. Jack, we have Admiral Rachel Levine. That is mockery. I mean, the fact that the greatest Admiral in American history, forget about all those World War two Admiral's bullhalls, he Nimitz. No, no, no, no, no, no. What did they ever do? What barriers did they ever break? All they beat was Japan. I mean, come on. We just dropped the bombs anyway. That has nothing to do with it. They never put on pantyhose and a bra. So that's what it takes. You got it. And you had to be sick though. I mean, but why why has the military become so trans? I mean, what the heck? We have all these leaders. They show that photo of like our military and the Chinese military. And they're like, is this drag queen story hour? Is this like an actual meeting of government importance? You can't even really tell what's real or fake. Well, I think it's because it's because of what you just said, right? So the government is incompetent, but they're competent when they want to be. Right. And so the military, even though we have this like Hollywood view of the military, that's that's perpetuated through so many movies. Every other Netflix movie is like the military or honestly, these more like FBI CIA, like they're all these superheroes and they just savant us from the evil and we don't even know how much they do. And we should just always trust them no matter what, you know, they just looking out for us in the shadows. But when it really comes down to it, the military is directly controlled by the federal government. And so if the government gets controlled by people who believe in social engineering, then they look at the populace of the US military. And I say this as a veteran that when you've got the military, you don't only have the you don't only have the people who are serving, you have their families as well. So the people who are living on base, the people who are being educated on base, the people who go to base health care, the people who are in base housing, the people who shop at the commissary, right? That's all on base. That's all one insular world that's directly controlled. You're talking tons of people. It's by I think if you if you computed it the same way that we compute like like private enterprises, it would be the largest corporation in the country, the US Department of Defense. And then that's not even to include contractors, civilians, et cetera. So when they have direct control, those are the people that they're going to push the social engineering on first. And that's exactly what they've done. Yeah, it's kind of like we can only say so much, but I mean, I feel like in the military, people were complaining about the vaccine, but every single event was like, dude, I took 35 vaccines in the military. I have no idea of what I took. So you're right. Why it is like we use the military as a guinea pig. And you have to, you know, you know, what they do in boot camp, right? With the vaccines. What they just make you go through line and they just, I mean, we call it like vaccine alley. So when I was in boot camp, Navy boot camp, it was like vaccine alley and you just you just walk down and you're just like you're in line with like a hundred other guys, right? They're all there and you're in like your skivis and your and your t-shirt, you know, and and you just walk down and they're like, they give you two pieces of gauze and they're like, hold the gauze like this. And you say, okay. And then you walk down and this guy is like, Hey, this is whatever shot boom. And then you put the gauze on and you go to the next guy down line. And this is whatever shot you go boom. He puts that on and say, all right, take that off and do it again. And then you're just doing it shot after shot after shot after shot until the very last one. And that don't go in your shoulder. That goes somewhere else. Wow. That's a very special last shot. Dude, and you know, this is another bipartisan thing. Why don't we give vets a free how? I mean, I know we have the GI bill or something, but you know, why are there so many homeless vets addicted to drugs? I mean, these people are serious PTSD, especially the people that had combat duty. You know, I know it is the biggest corporation, but so it seems like they'd have enough money. I mean, seems like they're, you know, instead of buying one of these, you know, I'm just saying one of these nuclear weapons or whatever, why don't you just allocate one of those weapons and maybe buy these people some land, a house or give them something I just, and then I'm not saying this to virtue single, but just the idea that a lot of the homeless that we see today are vets. And I'll ask them, like, when you kind of see, and I'm not trying to racially profile because there's black guys too, but like I'll see kind of like, you know, just kind of like a normal, youngish looking white guy. And I'm like, where you vet? And oftentimes I always say, yes, when I go to these, like, you know, where these drug dens are here in Dallas. And I'm just like, man, it's just sad because obviously you could blame it on the drugs, but a lot of times they're using these drugs. There's a medicating pain that the government, you know, that they went through in the military. So it's just sad that we don't give them enough support, you know? Well, and plus two, you know, when you look at this from like a national security perspective too, we've seen people like, like pilots. We've seen people who have, because you've got, you've got knowledge, right? You've got knowledge of how the United States military fights, what the United States military is up to our operations. You've got training. And their times were like other countries. They'll just go hire you. So China will hire our pilots. And it's like, why aren't we thinking about this? Because these people obviously need not just not to mention the PTSD issues, but also these retention issues that you got a national security question on your problem. They should there be some job where, okay, if you're a pilot, we're going to make sure you're set up for a commercial flight or, you know, whatever it is, transportation flight. If you're doing, you know, logistics, supplies, whatever, you know, fly cargo plane. I don't care. Point is that if we were if we were a serious country, right, which I know that's, that's kind of like the main point of this is that we're not a serious country. We're serious about certain things like drag queen story hour and making sure that everybody gets that actually one of the last one of the last trainings I had to do, I actually had to sit through the transgender training in the military. I did. Wow. Before, before Trump, and I remember it was this big room with like a bunch of like crusty old dudes and, you know, guys who have been in the Navy for like 20 years, guys who've been even longer than that sitting there, like, uh, am I supposed to just nod my head and go along? It was like a Sunday morning and everybody had to be there and it was required. And even the commander who was giving the speech was like given, given the training was just sort of reading the cards. And I remember there was this one. It was a chief and he seven and he got up and said, so I just want to be clear about how about this question of dead naming. And he said, what's, what's that? And he said, well, so you mentioned that if I commit dead naming, then that's something where I can get written up and punished over. So if a guy that I've worked with for 10 years, 15 years comes in one week and says, I have to call him a different name than I've called him for the last 15 years and I slip up. Now I'm the one getting rid up. Now my career is on the line. If I do that, is that, is that what you're telling? And you could tell like he wasn't, he wasn't coming at it from a perspective of like, like a political perspective of yelling at him. He was just saying, I don't understand how that's possible. I don't know how am I supposed to protect myself from doing that? That that seems like an impossible standard. And the commander said, well, that's the, that's the directive that's been given. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, well, that's like, what is it? What's the greatest, you know, one of the greatest military movies ever, which stand, or, gosh, you know what I'm talking about with a guy? It's a platoon where the guy shoots himself and then he shoots his commander. You don't know what I'm talking about. Full metal jacket. Yes. And in that one, it's kind of in the sense for like, instead of punishing the big fat guy for not losing weight, they punished everybody else. But, but I want to make this point when you said earlier about foreign country, foreign countries recruiting our service members. But it's, it's exactly what they do in the NFL. It's like when the Dallas Cowboys, they go get some scrub off the New York Giants before they play them. So they can get inside information. So you're talking about the national security. That's a big deal. I mean, you know, people think this is like, you know, joke, but, but when we talk about national security and it also just pisses me off because you look at the Biden's and I'm not trying to just speak in cliches, but they literally just keep classified documents and sell in these probably classified documents. Don't really have, you know, they're probably not trying to start to get them and also know, Republic's going to crash. But still, they literally give this out for influence. So I don't even know if we have much government security anymore with all this espionage going on. No, not really. Because again, like I said, it's in you, you got like 20 year old, 21 year old gamers going on discord and leaking documents that tell us the actual truth about what's going on in Ukraine as opposed to, I don't know, the, the journalists and the Washington Post and the New York Times who are supposedly supposed to be doing that, but it turns out they're not doing any of it. And it's like a 20 year old kid. So we're going to arrest him and we're going to go after him and turn him into a whole thing when all he did was go to a bunch of guys that he played video games with and said, Hey man, they're lying to us about the war. And I've got the receipts and you could tell that he didn't really know what he was supposed to do with it. But, you know, and I see even to your point, there's like bipartisan response that all this kids evil. He's a traitor. We've got a smear him. He's a Russian. He's an insult. He's all these things when you notice that if you compare that to like a Vin Min or Daniel Ellsberg or the Watergate papers that when something is a leak, right, when something is a leak that they want, they get called a whistleblower and they get movies made out of them and they get TV shows and everybody's supposed to love them. But if you're someone who posts who who puts out something like Julian Assange, Oh, no, now you're now you're evil. You're probably a Russian agent. We don't have any evidence of that, but you're you're definitely a Russian agent. Yeah, I mean, you know, they call us not that I'm Q and on, but you know, there's just as much blue and on as Q and on the last one there. You know, weird conspiracies, you know, and I don't know, Jackie, it's kind of it's kind of a weird situation that we find ourselves in where this war in Ukraine, like it's like kind of Captain obvious that we know that we shouldn't even be there that I think at the beginning of this war, you know, if they just would have kept the Don Vas region autonomous and and, you know, I'm just I'm just saying normal people could have solved this problem, but because we want to have the war there, of course, government gets mad when they can expose that we know that this is a losing fight. You're going to continue to give them resources because we can wander money through it or we can just build up the Raytheon and Hallibur. And so I don't know, it's a little frustrating that we even have the evidence that the war is a joke. And then you see the response from the military. You see the response from the law enforcement, how they came on them. If it wasn't a big deal, if these documents were all fake, they just should have done like nothing or tried to sweep it under the rug. But they had it on live TV. People come into my house like they did that to send the message and it really doesn't send a great message. It kind of sends a message of dysfunction more than anything. Well, right. And so it's basically like this and I'm chat about this with Aaron Beatty where it's they've gotten to the point where this regime has totally, they used to have the power of soft power. So they used to have the ability, like you and I were talking about, the Hollywood used to be the end all be all the mainstream media, the establishment. They could set public opinion. They could set the narrative. And I actually remember this since we're talking about shows and insecure media guys, I was going to say, I remember that in the post 9 11 era, in that like era when Jack Bauer dominated the TV networks, that if you went to conservatives, they would tell you that like every Muslim they knew was planning to blow up the United States and you thought Al Qaeda was down the street, you know, for every, every, every time you saw someone who wasn't Christian. And by the way, I'm not saying that that doesn't mean there weren't sympathies or anything like that. But what I'm saying is it was this massive media push to make you think that Al Qaeda was everywhere. And that's why we had to send so many soldiers to Iraq and so many soldiers to Afghanistan, because God forbid they get here something like Jack Bauer come and this was everywhere. And so many people bought into this for so many years and you go back and look at it. And it's like, oh, so actually we can just beat them over there and then like trumpet in like three weeks. And then that just goes away. And like that doesn't exist anymore. And it's a question of so they've lost that soft power because people can see what's going on for real now. We've got Twitter, we've got real time engagement, we've got people with cell phones everywhere. They completely lost that soft power. So all they have left is hard power. All they have left are handcuffs and guns and helicopters and all the rest. Well, what you said, it goes back to your best friend, John Stewart, who even said that today on his show that if he was trying to speak out against the war in Iraq, they would have said that it was disinformation. So talk about lockstep because you're talking about how now Twitter and this new digital media agent, we can get news way faster. They had us in such lockstep. And this what I talk about and I make this point a lot. When you think about 9-11, you think about the pandemic, now you and I are so old, even though we're not that old, like there's kids born now. They don't even have no idea about 9-11. But my point is I try to tell them after 9-11 as a country, we came together. As a matter of fact, talk about globalism, new world order. That was probably we were a new world order there because every country was behind America. We had sympathy from everyone. It was actually kind of bucolic in a weird way. I mean, if you kind of remember it, I remember the football players with the flags and it didn't matter if you were left or right, we're all came together. And they riled us together to go after this fake enemy that was quote unquote, Muslim people when really Muslim people that aren't radical is over. They're very docile, very calm people. I'm just, you know, I'm just traditionally. But also socially conservative. That's what I'm saying, very conservative and very, you know, family values. So, so my point is like we created this boogeyman that the mainstream media worked together and my dad was scared. You were scared. I was scared. People are like, you go to a concert, you're going to get blown up. If you get on the airplane, you're going to get blown up. So that means take off your shoes. We're still taking our shoes off. Yeah, but what I'm talking about, the media was so blatant. It was just like be scared and that. I mean, I don't know. I don't know if the media can ever have that cohesion anymore because of this digital media age where now their narrative breaks down pretty fast, but with his vaccine, they've been able to keep the narrative going. No, that's right. I mean, I mean, we like we're used to it. I went so far with it that I literally joined the military and went to Guantanamo Bay. And exactly. And I was serving down there and we were like, all right, we're going to get these guys, but it would always be like, okay, and then we're going to go. It's like, so who are we going after today? What's the plot? And they're like, oh, he got this guy and he's in Somalia or he's in Yemen or he's like, so are they about to attack the United States from Yemen? Like, is this warlord out of Somalia, like about to come to the United States and do something? Cause that's, you know, that's, that's what we were told, like fight them over hair, so we'll fight them here. Like, well, no, not really. It's like, okay, so couldn't we, I don't know, call up the Saudis and have them deal with it or just like let them know what the intel is. You know, by the way, like, I want people to be clear, like, I'm all for locking up actual terrorists. You go right ahead. Of course. I have no problem whatsoever with that. You know, again, like I literally served at Guantanamo Bay. Um, but, you know, it's at the same time, it's, it's, you can't take that and say, okay, these guys were nuts, but that means that we have to, we have to structure our entire life around that and then go start invading countries and making more enemies, which is what we did. And by the way, to John Stewart, you know, saying that, um, you know, okay, John, are you going to come out and then speak the truth about Ukraine, which is going on right now? See, that's the thing is they'll say, Oh, they're a lot about Ukraine. The light about Afghanistan is light about Vietnam. They light about, you know, whatever in the past. So could they be lying about Ukraine? Oh, that's disinformation. No. Exactly right. How is the left? They were just occupying Wall Street in 2008 and talking about how they hate the big banks and hate the corporations. And now these people love Raytheon. They love Halberd and Michael Moore. Made a documentary bashing it. And now he loves, you know, the war in Ukraine. So it's just, it's very weird that they've been able to create this like new narrative where we just got to keep on going into pointless wars. But to, to what you said is how you were basically motivated to go and serve in the United States military because of what happened. Look at guys like Pat Tillman, who had a, you know, $50 million or $40 million, you know, don't quote me on it, but it'd be a multi million dollar contract with Arizona Cardinals and gave that up and then died by friendly fire. So it's just like, you know, we were kind of sold. Yeah, we say lied about for sure. And you know, his wife, I mean, let's get a conspiratorial put on the tinful hat. And she's actually spoken out about this, but that she was sent multiple letters saying that he was disenfranchising that they didn't have a clear objective. It wasn't even really anti war stuff. Like the letters came out and it was why I just showed the letters and they're not even really, but they kind of kept it secret. And they weren't even like that. It was that map, but he was like no clear objective. And they've kind of kept it secret. Like the NFL's never really talked about it. So they just think it's weird that he started to feel really disenfranchised with it before. And in his family, actually thinks that, you know, something, you know, nefarious may have happened. So it's just, it's just weird. I mean, I did. I'm not even trying to, I love controversies. You know, I'm a nut job like that, but I'm talking about more of the bigger problem. It's sad. What is it? This is what you say with a problem that they had to make go away. They just make it go away, just make the whole thing go away. Yeah. Well, this, this is like how it works. It's like Mussolini or Hitler. I hate to quote them, but they say like one death is a tragedy. A million deaths is a statistic. And that's kind of like what this is. It's like we kind of just like whitewash of all the millions of people that died in the Middle East. You know, we don't even really the fact that we're blowing up weddings and, you know, you know, Afghani funerals. It's just really kind of sad that we don't even care. And how do we care? Like, how do we care when we find out that something's not safe and effective? How do we like go back and rectify it? I don't know if there's a way to rectify. I guess just put it in the memory. I'm going to the next thing. Yeah. But I got to ask you, I got to ask you, you know, because we've been to our, like our last segment here, I got to ask you, you know, why, so, you know, this trans genocide that's been going on. So you are obviously the leader of the trans genocide. The Alex sign death squads have been marching up and down the United States, left and right, the, you know, the razor wire that you've been erecting. Why did you launch the trans genocide and how do you see it going? We're as of right now. You know, it's so funny, Jack. I, yeah, I love the, I love the joke, but I was talking to, not trying to name drop it. I was talking to Benny Johnson about this. And he was like, Alex, you were, you were on the forefront of exposing a lot of these dragger kids to pride events. And that was the summer where they got really emboldened and they started putting on the flyer, like all ages welcome, drag your kids, like all this kids up. But this is what, this is what the gods honest truth, where I feel kind of guilty now because of these, these restaurants, see how much clout they get, even though they get a lot of hate, even though in some places like Florida and Texas, they're getting investigated. Now these basically these gay friendly venues are just saying it's all ages invited just to get the clout just to get the people like me to protest against it. That's what's happening here in Texas. Like a marketing strategy. It's a marketing strategy. It's a marketing strategy. I'm sorry. I'm yelling. That's what makes you mad. It's like they're using little kids using like the sexualizing of little kids to create drama. So you go to their brewery and buy beer. And the worst, the worst of it all is that a parent will actually take their kid there and I see it all the time. But this is the thing that I'm not talking about. Of course they're crazy parents. But what I've noticed when I see this, I don't see a lot of nuclear families. It's oftentimes like two guys or two girls. Sometimes it's, it's oftentimes a couple and they break up. They'll transition their child to spite their ex husband or ex wife or somehow to get back. And then I see that with Jeff Younger, who his wife is transitioning one of their twins. And I see that over and over and over again, it was like, it's almost like lunch has been by proxy. They're purposely making their kids sick to get back at somebody else because there's no logical reason that you'd ever tell a child that they're born in the wrong body. You just can't. I mean, you can maybe it'd be hard to convince an adult, like you're born the wrong body. I'm an adult. I do that one, but a child, a kid can't get a tattoo. You're not born in the right. So the thing is like, like, like, so my son is four. He's going on five, be five and a couple of weeks here for this coming up. And at this age, he's so impressionable. And like, it's not just impressionable. It's because he wants to impress mom and dad. He loves when he's able to show, like, look, I was able to ride my bike by myself. I was able to like, I made my bed. Um, I figured out the puzzle or the game, whatever it is, right? Whatever it is. I was able to do it by myself. He loves to be able to impress us and to, and to make us happy, right? Um, look what I did. He's very proud of that. So if I start telling him that it's going to make me happy, if he plays with these toys and not those toys, then, and if I use that influence that I have over him in an undo way, like you say, much out of my proxy, then it wouldn't be hard for me. And I, you know, if you watch this years later, I'm sorry, but it is on, but it wouldn't be hard for me to start doing that because when you're at that age, it's, it's like, you like these skulls full of mush. And what's funny to me though is like, he came in, you know, uh, tie and I were watching a movie the other day, like at, at night, and he came in and could see a bedroom or something and we're watching, and we were watching John Wick and he comes in and he's like, what's that? And so that's John Wick. And then she goes, don't let him watch that. And I said, no, he can watch some. And, and he came in and he loved it. He was like, this is the coolest thing I've ever seen. Look at him fighting those guys, look at him beating those guys up. This is awesome. And when you're that age and you see an action movie and you're a little boy, and it's not like I told him that he should love that stuff or be into that stuff. He's into it because he's a dude and he's got dude jeans and that's the kind of stuff we love. I knew he feel the exact same way if I put on like, I don't know, fast, what are those like action Michael Bay, Fast and Furious, you know, go down the list, any of the Transformers movies where, you know, Michael Bay always says, like, I'm making these for 12 year old boys. I'm not trying to make like cinema verite or whatever here. This is these are made for little kids and they love them. And I'm saying that's not something that I pushed on him. That's something that he has because dirt to dirt. He was born that way. Yeah. And to your point, this is another thing. If if it's if you're a girl and you like John Wick movies, that doesn't mean you're a boy. You know what I mean? No, I'm not saying you're saying that, but that's it. The good movie. Yes. Kind of. Yeah. Or what I'm saying is there's some kind of girls that are tomboys. Like I remember Megan Summerville girl. I played. She was awesome at basketball. She was one of her better high school basketball players when she was really young. She could sometimes beat the guys. She never beat me, but we never played that much. But I'm just saying she was just physically a little more gifted, but she wasn't a lesbian. And then we're saying, Oh, you're transgender because she was really good at basketball at a young age. So it's just kind of weird how like it's OK for these kids to, you know, I guess, you know, go towards what they're passionate, but these parents are, you know, they're pushing them. These kids aren't naturally going, you know, to what they want. It's these parents that are manufacturing like you so that they can get approval. You know, these kids want to do for the same thing as my dad. I want to do whatever you wanted me to do because I want approval of my parents. But this one's good. This one goes back to the real problem of society today. And it's in BLM's manuscripts or in their, you know, manifesto. It's the denuclearization of the cohesive family. The fact that we are so separated, the fact that they want us, you know, raised by single mom who's struggling, who's in debt. So you can just go to school and be basically a ward of the state. So that's the big problem is that these kids don't have an apparent to even try to get approval from. So then you really don't have any structure. So it's crazy. So much of it is fatherless behavior, so much of it is fatherless behavior. And we actually know through just archaeological findings that the nuclear family, OK, mom, dad, kids is probably the oldest institution on the planet that we actually have evidence of. It predates Christianity. It predates governments. It predates everything. It predates towns and villages. When you were living, when humans were living in the caves, when the Neanderthals and the, you know, the chromagnes were getting it on, you know, in Europe, et cetera, that they lived in families and they lived together. And we found evidence of this. So you're literally talking about something that has worked for tens of thousands of years. And yet you get these people come on and say, you know what, let's try something a little bit different. Let's try mixing it up and see what we can do here. Let's try changing around things that should be immutable. And it's like, yeah, just because we have the technology to cut things off and twist things around, you see, I ended up doing the forearm stuff, man, that they're doing out there. And they're saying that's empowering. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. No, these are bad, bad moves. And we had a couple of the, um, the D transition activists on Allea London and Chloe Cole. They've talked about how just just horrific the experience was for them because they're messing with your head, especially when they took close parents. Check, they took close parents. She was going to kill herself if they did. And she, she came on here and so there was a point in that interview where. I wanted to ask the question from the position of a parent because it's hardwired. I think of everything as a parent. Like I'm terrified that happened to my kid, you know? And I said, but how could parents ever go along and I asked her the question. And I said, you know, we were talking about it with the producers here. And I said, I said, we'll see if I can get her to like on that track, you know, I'm not going to like open up with it, right? But I got her and she was talking about when she was in high school and she felt like she didn't fit in. And it's like, yeah, nobody feels like they fit it in high school. Unless you're like top of the food chain, everybody feels awkward in high school. But usually you don't start not attacking her, but like usually you don't start like undergoing surgery because of it. Usually you just go to like hot topic and, you know, to die your hair or something. You're not like committing, you know, permanent fraud. But then again, it's also because the doctors were doing that and telling her that she needed to do that. Then I said, well, how did the parents go? And they said, well, my parents were told that I was going to kill myself. And I got to tell you, you know, as a parent, that's that's the scariest possible thing you could ever hear of. Your child being a danger. Your child may not make it out of something. And it's like what would you. And so the question that becomes what would you what would you do? And they know this. What would you do or would you be willing to do to save your kid's life? And you're like, yeah, I'd rather my kid have a mastectomy than be dead. But I mean, it's just that's so evil. And then we even we even have them on. You're evil. Yeah. Well, billboard Chris, you know, he got it. He exposed that video from Boston Children's Hospital where they said that they liked gender dysphoria because once they get an early diagnosis, they have a patient for life. So I mean, if you can't see the amount of pediatric gender reassignment clinics that have opened up from 1950 to today, I mean, there was like zero in 1950. As a matter of fact, the only reason any of these surgeries or hormones actually exist. And I remember learning this my sophomore year of college in a sociology class, but they taught us about who's a gender studies class. Of course, we learned about trans and all that stuff. But they told us about what is called some people were born intersex or they're, you know, they're gendelles or, you know, some sort of deformity with their gendelles. And oftentimes these people usually can't, you know, procreate. They don't have reproductive organs because they have some sort of malfunction. So the families would be put in a tough situation back. This would happen in the 50s, 60s or whatever. Very rarely. I mean, very rarely. I mean, point zero, zero, zero, zero, one out of it. Yeah. This is not like some widespread. Yeah. This is yeah. This is not a common thing. This is almost like the medical books. Like a vestigial tail or something. Exactly. Or whatever. Yeah. They still have their tailors. You know, sometimes people were born seven fingers. They have to get a removed or something. It's just very rare. It's kind of like people don't know that you actually have web feed. Yes, I do have a big, but that's what made me swim faster. And that's why I'm trying to compete against the women. But that's neither here nor there. It's not about my trans swimming. Oh, what was I just talking about? Now, they got me a side tracks with the trans swimming. Yeah, the intersect. Sorry. So the reason why these clinics and the science exist is because there are a very small amount of people that needed like the gender reassignment surgery or they would actually give them hormones so that as early as possible. So in this doctrine in these books, that was like the medical machine as early as possible to, you know, get the baby acclimated to a shooter. So they taken that they like extrapolated this thing, which was in a way, maybe based on science that somebody's born intersected, be good for them to identify as their sex or their, but now they've taken that. Well, now it's basically they're just giving me a mastectomy and bottom surgery to any 16 year old that's willing to do it, basically. Right. And so, so right. And they're normalizing this. They do this, by the way, they do the same thing with so many things in history where they'll take something and they'll say, Hey, there was this horrible incident that took place like in the south or in the past or colonial, whatever it was. And they'll act like that was the norm. And then they're teaching kids this and saying, Oh, this is the norm throughout all of time. And so if you want to demonize something or if you want to normalize something, you make it look as that if that one incident, which, OK, admittedly, you may have been bad, but acting is if that's the total norm for everything that's going on right now. We saw this in this, this situation out in Kansas City, the same thing where they play with statistics because they blow up one thing where they'll say, OK, here's a here's like an 84 year old man and there was a black kid who came to his home and we don't know exactly what happened, but there was a shooting that occurred and then it's everywhere. It's the only thing to see if President Biden's getting involved, all this stuff's happening. But if you look at the actual data, you can see this is like such an it's an outlier to an outlier. It's a side show, a side show. And you are the ones who are amplifying it and making it exist as if this is some normal behavior when it's obviously just a horrific like series of mistakes that took place. And at the same time in upstate New York, the very same day or at least the same weekend, the same thing happened to a white girl who was up with her friends and a white guy. And they pulled into his driveway and it was like out in the woods and they thought it was a, you know, some party house, but it wasn't. And he shot it with a shotgun and killed her. And yet that story, that's not anywhere. You know, a couple of clicks on the websites, but Joe Biden's not calling them up. That's not wall to wall coverage on CNN. No, so it's the same trick that's so smart that you brought that up because what they do is they take a statistical outlier and they act as and they amplify it to the point where people think it's normal. Yeah, that's exactly what they do. They want to say Bill Gates, his favorite book, how to lie with statistics, basically. I mean, that's what they can do. They can use numbers and they can formulate any hypothesis and say, but this is really what it comes down to. And you know this to kind of wrap things up. The problem is it's like problem reaction solution. Like the solution is for these people to, you know, the new world or whatever, you know, whatever the end plan is. And so they, they, they have to make us react a certain way. They have to use fear. And that's the problem. That's what gets him mad is that they use this fear, what I call trauma-based mind control to scare us into compliance. And that's what happened during the pandemic. And that's what's going to happen with this climate change. Now all these climate change activists, like, dude, you don't care about it. And if these polar ice caps are melted, why is Bill Gates and Barack Obama buying beachhouses? They're all full of crap. Yeah, I would even, I saw some people pointing out they're like, what's the carbon footprint of SpaceX that, you know, Tesla's supposed to be Tesla's, but the, and I don't say that as an attack or whatever, but, you know, Tesla's supposed to be over helping climate change, but then you see SpaceX and, you know, 33 massive. And I think it's great. I think SpaceX is wonderful. I think we need human education and patience. But where's the, what I'm saying, doesn't matter. We're not even the most pollutant country. You know what I'm saying? It's not if this climate stuff makes sense. It's what I'm saying. I'm not even worried about John Kerry in a private jet. I'm not worried about Elon Musk, Roggis. I don't really think that's making the ozone layer thinner. And that, you know what I'm saying? They have to use fear. They have to make a state that we're going to have this apocalyptic event. And actually, as a matter of fact, I got to write my monologue for my show tonight. And I guess I'll kind of run a bio. I was thinking about talking about it. Yeah, yeah. It's a lot of people talking this morning. Well, I was thinking people want the apocalypse. Jack, when we were young, when we watched every movie, we were talking about movies, you can wrap up this whole thing. And in a way, it can also be based biblically because everybody likes revelation. Everybody reads Genesis and Revelation in the Bible. So it's like, we kind of want this apocalypse. By the way, Greek word for revelation is apocalypse. That's when you're saying apocalypse, you're saying the word revelation in Greek. And so it's kind of this weird thing. It's like the Christian right wants it. But then like the left kind of wants apocalypse too. They want to see everybody burn and like they love the pandemic. So it's kind of this weird thing. It's like I want I want it. And I'm not a preacher. I'm not a role model. Always say this to the opposite of me. I'm an idiot, but it's like we got to have, I guess, more gratitude instead of like hoping for the end, you know, it's like we almost want this big kaboom and we want like everything to fall and with this, you know, not civil war. We don't want to, but you know what I'm saying? We want the bug. Want to have. We want like a half. And this is the point that I was trying to make to it. And this is my problem with crypto, bros. I have a little bit of crypto, but all the people that are in crypto, I'm not really hating on you, but you want our money system to collapse. I don't want money system to collapse. You know what that's going to do to so many people like like working class people and those families, people who are living paycheck to paycheck, they're done. They're done if the US dollar collapse is done. And it's like, and what, you know, you're just going to throw some NGA through the end you my bro, N GMI, your kids are starving. N GMI like, nah, man, that's not good. But people want this though, Jack. People want this. And I do want some change, but I don't want the change to happen because the world collapses. I still believe in, you know, I still have American pride. I still like want to help people. Well, I still want to help you. I think like the idea that I don't want to be a socialist country, but the idea that we have social services or want to help people, that's great. I actually am not against that, but let's just not waste that money in the Ukraine. Let's help American citizens. Let's help veterans. Like, let's help families that are struggling. Let's help single moms instead of people that don't need it. Like no offense that is legal, illegal immigrants, but they come here and unless I see you see Camilla Harris's house, there's 20 illegal immigrants there. They're like, Oh my God, this is the crazy thing. I'm in Dallas, Texas, Jack. Every day, Bob and Lake, it's near the airport. I see 20, 30, you know, they're like El Salvadorian or something. They have their mask on. They have like a new Walmart shirt. You can just tell they got here and they're walking around like, where do I go? So I'm saying these people are getting more help. They're getting free t-shirts. They're getting free cell phones. Help some of these people that are actually born here, you know, and I'm not saying, I'm anti-immigration, but let's just try to reallocate some of our, you know, everybody needs a vaccine to come into this country. It's killed our tourism in a lot of places because these European tourists will come through and a lot of money because we have a vaccine mandate. You know, I'm just saying, but these illegal immigrants, they don't have to get vaccinated. So I just want rules for the same for everyone. I don't want it to to your justice system. It's as simple as that. Alex Stein, where can people go to follow you, my friend? OK, guys, please watch my new show, Prime Time with Alex Stein. It's like Tucker Carlson on acid. And when you watch it, do the opposite. Like I said, Jack's serious. Jack has like, you know, he's a vet. He has a real world experience. So you can take his opinion. You can take, you know, with what he says is going to be factual. True. When you watch my show, anything goes, I'm going insane for the Ukraine. So my show is not informational at all. It's not it's actually going to make you dumber. So if you're, if you're, if you're, it kind of stressed out, you're getting too much real drama and real news, come watch some fake news, not a CNN, but here at the blaze with Prime Time with Alex Stein. Spread misinformation with Alex Stein. Alex Stein, always a pleasure, my friend. Thanks, Jack. Talk to you soon. All right. Talk to me. Ladies and gentlemen, as always, you have my permission, lay short."
