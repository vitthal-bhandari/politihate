    "text": " Welcome. Welcome to Fearless with Jason Whidlock. I am Jason Whidlock, your host. Happy Wednesday. It's hump day. It's Tennessee Harmony Day. It's a great day to be in my neighborhood and watching this show. We're going to have a fantastic show. Steve Kim should be going to show. We're going to join me. Dave Shannon and Anthony Walker will be here for some Tennessee Harmony. We're going to start with the Korean Co-Sail and we'll also start with you guys pounding that like button on YouTube and helping us beat the algorithm. If you're listening over Apple, give us that five star review as we fight that algorithm. I'm going to have a fire starter, but I'm going to do it after Steve Kim joins the program. And so without further ado, let's roll out two Los Angeles and bring in the Korean Co-Sail as we talk a little sports and a little bit about Zion Williamson, who has made some statements and has a about an issue and has problems with an issue that I share with him. The lack of fork control and Zion has more money than me, but shares the same problem. He believes that too much money makes it harder to diet. I agree with Zion on that. Let's play the clip and then we'll bring Steve Kim in to discuss it. Isn't hard to diet at your age? Uh, she's, be honest. Since you, I'll be real. There are times when I will say that man actually hard. It's hard man, like, you 20, 22, got a lot of money. You feel like all the money in the world, man? It is hard, but I'm at that point now where because of certain things, I'm putting back like the wisdom around me, much of the... Like, I want to say older because they too fast to live. And I'm just putting people around me with wisdom, putting me on games and certain things and just go from there. What he's basically saying is, hey, I've made it. I went through a year at Duke, high school career and got overrun with money as soon as I hit the NBA. I've made it. What other purpose? What do I have left to accomplish? And so it's hard to be motivated and disciplined because I've made it and it almost doesn't matter what I do from here. I've pocketed it from my shoe contracts and other endorsements and from the NBA. Maybe he's already made 40, 50 million bucks and feels like he's made it. And so he's just not that motivated. Steve, what do you think Zion's trying to convey here about his lack of discipline with the fork? Well, first of all, good Wednesday to you. And again, I love the way you look out for the fans by bringing me on as fast as possible. I like that. Again, your Yelp review should be a five stars today. I completely disagree and disavow with this young man. For him to insinuate that it's easier or it's more difficult to eat healthy when you're rich or have that status. That's completely untrue. The reason why certain segments of the population are grossly overweight is because they can only afford junk food and things that are not good for them. It is more expensive and more inconvenient if you do not have money to eat healthy. Think about Zion Williamson. His body is made for business. He's an athlete. So you got to make sure that you invest into your business. This guy could literally hire three different chefs for every meal of the day, breakfast, lunch and dinner. Right? You could have a breakfast guy, a lunch guy, a snack guy, a late night guy, a dinner guy, and it would be a tax write off. You talk to people that have money or don't have money or been in both situations that they will tell you it's much easier to eat healthy because of your options economically when you have money. Seriously, and if you actually go to a good restaurant that has healthy meals, they are probably a little bit more expensive than your average Burger King or McDonald's. Give me a break. This guy, I hate to say this and I don't want to write him off, but he's going to go down. And it seems like in the Stanley Roberts, John Hot Plate Williams, a lexicon of wasted ability of guys who just simply don't have the discipline to make this work. See, discipline is obviously an issue, but I just don't think being a great player is that high of a priority for Zion. That's what he's really saying is like, Hey man, there's a lot of money for being a professional athlete. I got a lot of money. And again, he says it feels like it's an endless supply of money and it should feel that way at 22, 23 years old because you don't really understand money at that point. And so what he's saying is like being a great basketball player, that was never really my agenda. I did it because I was good. I hit the genetics lottery. I was tall and athletic. This was going to be a way for me to get a lot of money, but the actual work and the actual desire to be a great player is not really a priority for Zion. And so everybody else is like, Hey man, take advantage of this potential that you have to be a great basketball player. But that's just not that important to him. And it's not as important as satisfying his taste buds and his desire to eat. Well, there's a reason why and Herman Edwards used to tell a story that when they went to the NFL combine when he was on a staff and they bring in these players who were going to make millions of dollars. He would just ask him one question. Hey son, you love football. And if he didn't like the way that kid reacted or his face, no, not this guy, not for us. We don't care how much talent he asked because if he does not have the drive to play this game of football and just to be a pro, forget the passion to be a pro. We're not giving him millions of dollars. You just cannot trust him. And I think that formula probably works across the board. If you stick with it. By the way, in relation to Zion's discipline, it's not only his diet discipline. That's an issue. Okay, let's put it that way because he has an appetite for other things. Now with that said, pleasure. He has an appetite for pleasure. Food and sex are the greatest pleasure tools that, you know, that many people. Yeah, you know what the pump is on it. He's partaking in both in the wrong places. McDonald's and Mariah, not good. Not good. Okay, so here's what he needs to do. We're going to salvage his professional reputation. He needs to quit basketball and there needs to be a challenger to Joey Chestnut. Since this young man loves to eat and he wants to be gluttonous, someone out there needs to break the dynasty of Joey Chestnut. Okay, this is getting real repetitive on 4th of July. Since our my fellow Crouching Tiger, Kobayashi got banned or something. We got, we got to break this Joey Chestnut dynasty. It's getting boring. It's getting repetitive. Die on, start training for next 4th of July. Since you've taken me there. Yes. You've taken me there. You're going to force me to have an opinion on the hot dog eating contest. Yes. Which I believe is one of the biggest scams in all of sports. They're not, it's not a hot dog eating contest. They're not eating hot dogs in the bun with ketchup and mustard on it. They're stuffing hot dogs in their mouth. They're dumping, dipping buns in water and shoving it down their throat. If they wanted to make that contest more enjoyable and more televisable, make them eat a real hot dog in between a bun with mustard on it and relish and ketchup if they want. Make them, make them do that. Make them get messy. That would be an interesting contest. Well, come on. These guys are trying to watch their wake. I can't let them go and add carbs to this old thing. I went, look, going back to Zion Williamson. This is one of the pratfalls. And I know you've talked about this. The difference between the NFL and the NBA in terms of collective bargaining agreement specifically as it relates to guaranteed contracts and money. This is what happens when you tell somebody, hey, that 180 million dollars, whether you play another game or not, and whether you want to load management 30 games or three, you're getting your money. Jason, what do you think was going to happen? What do you think was going to happen? And if I'm a team that hears that and I'm kind of in discussions with New Orleans to, hey, do we take a chance on Zion? I think we can rehabilitate him. He can lose 30 pounds. He could be that guy. We all thought that interview right there. I tell my GM. Nope. Nope. Steve, here's the thing. I don't think Zion is unique among athletes in the NBA or the NFL or even Major League Baseball or any of these sports. I think the overwhelming majority of them, especially in the NBA and the NFL, they play it because they have the talent and the genetic gift. There's only a handful of them that play it because they absolutely love the game and want to do it. Zion is just more transparent and his lack of love for the game is just more obvious, but I don't think he's remotely unique. He's got a unique problem with his gluttony. Most athletes don't have that, but his lack of desire and passion for the game, I think is quite common among NFL and NBA players. I don't disagree with you, but let me just say this. What I expect from an athlete is not passion. I expect professionalism. And what does that word mean? That word means doing something when you don't want to do it because there's an obligation. Doesn't matter if you're sick or you have mental issues. You just go out there and do it because you signed that contract. Think about it, Jason. Would you rather have a player that's passionate and loves the game and would play it for free and gives you 12 points and four rebounds a game or a guy that just says, you know, basketball is just an occupation for me. I do it because I'm good at it, but he puts up 30 and 15. I mean, again, as a fan, and this is what bothers me about load management. I don't care if you love the game or not, but if you're giving me a great show as a fan, if I invest my time into watching you on television or actually going out to the game and you give me an amazing memory. And that was the great thing about Michael Jordan, I believe. There came a point where Michael got worn down by being Michael, just consistently being under the microscope and you could see it in the way he talked and dealt with people. And what I, and one thing I've noticed about Michael and studying his game and watching various clips, there could be a relatively meaningless game in the middle of January where the dog day said in an adult room in Indianapolis or some other city that's not really a rival. But he took that that tact from Joe DiMaggio. Joe DiMaggio once said, as a player, I had to understand one thing. There's somebody in those stands who's never seen me before. And this will be the one time ever seeing me. I have an obligation to my name and to this franchise and to the game. Michael Jordan did that. I think a lot of games that really didn't mean much. And this guy is putting on a show. And look, he could have played 36 rounds of holes of golf the night before, been out gambling, doing whatever. But when that ball was tipped, he understand I'm Michael Jordan. I have an obligation to myself, the Bulls, and the game. And again, you're right, but there's not a lot of Michael Jordan's anymore. Well, I wouldn't even say anymore. Even during his era, Mike, Magic, Larry, Isaiah, these guys are all unique. But over, and one of the reasons why Jordan would get so frustrated with his teammates is because they couldn't match his passion for the game. And there's guys that literally have just as much physical talent as Michael Jordan. They just didn't care as much about playing the game. They like cocaine. They like strippers and whores. They like drinking Zion's case. He likes eating. And it's not that Mike, because I don't know Mike that well, maybe he likes some of those things. But not to the point of where it would cause him to be derelict in his duties as a basketball player, but many of these players. You know, I knew many NFL players who felt like they couldn't practice or play the game of football without being high. And that giving high was more important than being the best football player possible. And that's what separates a Deon Sanders from, let's say a guy like Dale Carter. I don't know if you remember Dale Carter from Tennessee that played cornerback for the Chiefs. Dale Carter had as much talent as anybody. Dude love cocaine. And I say that with respect for Dale Carter because my understanding now is, you know, he's turned his life over to Christ and he's a different person. But that dude would show up to practice high on cocaine and hung over all the time. Poor Dale Carter just try to enjoy his Wednesday and you just throw him under the bus. But Jason, this goes back to the profession. Okay, well anyway, Dale, you were a great Tennessee volunteer. My respect to you. But let's go back to the act of professionalism and what that means. Back in those days when I was still an avid NBA fan, as you were, I didn't watch a lot of games where I said, man, that guy dogged it. That guy didn't try that guy doesn't want. They all had to be out there. That's the problem with load management. You start to give these guys an out. It almost becomes excused. In fact, the whole thing about mental health is now being used, I believe as a crutch. Because I see it in boxing and that thing, it does not exist. But when you're allowed to just skirt your responsibilities, I think while I'm having mental issues, well, you can't even ask these guys, well, okay, are you going to your mental health facility? So all of this is tied in. It's not just one thing. But Jason, at least those guys who played in that era, if they did not love the game and didn't want to even pick up a basketball once their playoff series ended, I'm okay with it because for some reason, I'm not going to be able to get it. I'm not going to be able to play with it because for six, seven, eight months, they were professional. They played the game and they did their duty and they lived up to their contract. And for me as a fan, that's good enough for me. So, I'm going to make a repeat note, the U.S. Women's Soccer Star. Rapinoe made news recently saying that she sees trans women as real women and would welcome a trans woman on the U.S. women's soccer team. So, Raleigh James, the University of Kentucky Swimmer, they competed against Leah Thomas, William Leah Thomas, had some comments about this. Let's play Raleigh James. Well, not only is she just a high profile athlete, she's actually someone who fought for women in sports. She fought for equal pay. She fought for equal access, equal resources, all of those things in comparison to the women's U.S. national soccer team, to the men's. And now she is undermining her fight entirely. And notice how earlier this week she announced her retirement. So, she's done playing. This is a classic case of virtue signaling. She wants to be seen as kind. She wants to be seen as inclusive. But it is not inclusive what she's fighting for. It's actually exclusive. It's exclusive to the very female athlete who the women's sporting category was created to protect. And it's not kind to ask a girl to undress in front of a man in a locker room. That is the exact opposite of kind. Your thoughts on Megan Rapinoe. Well, first of all, Miss Gaines makes a great point. It's easy for Meg to say that she's retired. She doesn't have to deal with those ramifications or compete. A couple of months ago, I remember seeing some clip about a group of some club, their alumni. A bunch of older retired soccer players with dad bods beat our U.S. national team like 12 nothing or 15 nothing. So I have a solution for Ole Miss Rapinoe. Okay, let's have it. You know what I would do? I would just load up that whole U.S. women's soccer team with trans males. We'd be unbeatable because face it, our men's team were never going to win. I mean, we might get to the quarter finals and that's good enough. But let's load up the whole women's team with a bunch of transformers. Well, blank teams, 10 nothing will be a dynasty. That wish you really wants. I find Meg Rapinoe to be contemptible. I really do. But I think it's even worse that we give her a platform and we're supposed to pretend to take her seriously. Again, the paraphrase Logan Roy, she is not a serious person. She just isn't. It actually bothers me that we give her a platform and give her a megaphone to even say this stuff. But again, you want to have it your way. Let's just load up the team with every single roster spot given to a trans former and let's just blow out and dominate the rest of the world. Let's just have it your way. Look, I'm going to be succinct here and just summarize Megan Rapinoe just as honestly and as coldly as I can. She's an attention whore in the story. She says these things for attention. That's it. And she's not the only one. There's men that are attention whores as well. But that's all this is. And she's on her way out that she doesn't. She's not as newsworthy as she used to be. Everybody's kind of over her, you know, her and just the whole deal. And so, oh, here's the way I can get my name in the news cycle and I'll have something to talk about. She's addicted to attention. And in your right, we keep giving it to her. And so she'll keep saying stupid things. And there's another topic I'm far more interested in. Steve, the Fourth of July sparked rumors that Tom Brady and Kim Kardashian were flirting with each other at a Michael Rubin party. Michael Rubin, the billionaire owner, founder of Fanatics through a big Fourth of July white party. Every celebrity or star seemed to be there, including Tom Brady and Kim Kardashian. And people said they're firder with each other all night. And with Tom Brady and Kim Kardashian, would that be a good celebrity couple? First of all, I mean, that must have been a dent of decadence. One of those fancy white parties. I think everyone that attended and I think Joe Burrow. I'm like, Oh boy, I hope you're not getting caught up in that stuff. All that debauchery. I don't believe it. I don't believe these rumors. I don't want to believe. You know why? Let's be honest, Jason. Brady is not exactly Kardashian's type. He's a little pale, little suburban. You know, I mean, he's Davidson. Oh yeah, that weirdo. I know, but come on. That's not Tom. Tom, get yourself a nice Becky. Keep it simple. Keep it drunk. Get yourself a nice Latina. You know, come on, man. What? No, just kidding. Tom, you can do Tom. Tom is like that guy that is in the tax bracket for a nice luxury car. Right? I mean, a Bugatti or one of those fancy ones that I can't pronounce. I mean, I drive a Civic. I don't know anything about it. Tom, in a situation like yours, you don't go to Hertz and Ava's and get a used car with 375,000 miles on it. Get yourself out of this play audible. Call a timeout. But no, I'm not. No, no, Tom, don't do it. Don't do it. No, no. Do you not think if true, it would say something about Tom Brady that he's not, he's full blown celebrity, phony, materialistic, no morals, celebrity, just like everybody else? Just the fact he was at that party. And I think when I, I saw some footage of it, I said, this is a cult. This is a cultish group based on celebrity and status. And again, I don't want to go completely full blown all over stone here, but I have theories about gatherings like that. And did it make me kind of lose respect for Tom Brady? Not to be judgmental, but I'm going to be judgmental. Hell, yeah, I did. Yes, it really did. And when I saw Joe Burrow there, I'm like, Joe, you're better than this. You're better than, but I guess he's not. I guess he's not. And Tom Brady, look, you got yourself a freedom pass. I know I hate to put it that way, but you can upgrade. Your lease is over with the other one. Giselle, what's her face? She's rolling around doing jujitsu with her instructor. Do not go to Ava's or Hertz, man. I'm trying to help you. See, Belichick brought structure into his life. This is where Bill Belichick go to coach, man. This is the bad look, though. I'm with you on that. When I saw him there, I was like, you're not the guy we thought you were. It is, I become so negative towards celebrities that when this thing was popular over social media and everybody was showing who was there, I did make me go. So the 4th of July, would I rather be there with that group of celebrities or would I rather be partying with a group of my longtime friends and family members? And I, you know, people won't believe it, but yeah, I'd rather be with longtime friends and family members than a group of, you know, drunk, high, tatted up, narcissistic celebrities. And I'm sure some of those celebrities, good guys or girls individually, but, and maybe it's just because I've just become an old, fuddy, duddy or whatever, but I just, I wasn't sitting there jealous, like, oh, man, I wish, I wish I was at that party. I was sitting there like, there's a group of idiots that are all told what to think. That's just basically a summertime version of the Met Gala. You know, when we say, when I say people at the Met Gala and you're involved, I say, okay, you're questionable. You are questionable. I just think of you at that point. Yeah, you're not someone I'd want to hang out and drink a frosty cold one with. They're not normal people. They're not among us. They are elitist does not make them better than us. But you're right. And when I say current athletes doing this and these, these are some of the same guys that will complain now. About white supremacy, which is always interesting to me. You know, they complain about social justice about being down with the people. And then you go to an elitist gathering like this. I've, I've already questioned everything you said about that current agenda. Now it just really confirms what I thought all along. Steve, I saw you last night. I'm about to talk about this into a fire starter on this topic, but I saw you last night. Lingerine lurking in the Twitter spaces last night as we talked about Pearl Davis, Pearly Things, the queen of the Manosphere. And, and I felt like we made a mistake and should have gotten your opinion on Pearl and the conversation we were having last night. Was there something you wanted to chime in last night that you bit your tongue and held back? Well, no, I'm just doing some reconnaissance and this is what the thing about me. I could be a beige spot on a beige wall as colorful as I am. Couple things. Number one, I'm beginning to think on the Whitlock Mount Rushmore. There's Jeff George, Warren Central High, Filet-O-Fish, and now Pearly Things. My God, good grief. Crushing a lot. Geez, Jason, just get a room or something. The other thing is, I do respect her. I'm not someone that watches her a lot. There's other people and you know who they are that get my time on the internet specifically on YouTube. But what I do respect about that young lady, she does not succumb to white guilt. I love the fact she can get into a space or any type of form with a lot of different people and state as a white woman. No, I don't believe in this, this or that because I think a lot of people gerrymander their opinion. In other words, they state their opinion, but they don't give their full opinion because they want everyone to agree with them or nobody to bite back on them. One thing that I get a lot is, well, who are you as an Asian to talk about this, this or that? Easy, I'm Steve Kim. If I'm asked the question, I will give you my honest opinion. When you are white, black, Asian, Hispanic, Jewish, Christian, Protestant, 2 plus 2 is 4, and you should be always allowed to say the truth. Not my truth or your truth, just the truth. Poorly things, for better or worse, you do not have to agree with her, but she will state her unfiltered, unfettered opinion. And one of the greatest things that's happening or worse things in America, a lot of people are succumbing to white guilt and suppressing their own true thought. And I believe that's a sign of weakness. You do not have to agree with anything she says or everything, but that's her opinion and she should be allowed to have it. And one other thing, I saw a video from Tommy Sotomayor, Tommy doing a hell of a job. By the way, he jumped on. Now that was star studded. Great job, Tommy. You brought some life and excitement to that thing. Okay. Now. Did you hear Tommy's rant? That was great. That's Tommy. Tommy's going to do Tommy. Before he gets banned, he's going to go out as himself. But anyway, he did this review of Pearly's building this big compound on her father's or childhood home. She's going to bring her own studio set up. It's a whole compound and she did a tour. This thing is expansive. I mean, if the rent's not too bad, I might move into one of those rooms, by the way. But anyway, during this thing, there's a basket for it. Where is she building this? Where is she building what? Some sort of compound for studios and events. Yeah. Ask her about that. I know you'll be invited now. I mean, you're going to get one of the VIP things to her white party, right? So anyway, here's the thing that was impressive. So she's getting film. She's giving a tour of the studio, the room. She shot some baskets. She shot like 20 footers. She made like five in a row. I mean, I was like, she's got a good jump shot. I've got to give her credit. She can shoot the bass. She got skills. She can play. I like, you know what? Poorly, you're okay. You're okay. You're okay by me. So that's what I take. There's some 30 year old guy that should be smart and should go invest, put a seed inside of a pearly thing and start an MBA team. Wait, wait, wait. Yeah, but basically, it's interesting, the interview, you got to admit she was doing the swirl. You know, she had a black boy. She like brothers. That's why she's so bold. Yeah, she that's why she has no white guilt. Yeah. So by the way, so all the people that say that currently should not be speaking about certain things or certain cultures or races. I have a question. Do you hold yourself to the same standard? So you only talk about what, what is directly your race. That's that's my cause I get that a lot. Like who are you as an Asian to talk about us and now say, you know what? I'm an Asian that's get talked about anything. Here's the thing. You as another culture, you are free to have your opinion of Asian Americans. It's fine. It's absolutely fine. Will not bother me. I believe in the First Amendment. Thank you, Steve. Great job as always. We'll see you tomorrow. Stay tuned. I'm going to have a fire starter. Addressing pearly things here in a second.

It's me, Michelle, that's going to join me for my fire starter. That's... The Manosphere, a loose confederation of male anti-feminist internet content creator, loves Pearl Davis. She is our queen, our ally in the fight to save the patriarchy. She's a soldier in the coldest, longest running war in the history of the planet. A war that is climaxing as you listen to me talk. It's the gender war, the battle of the sexes, the matriarchy versus the patriarchy. A spat sparked by a disagreement over an apple in the garden has brought the world to the brink of collapse. We should not be surprised. The issues and conflicts we ignore or wish away are the very maladies that destroy us. We hyper-focus on racial, political and geographical conflict, falsely believing solving these disputes will bring us peace and order. We draw lines in the sand with conservatives and liberals between blacks and whites and among bordering nations. We're willing to die over race, politics and land encroachments. The planet long dispute between men and women forces us to compromise. Those compromises have led us where we are today. Men have been seduced into surrendering power and authority to women. The emotion and feelings of women rule Western civilization. This has created the Manosphere, an isolated passionate corner of the Internet where men grumble about their loss of dominion over the fish of the sea, the fall of the air and over everything that creepeth upon the earth. The matriarchy and its culture have rewritten the book of Genesis. Their rewrite warns against being fruitful, multiplying and replenishing the earth. Men no longer subdues the earth. Woman subdues man. In this climate, Pearl Davis is a tall glass of water in a feminist controlled desert. She's joined the Manosphere in discussing the most important issue facing mankind, the natural order of authority. The church is shied away from the topic or acquiesced to the feminist point of view. This topic goes much deeper than prominent evangelists such as Rick Warren ushering in in a egalitarian view on pastoral leadership. What are the consequences of women voting and joining the workforce? Have welfare and other government subsidies undermine male rulership and made America chaotic and vulnerable. As the country gone too far promoting the development of girls and neglected the development of boys. All of these issues and many more need to dominate the pool pit. They're mostly ignored and left to the Manosphere. Bold, polarizing and humorous Pearl Davis won the adoration of the Manosphere with a string of viral videos that proclaim the superiority of men and mock the delusion and boredom of modern women. What's not to love? Pearl tells men exactly what we want to hear. Women should admit to their husband, America should repeal the 19th amendment, women aren't as valuable as men, women should expect and accept that high value men will cheat. From her temporary home in London, the Chicago native is building an online empire that made one day rival Andrew Tate's. She has approximately 1.5 million YouTube subscribers. Her ranch arguing against women voting and their declining beauty and fertility in their 30s are adding thousands of Twitter followers daily. She's mastered the art of trick-green both conservative and liberal women. Yesterday, I interviewed Pearl on this show. It was my first interaction with the 6-foot-tall volleyball player turned internet influencer. We chatted for a little more than 30 minutes. I liked her. Later that evening, I participated in a Twitter spaces conversation for two hours that discussed the importance and authenticity of Pearl's meteoric rise to relevance. She meets Michelle, Lauren Chin, Isabelle Riley Moody participated in a nuanced conversation with myself, TJ Mo and men and women across the Twitterverse. The full day of discussing pearly things left me wondering if the well-intentioned influencer is more of an unwitting double agent than force for good. She stumbled into her role as a cheerleader for the Manosphere and outspoken critic of feminism. She studied finance and college. She launched her influencer career on TikTok posting videos about building a water slide in her family's backyard. She then made sarcastic videos interpreting raunchy rap music videos as the stereotypical suburban white girl. She had a simple goal. She wanted to earn enough money to move out of her parents' house. She achieved that goal when she leaned into being the female voice of the Manosphere, her innocent. Girl Next Door Charm mixed with natural conservative values made her unique and irresistible. She's surely temple parroting the talking points of Andrew Tate. I don't say that to dismiss her. I love Pearl. I find her entertaining and authentic. But I have to admit there is some danger to Pearl. My conversation last night on Twitter spaces helped me see the danger. While mocking the delusion of modern women, Pearl inadvertently condones the delusion of modern men. Make no mistake, the Manosphere is delusional. It delights in ridiculing the failures of women without recognizing their failures are a reflection of man's horrendous leadership. The Manosphere argues that the problem with the world is the fallen standards and morality of women. The truth is, it is man's fallen standards and morality that have ruined women and the world. The Manosphere wants women to fall in line, submit to the natural order of male leadership, while relieving men of the responsibility of falling in line and submitting to the natural order. The natural order is man follows God and woman follows man. The Manosphere rejects God's order of cleaving to one woman and avoiding adultery. It's one of the reasons we find Pearl irresistible. She repeats Kevin Samus' mantra that high-value men are going to be promiscuous and that women seeking high-achieving men should learn to accept that fact. The Manosphere believes it's natural for men to cheat and or be promiscuous. Well, it's equally natural for women to usurp authority for men. Should we allow that? We want women to slay their flawed instincts. The key to inspiring them to do that is for men to slay their flawed instincts. Pearl, like all of us, has much to learn. She needs a biblical understanding of the value of women. Men cannot reproduce and has little life purpose without women. I don't blame Pearl for her naive and misguided thoughts. I don't blame the Manosphere either. I blame the Church for not being as bold and courageous as Pearl and the Manosphere. That's my fire starter. I want to talk about this with Shamika Michelle. And then we're going to move into Tennessee Harmony and get a more biblical perspective on this feud dispute Cold War between men and women from Dave Shannon and Anthony Walker. Shamika, welcome back to the show. You did a great job last night on the Twitter spaces. We spent a lot of time yesterday interviewed Pearl on the show, talked about her last night for two hours. I thought you and Lauren Chen and Isabella Raleigh were amazing. Watching Pearl and interview and having that discussion last night, where do you stand now on Pearl for good or grifter? I think it depends on what we actually want. Somebody gave the term that I had never heard last night, trigger marketing. And so I definitely think she's good at that. People get on social media all day and give their opinion and no one really cares. You have to have a certain boldness. You have to have a certain ability to trigger people or to get people to notice you. I think she does very well with that. But it's like, what do you want to come from that? We talked about how there are certain people in the world that never want to see the race divide go away because they make a lot of money just keeping that division. If they constantly make black people feel like you're less than, you're oppressed, then these are money makers. So if there's a constant push of men and women are divided, men and women, don't get along. There's a war. Women are this. Men are that. There's going to be money in that. But what exactly do you want to come from that? Do you really want to see men and women come together just as people? Do you really want to see different races come together and there be no difference? We judge them on the content of their character? Or do you just want to have height and likes? And so for me, I don't know if I truly believe that there's a desire to see men and women come together. Like we always say inflammatory things. You know, I say a lot of inflammatory things, but I genuinely want to see women in a better position. I don't want women sitting around the house feeling like they are less than because they are housewives or because they are mothers. I know that when I was a young housewife, all of the women around me were either business owners or they worked. And there was no real support system for me to say you're doing the right thing being at home with your kids. This is what you should be doing. Instead, it was girl. I couldn't let him control the money. Girl, I couldn't let him make the decisions. Girl, I would have to have my own. And so I consistently felt like I was not doing enough or like I wasn't valued. And so I want women to understand there is value in being there for your children. There is value in being a help me to your husband. Like, and so it depends on what you're looking for. You know, do we want Pearly Things to start the conversation? I think she's doing a great job in doing that and getting people talking. Do I think that she really has the tools to actually make a difference and bring people together? I can't say that I completely feel like she does. Or that she even desires to. The desire to thing I think is interesting because I left yesterday going, she wants to be popular. She wants to make some money. She wants to be successful. She wants to, you know, and she's done that. She's moved out of her parents house and is on to bigger and better things. And it's, you know, building the studio and other things. But, but I'm wondering, is that even a fair question to be asking of her? Because did we ask the same questions of, let's say, Kevin Samuels, who spent a lot of time talking about relationships, making some of the exact same points, a lot of the same points as Pearly Things. Did we question what his motives were? Or did we celebrate the fact like, hey, man, this guy's built a great business talking about this? I think some people did question. And also he actually, from my understanding, had a dating service. So on the side, he put couples together to actually do what he was telling them. He wanted done between men and women. So from my understanding, he had a lot of couples that came together because of his leadership that he was a mentor to, that he was an advisor to. So I think if you're going to be saying these inflammatory things to get, you know, recognition or likes, you have to have, or you should have, a genuine desire to see men and women actually get past these things that are keeping us at each other's throats, that are keeping us from coming together to be fruitful and multiply, and to actually be productive citizens or reproduce more Christians, whatever your desire is. I think if you're going to be saying these things, then you should have a genuine desire to see people come together and not just, hey, women have no value or men have more value than women, and that's it. Because I think that there are a group of women, like I said, I was one of them that need to understand there is value in your femininity. You know, even the Bible talks about us God numbering the hairs on our head and we being more valuable than the sparrow. So I think that you can say these inflammatory things, but what next? And so I just don't know again if she's the conversation starter, all hell, Queen Pearly Things, but then you also have to have people to come in to add to that conversation so that we can actually move forward as a people. So it seems like most content, most artists, most everything has moved away from having some bigger purpose. I'm going to cite a couple of examples. One would be easy, just music. And, you know, rap music from KRS1, the public enemy, and the early days of rap, that there was like, hey, I'm going to educate people. And I'm going to educate black people on their history and instill some confidence in them and give them some information they can use to better themselves and to behave in society in a more confident fashion. And even in just traditional R&B music or whatever, I'm going to make some music that men and women can fall in love together with and make it be a part of their love story. And, oh, that's our favorite song, blah, blah, blah. Where now all the music coming out of R&B is just about pleasure and sex. And love has virtually nothing to do with it. And we certainly know what's happened to rap music, but I would even go as far as the sports world. There used to be a greater purpose about teaching concepts of manhood and fairness and hard work and discipline. All of that tied to participation in sports all the way up to the professional level, where now everything, the end goal is just, does it get you closer to the bag? And so, I guess I'm saying that Pearl and the phenomenon of Pearl, she's right in line reflecting what the entire culture, not just the entire culture, there's no larger purpose to what virtually any content creator is doing. It's, it's, go to the people talking about sports on ESPN or Fox Sports. They're not trying to elevate a conversation, they're just trying to trigger and attract viewers. And so, if, if, I'm reluctant, and this is where, again, I keep saying I said it last night on the Twitter spaces, I'm hopeful that Pearl as a young person will discover her calling and higher purpose and start taping her content to promote some greater purpose than just, hey, I want to make enough money so that I can do what I want to do and be as successful as my parents were and blah, blah, blah. And so, I think she's still capable of that, but I do think I came away from yesterday and today thinking right now, she just wants to be popular and successful and she's fallen into something that works and works for her personality. And, and again, if she were the stereotypical beauty queen, I don't think what she's doing works. I, I think her being the average girl next door and, and coming off as charming and innocent is a big part of the reason why she's having so much success. But, but I'm still really reluctant to be hyper critical because I'm further along in years and experience and vision than her. And, and, you know, it was interesting, same for you, but it was interesting. I thought Lauren Chin and Isabelle Riley had very interesting takes because they're in her age range and age group. And Lauren was, I thought, very respectfully critical of like, hey, she should be having a higher purpose. There should be, there should be more sophistication to her point of view than what's being expressed here. And so, I just, I, I, yesterday was fascinated and helped me think through a lot of things and, and I mostly come down like this whole man's fear and pearl phenomenon is, is a reflection to me of the failure of the church. And the church's not being the leaders in these conversations because we have a big, big dispute going on between, hey, who is going to be the leaders of this society? And, and the church is wrestling with that as it relates to the pulpit and this whole egalitarian view on ministers, but they're ignoring all of these day to day things that are impacting people, men in the workplace competing against women, men having to deal with their in the workplace competing against women and, and the playing field isn't level. The whole system is leaning in women's favor and emasculating men. Those things need to be talked about from a biblical point of view. And I think the church would be attracting a bigger audience and more men to the church, but instead that we've been relegated to the man's fear. And guys who aren't biblically sound, who, who are basically telling men, no men do what you want. It's these women that are out of order, get you a passport and go get you a woman who will allow you to do whatever the hell you want to do. It's, it's, it's really sad. And so it's, I don't know, your reaction to any of that. Yeah, you said so much. I definitely think Pearly Things is attractive to a lot of men because she's attainable. You know, they see a woman that they feel like they could actually get or pool or have a relationship with. And so that makes her very easy to digest for a lot of men, not simply because she's saying what they want to hear, but it's also like, okay, this is this everyday girl next door saying these things. So we should be able to expect this because, you know, this should be the average woman. So I think a lot of people do see her in that way. When you talk about her being younger, that's why I don't have as much criticism for her because she is young. She is only 26 years old. However, it's not lost on me that at her age, I was married at 27. I did my initial sermon. So I knew that there was a greater purpose for my life. And so what, what I do think though is her purpose may not be to have that deep conversation. So although I'm pointing out that she doesn't have a really deep conversation, that may not be her purpose. One person, one person plants to see another one water. God brings the increase. So her purpose may be exactly what she's doing, sparking the conversation so that people like you, people like me, other people who have more to add, Lauren Chin to the conversation can be able to see her. And so I think that she can be able to see her in that conversation can then jump in there and do our part. You know, instead of us kind of seeing this as, you know, a competition or a fight, I've seen a lot of women be angry at her. You can actually just jump in there and keep the conversation going. Because of my life experience, like she lacks that. But instead of me just saying she lacks life experience, I can tag some of the things that she's saying and say, she's right because and then add my life experience to that. So we can actually add to the conversation and grow the conversation and direct the conversation in the way that we feel like it should grow. Go. If we think that her saying women aren't valuable, isn't quite right. Well, while people, you know, while we have their attention, let's attack the conversation. Let's add to that and let's bring that, you know, depth of the conversation that needs to be had. So I just think because she's younger than my oldest daughter, I'm hesitant to just be one of these people that would just try to body slam her. You know, now if she comes after me, I'll go to like a fish, but, you know, but now I think it would just be great for us to add to the conversation and watch her develop and watch her grow. Because this will be a journey. When I think back to being 26, that seems like so long ago, but it has been a journey for me. And there have been things that I've learned along the way. And I know that she will as well at 36, she may have a slightly different message. It could be tweaked a little bit. You know, life will do that to you. And so I'm just open to giving her that space to develop and to grow and to mature and just see what happens and tag the conversation. I'm just going to tag it, you know, Jamaica, thank you so much. Appreciate it. Great job as always. Great job last night. We'll see you tomorrow.

I think that he may have missed our last two Wednesdays before we went on vacation, so it's good to have Anthony Walker back here with us to lead us in our Tennessee Harmony conversation. And Dave Shannon, the Idaho Potato, is going to join us from Idaho for today's conversation as we continue our conversation about the kind of the manosphere and pearl and the feud between men and women about the natural order before we get into the conversation. We're going to ask Anthony to bless the conversation with a prayer. Father God, we're thankful for today and thankful for being back in this space. Father, we're thankful for this platform as always to be able to discuss everything within the sphere of a godly worldview. Bless those that listen and we pray that not only do we learn, but we're pointed back to your word. In Christ's name we pray. Amen. All right, so the past two days guys we've been having a conversation and I think I saw Dave Chalk Knox in the Twitter spaces last night lurking and listening. You should have raised your hand and piped in Dave, but anyway, I feel like coming off yesterday interviewing Pearl conversation last night, looking at the issue or the opportunity she sees. To speak for the manosphere and why the manosphere has such an attraction and I've reached the conclusion as you may have heard of my monologue or read in my column like, Hey, there's a fight and it's been a planet long fight about dominion and the natural order and, you know, man following God and God following woman. And we've now reached a point to where we're so out of order that we have a lot of chaos going on in the society and everybody's frustrated and everybody's pointing the finger. And, and, you know, one of the, the manosphere, I get it. People consider me a part of the manosphere. I'm a fan of the manosphere. I like Pearl. I do think the manosphere and Pearl are a bit delusional though, just saying that, Hey, it's women's fault and we're not recognizing it. And these are things I had to deal with myself in myself like, Hey, I'm part of the problem. My disobedience to God is a big part of the problem. And I think that finger point at myself basically points to all men, the things that I'm frustrated with about women. I think I'm to blame for that. It's, I've created. I've given them the out to not follow me because why should they follow me? You're not following God. Why should I follow you? Am I? No, no, that's, that's it. I think, you know, hearing, reading your column, one of the points that I liked about that is you pointed out the need or the why the manosphere even came into existence. Why that space is, but when you point it back to responsibility, biblically even, we're the, we're the problem. Like if we didn't, if we stood up as men, if we even repented, and that's the thing that I think sometimes we overlook, it's not that we're saying, Hey guys, you got to be perfect. We're striving for perfection, but even men who have failed, those who have made poor decisions, those who have sinned, those who have contributed. Okay, you're still in the game. Repent, get back in the game and lead like you're supposed to, but when men fail to stand up, when men fail to lead as they're supposed to, anything will fill that void. So that's idolatry, that's greed, that's feminism, that's LGBTQ plus, anything will fill the void when we don't do our part. Dave. Yeah, you know, Jason, as soon as I got done reading your article, there's a couple things that popped in my head immediately from scripture, one of them pertaining to the manosphere and Pearl. I think that we're missing an opportunity here. ti some convictions because that's her position. And she's out there, she's fighting, and she's actually getting the attention. She's actually gaining ground. I mean, she's just on social media posting and having a massive impact. And I have my problems with Pearl. So don't get me, don't think that I'm just a. That we have, she's having such a massive impact that the church should look at that and say, man, we've been trying to get the youth. We've been trying to get the attention of men. We've been trying to have some sort of social cultural impact. And here it is a 26 year old white girl in London and England is sitting here kicking butt. And I think that her engagement should let us be a little convicted about what's going on. That we don't have that type of impact and engagement and culture in the society that we should have all the answers for. Dave, you're making a point and there was a couple times where you froze. And so hopefully that doesn't show up and maybe it only froze on my end. But you're making a point that I agree with that I want to drop in Anthony's lap. She is having an impact. The man is fierce having an impact because they're talking about things that I think a lot of times the church is reluctant to talk about and particularly talk about it in a bold way. And so let's take I read Tony Evans's book Kingdom Politics. And you know, it was an examination of politics from a spiritual biblical point of view. And I can remember coming on the show on one of my takeaways was like, Hey man, we got to figure out a way to empower the family in the voting process because the society should be more concerned about supporting the family than individuals. A nation is a collection of families. And it made me realize the book did. He didn't make these points, but my extrapolation from the book from the book was like, you know, women didn't used to vote because we were so tied in and committed to family that a family just needed one vote. And it represented the man and the woman. Now we're a group of individuals. And it's created a bunch of problems when the society doesn't. And so it when Pearl says, Hey, I don't think women should vote. I'm not sure if that's the answer. But I do think it's a legitimate conversation about that we should be having and that ministers should be giving thought to. I'm not saying ministers got to have the answer right now, but be giving thought to gathering amongst themselves and talking about it and hashing it out. And you know, what because as long as our culture and politics are catering to individuals rather than families, we're going to have problems. Sure. Sure. But that's okay. Take that conversation. You just made it would have been better probably, I don't know, 50, 100 years ago. And here's why. Now we've gotten to a space to where we don't even know societally what a family is. So if you were to say if you were to implement that kind of talk, talking point now, there's okay, well, let's we look how we're doing for voting to, you know, incentivize families. Well, now we've got a family could be two or three different women and a guy if he choose like it's, and I'm not saying to not engage in it, but the thought process is right in terms of, okay, how do we reshape society where we're back to thinking family? But now we've gotten so far away from the, you know, we don't even know what a marriage is. We don't know what a man or a woman is like we're having to start over, which I'm taking now, you know, as a man, I'm taking as a challenge to say, okay, here's the prime point, especially for the church to come in and help us to deal with the very basics of life. Here's what a man is. Here's what a woman is. Here's what a marriage is. That was what God did even in, you know, as establishing the church. The beginning of the book all the way to the end of the Bible starts with a marriage ends and marriage. It's all about marriage. Paul tells us in Ephesians chapter 5, he talks about a husband loving his wife as Christ loves the church, a woman submitting to her, a wife submitting to her husband as unto the Lord. But then he ends that chapter by saying, y'all think I'm just talking about marriage, I'm talking about Christ in the church. So even marriage takes us back to how Christ and the church operates. If we lose all of that, we're going to be discussing the issues and that's kind of my issue with it. Sometimes men were reactive and biblically we should be proactive. We should be taking the lead in this rather than looking back. So now you have men that look back and we say, man, I'm so upset about this and look at where society is. I'm saying, hey, the only way we're going to be able to get that is when we get back to the word. Get back to who you're supposed to be, how your family's supposed to be, how you're raising up your kids. All of that determines where our whole society goes. Let me let me say this and then you'll get back in. But as a family, and Chuck Knox knows this well, he's got a whole, you know, what about 11, 12 of them. But they, you know, what he's putting into the world, his kids are going to have a worldview shaped on how he loves his wife. They're going to know that. His sons are going to know, man, this is what it means to be a man, a husband, a father. His daughters are going to know this is what it means to be a woman, a wife, a mother. They're going to get that. They're going to see how that functions. When they go out into the world, they're going to want to replicate what they came from because that was the standard. So looking at that, looking at even my family, one of the best contributions that I will make to society, not all the sermons I preach, not all the posts we have, but it's going to be about me loving my wife and me raising my kids because that's going to set what the worldview looks like in their mind. They're going to know how it means to love God, how it means to worship God, how it means to operate. They're going to get that. And then that goes into the world when they run into the world. And this is crazy. No, I can't, I can't participate in all this because I came up differently. Knox. I'm just here to say amen to everything he just said. That's what I'm here to do. My goodness. You know, I just want to pick up on one thing. I want to maybe organize it a little differently than Pastor Anthony, though, but that was phenomenal. The vote. I just want to talk about the voting thing a little bit. The voting thing she is dead right about the voting thing. And what Pastor Anthony is saying is you're not going to get to have that conversation if you can't define the reality and the functionality of the family and the structure of the family. I'll even go and say a little more. We're not going to be talking about voting in the 19th and repelling that. If we got the SBC out here allowing women to vote in the SBC and not families to vote there. I mean, you have the same problem, but it's starting in the church first. And so we're going to have to have a massive reconsideration of what the Bible says about the family and the structure of the church before we ever can start talking about what we do in the voting area and the voting booth. Whenever God goes to clean up a place, he always starts at the House of God. It doesn't start at the United States Supreme Court. It doesn't start at the voting booth. It starts in the House of God. It works his way out through the family. And then from that point, it touches every aspect of society that the family participates in. Excellent point. Glad you made that and that'll lead me then to the importance of the fight that is going on in the SBC right now. No, I mean, this whole Rick Warren again, that's a critical, critical issue. Dave, you first, then Anthony, you follow in. How is that fight going? Who is winning that fight? How does that, or are we about to see the whole destruction of the SBC and it's going to have to be remade anew? Some great news. The last convention, they voted out Rick Warren's church because of the fact that they didn't hold to the Baptist faith and message, which did not allow women to be elders and teachers. So for now, that is a battle that the SBC has won according to how they feel that the Baptist faith and message, I believe it was in 2000. It made it very clear what the duties of an elder and a pastor were. And so they confirmed that they are still holding into that reality, at least being able to slightly still define what a woman is. And kick out the churches that are implementing women inside of the church. I think that's going to have some cultural impact. I think that's going to have some political impact. But the question is, so then now I think the SBC is going to have to say, let's now go a little deeper and define what is a woman, because we almost failed that battle. We were too close to failing that battle. We left it up in the air too much. This should have been an open and shut case. We're going to have to go back and understand the metaphysical, biblical realities of a man and a woman. We don't send women off to war. The SBC is clear on that. So then why would you send her out to a pulpit or consider sending her out to the pulpit? Your attitude towards a woman going into battle should be the same attitude about her going to the pulpit. You are sending her to die. A man takes on the man pastor, Anthony knows this. When you take on the mantle to be a pastor, to be a priest, you take on the mantle to represent the people and to die, to lay your life down. You die first. You take the first bullet. You take the first hit. Women are different creatures. We don't treat them like that. So that's not an office for them to hold. But that doesn't mean that they don't hold an office that's good for the society and the building of the church. They birth children. That's the most valuable thing that we can have. So the SBC is doing good. In this case, I was happy to see that they booted Rick Warren's church and other churches. I think they're taking action on as well. So we can rest assured that at least today on that issue, the SBC is not looking like they're failing. He really helped me understand your point of like, Jason, you think that's the fundamental issue, but no, no, no, we got to go. We got to go back to page one of Genesis. Yes. I think 13. We got to go anyway. Yeah. No, he basically framed it right. It's they're now having to step back. Yes, they're taking some of the right steps in terms of trying to decide if women can be, you know, pastors, etc. But that's having to now to reexamine. Okay, but what are we really saying? And that's going to be, I don't know if it's going to dissolve or whatnot, but it is there. Things are coming to a head where some strong decisions are going to have to be made as to how they define women, their roles, and what Rick Warren is doing on the side is muddying the water because he's trying to make it about gift and not about authority. You know, what did God actually say? God didn't say that they may not have the gift or may not have the ability, but do they have the right authorization? Can you do this? And that's the end of it. You know, if God says it, that settles it. We should be good with that. But because we've muddied the water, now it becomes a big issue. Listen to that point, this is something Pearl actually has been arguing in the past week is like that they may have the gift and she's not speaking biblically, but she's like, yeah, female teachers are good, but there's a lot of data that show male teachers actually get far better results. And so I would think that probably applies to the ministry. And that's not said to diminish women or to put them in their place. It's to recognize the reality of how we were designed and what people respond to. Yeah, I listen to a lot of this stuff, but you know, there's a lot of data that will show you that leadership and CEO positions and like if you're six foot two, you actually and you actually achieve at a higher level than shorter men. And so if that's the case, if there's something in eight in a something within us that makes us more ready to follow someone who's taller. And if the facts are that you can't blame this on any sexism or misogyny that women on average are four inches, five inches shorter than men, maybe, maybe all this data points through a fact of like when it comes to leadership, we were designed in a way that men would be leader. I'm going to let you stick with your data, Jason. I'm going to let you hold it on to that. I'm looking at it from just from a biblical space, honestly, sometimes we try to question or define or figure out, okay, why did God do it this way? And that may be good for discussion, good for fodder, etc. But those who are really concerned about being what God has called us to be, hey, I just accepted this is this is what God does. And so when God puts man as the head of the wife, when we understand what that term means, headship biblically, we look at headship or leadership as it relates to title, position, power, etc. Biblically, headship and leadership dealt with responsibility much more than title position. So when we look at man being the head, it's not just him being able to walk around with his chest out. Yeah, I'm the head of the house. God's going to look at that. No, you're responsible for that house. You're responsible for saving your household. So now your mindset is less on having the title but more on bearing the responsibility, serving, nurturing, caring, teaching, admonishing, bringing them up so that they be saved and so that they're prepared for the world that we go into, not so much as the title. So and then as it relates to women, the fact that God in his infinite wisdom, yes, man, you've got dominion, but woman, I want you to bring them into this world. Wow, like he could have done it the other way. Men, I want you to bear them as well. But he gave it to them. And as Knox just said, that is a powerful, powerful thing to birth into this world. And God, because of his infinite wisdom, he uses your body to nurture them, develop them, and bring them into the world. And he even uses your body to feed them for the formative years, a formative months in their life. Like that's miraculous. It's powerful. Give him glory for that. And then let's walk in our function and not worry so much about, you know, the hierarchy that we try to put them in, work in your function and glorify God. How many women do you think, understand or have been taught that, and this is just me piggybacking your point of like, okay, God has given you the responsibility to birth humanity. And if he had given you the responsibility of headship and control, that you would be under so much stress that you would undermine your ability to birth proper humanity. And perhaps that's part of the reason why baby mama culture, single mothers or whatever, that when a woman is carrying all of that responsibility and trying to take care of the baby while in the womb and do all that other stuff, that she can't do it. And the kids are damaged by that. Do we think? And again, these are foundational things that I think you're saying like, have to be understood again, because they've been forgotten. We just think like, oh, a single mama can do everything that an intact family can do. And there's no repercussions to this. I just don't think most people understand that. There are many repercussions there. The man who tries to do that to the woman who tries to do that got designed it for a purpose. And we look back when we walk in that purpose and live according to it, we see the blessings from it. But at the same time, when we don't walk according to it, we don't live according to his design and purpose. We see the curses of it. We see the repercussion of what comes about. We see, you know, I can look at women who may have the mindset attitude, a masculinity, toxic, all men or dogs and all this kind of stuff. And I can point back to a father who wasn't loving to her mom, a father who didn't love her as he was supposed. I can see that. I can see men who view women as objects. And I can point back to a father who treated a mom like an object. I can point back to a father that didn't do. So it goes back to that. And when we walk in it, when we do it, not question it, when we do it, and you see what God really does with this. I'm just sitting here thinking about the rise in autistic children. Here's one. Man, I wonder why that's happening. I wonder what's changed. Is it vaccines? Is it this? Is it that? And it may just be us all being outside of our roles and not handling our responsibilities properly. Knox, go ahead and jump back. Yeah, you know, I just want to remind everyone too that dominion is to be had by both men and women. When God told man to take dominion, it was a command for humanity. It was a human command. How we do that is different. And so man and women take dominion. The way that the woman takes dominion is by subduing, admitting herself to her husband. This is where Titus three talks about that. And matter of fact, a man who knows how to take dominion knows that his wife is his number one weapon and winning and shutting the mouth of the culture war. Because Titus three makes it clear from her, teaching and loving her kids and teaching younger women to obey their husbands. And the beauty that comes from the house, they become the type of testimony that shuts the mouth of the pagans. They have nothing to say because of that type of beauty. And so women taking dominion is essential. That's what the enemy partially wants to do is to get the man out of having his help meet in the right position. That's what the. So if he can get the woman to out of her position, then man can't properly take dominion the way that he needs to take dominion. And so it's essential that men protect their wives from the serpent and from the kind of the conversation of the secularists. And then they also nurture them so that they can produce the type of yields that David talks about that says our societies are built are the women are the pillars of our societies. And that's because of men who protect and keep them and allow them to do beautiful things, which is the weapon that shuts the mouth of the pagans. Thank you guys. Thank you guys both. Great Tennessee. Harmony will queue up some harmony. And we'll see you tomorrow. Yeah. How did we end up so divided? Stop fighting in the same home. We used to be a nation one United. Now we're headed for a downfall. We're going to let you latch on down. What we need more than anything now. Harmony. Let's make a simple plan. Let's come together now. Harmony. Put all your weapons down. Love on another night. Harmony. Time for us to wake up. To love my sister, my brother. See through the lies you tell us. Cuz together we're so much stronger.
