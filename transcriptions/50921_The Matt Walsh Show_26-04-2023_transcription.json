    "text": " Today that wall show jazz Jennings is one of the most prominent trans identified people in the country He's also an abuse victim who has been brainwashed by the evil adults in his life, especially by his mother jazz jazz posted a video Criticizing me this week and I'll give my response today also a woman accusing Tucker Carlson of creating a hostile work environment has been doing the media rounds will analyze her claims today and We have an all-time classic to add to the catalog of terrible Camille Harris speeches Finally companies are sending opt-out emails to save customers from having to receive traumatic mother's day emails What's that all about we'll talk about it and much more today on the mat wall show The pro-life battle has finally left DC and is going to the grassroots as one of the largest pro-life organizations in the entire world No one is in a better position than 40 days for life to end abortion in a post-row America with 1 million volunteers in 1500 cities 40 days for life holds peaceful vigils outside abortion facilities because of that they actually have a larger presence in blue states Specifically, California former abortion clinic director say that these vigils can cause the abortion no show rate to go as high as 75% which is very detrimental to their business, which is a very good thing these law abiding vigils have helped close abortion facilities in San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago Many other cities as well. They're also leading the way in efforts to prevent pharmacies from dispensing chemical abortions You can support their work and check out their locations podcasts and free magazine at 40 days for life calm It's really important that you do that because if you think that this is this issue is over and it's all solved now because Row is on the ash heap of history. You're totally wrong. The fight has never been more important So for more information on 40 days for life go to 40 days for life calm jazz Jennings is a name you probably recognize He's now a 22 year old man who identifies as a woman or I should say was identified Was identified as a woman that this is not a path that Jennings chose for himself It was chosen for him at a very young age and we know that about him And we know much else about him because his parents not only chose to make him trans from a young age But also chose to make him a public figure from a young age We're told that Jennings was first diagnosed with gender dysphoria at the age of four Though his mother insists that he identified as a girl before that before he was even old enough to talk somehow He was identifying as a girl by six years old The child was already doing the media rounds his mother Shuffled him from one interview to the next he was featured on 2020 and the Rosio Donald show Which existed at the time as well had him by the age of seven jazz's parents had established their own foundation Which is the trans kid purple rainbow foundation and this foundation was made so that they could assist trans youth And also as it happens receive donations You know coincidence there that they started doing the media rounds and then they started a foundation where they could take donations You know total coincidence barely in a middle school jazz started in his first documentary I am jazz a family in transition premier on the Oprah Winfrey network in 2011 a couple years later jazz had another 2020 interview will follow up two years after that while still a child jazz quote-unquote co-wrote a children's book about his life titled I am jazz And I was in the same year that jazz Jennings began receiving awards and accolades and recognition from organizations like GLAD and Time magazine and many others a year later the jazz Jennings reality TV show debuted on TLC when he was still a kid followed by the jazz Jennings memoir And while he was being constantly filmed and documented with his with this, you know spotlight shining on him He was also at the same time being led from one step in the medical transition process to the next starting with of course The chemical castration drugs at the age of 11 followed by hormones and then genital mutilation at the age of 17 Now, yes, we're told right that nobody's performing actual surgeries on kids That's not happening and yet and yet one of the most prominent trans identified people in the country Had surgery when he was a kid. I was just the first surgery by the way by the age of 20 jazz had undergone three quote-unquote gender confirmation surgeries So you still wasn't old enough to legally purchase a beer Bud Light presumably and yet he had been taking drugs for for nearly a decade at that Point and beginning one gender transition surgery after another for the past three years before that Jazz's mother was there every step of the way of course helping him along and that quote help But often take on a very aggressive and horrendously disturbing forms listen to this clip from the reality show Just a few years ago shortly after jazz got I think this is his first surgery and here's his mother With her I'm worried about like her mental well-being and her Diillation minutes to leave my house. We have a dilation problem. That is a concern We don't have that watchful eye They tend to go back to old patterns I have woken jazz out of a dead sleep and taken the dilator and put the lubrication on it and said here You take this and you put it in your vagina if not I will but jazz is bad even when I'm home once a day I would be so mad if she Goes way of college and that thing seals up. I Bring her neck Can we imagine no we can't We cannot imagine any of this yet. It's happening. Yes, that is the the mother of jazz Jennings talking about how he forcibly How she forcibly? Dialates her son's fake neo vagina in the middle of the night You know normal mom stuff and this never-ending process of dilation and lubrication is necessary to prevent the quote-unquote vagina From closing up because it's not a vagina. It is an open wound which is carved into the place where the male genitalia used to be This is what was done to jazz Jennings at the age of 17. He was butchered turned into a lifelong medical patient in Pursuit of something that he can never attain searching for a female identity that will always be out of reach And this explains why most recently Jazz was on camera on the reality show Expressing deep and profound despair and telling his mother that he quote unquote doesn't feel like himself. Listen So are you feeling like you wanted to start talking about? Are you okay? I'm okay. I'm gonna cry But you know, I can't get out of my head. I know now listen I know it just doesn't stop. It's okay. Give me that's okay. I know what you're going to have been there No, it still doesn't stop now. I'm already going back to negative But you're more you're talking about yourself. It gets harder. Mm-hmm. You're digging in and you're it's making you put a magnifying class on what's already Difficult as it is So this is hard for you. I know and you don't we don't want to know. I'm the one doing it like I know you're your own more enemy I Feel kind of all over the place and like my mind is very cluttered and not clear and I really want to have that clarity I really want to understand myself and be able to read my own soul and what I want and it's just very challenging I think I'm kind of breaking down a little bit and spiraling into negativity. I Just want to feel like myself like that's it. I don't care All I want is to be happy and feel like me and I don't feel like we ever I Know what you're going through she says I really do you did your mom take you to dr Frankenstein to be genitally butchered as well. So you know what that's like Of course, this is terrible to watch unfathomably sad and I feel nothing but sympathy and compassion for jazz Jennings He was subjected to a lifelong brainwashing campaign which began practically from birth and which led to permanent physical changes in his body long before He could have possibly had any chance to realize what was being done to him He is a he is a victim Though like many abuse victims. He is at at this point in his life Not able to see it not able to see the fact that he's an abuse victim or at least not able to accept it That's what came through yesterday when jazz published a video in his own YouTube channel responding to a number of conservative commentators including myself Jazz reacts to a segment of this show from a few weeks ago where I am myself responding to that clip We just watched of jazz expressing despair and apparent regret and in his response He says that I've misconstrued it and he insists that the surgery brought him happiness and joy and then we get to this part So now let's go to this the same person Not even gonna name him and this is what he says later in the interview. This is the person everyone who said Jazz is so unhappy and it's because of this is what he says You ready? Let's watch and I want you to respond to this and maybe whatever you want to say to this. Okay. You ready? Mother brainwashed this kid into doing this and now she's gonna keep that brainwash go brainwash So he may never fully come in terms of what happened at least as long as it's disgusting the retching of others still alive It's just really hard to watch that. I don't know why people like are So intent on bringing our community down like why do you care? Let us just be let us be happy. Let's be ourselves. We're not hurting anyone You know we need to celebrate each other in our diversity not bring each other down and anytime you're wishing death on anyone I think you need to take a step back and look at yourself and you're you know Whatever's going on with you. My mom is not the abuser people like him are the ones abusing us by saying These awful negative things about our community You know we are under attack and it is clear in this video that there are people out there who want hurt us Who want to see us fail who want to see us be miserable? And that's really fucked up because we're not wishing that upon anyone We just want people to open their eyes and see that we are beautiful Everyone is beautiful and everyone deserves to be their authentic self our messages are about love about positivity and just to see someone like this saying such a negative things. It's No, it's hurtful. It sucks my whole life. I have faced bullying. I have faced people You know attacking me and my identity and I just wish people would let me be you know, why do you? It's so frustrating now I was gonna respond to this just sort of in general terms But I think instead I'd like to be more direct jazz has addressed me directly asked some questions and I'd like to answer them So jazz first of all I Understand why you're frustrated that people are talking about you and from your perspective involving themselves in your private life You are absolutely right that your conversation with your mother that we saw there about your own deep emotional and psychological pains Should not have been a public spectacle. I Never should have seen that or heard it. Nobody should have but I Didn't make it a public spectacle and I didn't make you into a public figure your mom did that She she did it way before you could have possibly chosen this chosen any of this for yourself She had you on 2020 and starring an Oprah Winfrey specials when you were a young child She had a camera in front of your face. She was parading you around as a mascot for transgenderism at an age when you know When I was at age I was I was spending my time watching cartoons and playing outside in the woods and I wish That you had a childhood like that you deserved to have that kind of childhood, but your your mom Took that away from you. She was more interested in monetizing you Using you as a vehicle to promote her ideology And it's proven to be an effective vehicle, which is why I have to respond You want to be left alone. I get that I Wish that you were left alone way back when you were a child left to simply be a child that that's the life You should have had you had a right to it and It was taken from you By the adults in your life, especially your mom, and I'm sorry that it was taken from you. I truly am Listen even if it was even if it was somehow true That you really are a female you need to go through this necessary process of becoming your true self through the surgeries and everything else Which it isn't true at all. It just simply isn't But that still would not justify your mom's decision to turn you into a public figure as a child a symbol for a cause From such a young age Even if we accept the logic behind transitioning children, which again I do not accept and never would it still would be unforgivable For a parent to make it into a public exhibition Which is what your parents did Now you also accused me of wanting to hurt you and make you miserable. I don't I'm not out to hurt you I see I see that you are hurt. You said it yourself. You don't feel like yourself And you don't feel like yourself because you have been led since childhood down a path of self rejection You say that everyone deserves to be their authentic self I could not possibly agree more deserve is an apt choice of words in fact in this case every child deserves To be shown the way towards truth and and their own true selves every child deserves to grow up in the light Surrounded by adults who are sources of clarity and guidance for them You didn't have that and you still don't and That's not fair You have been fed lies one lie after another and they are the worst kinds of lies there lies that deprive you of the Recognition of your true self. This is the deepest form of abuse I can't imagine what it does to a person to live with it every day since the earliest moments of childhood Nobody in your life will tell you the truth Nobody in your life has ever told you the truth They have never been honest with you about anything ever They all are incentivized to keep up the deception Well, I have no incentive other than my own love of the truth and my concern for you as a person Am I concerned for everyone else in your same situation? I don't stand again anything when I tell you this, but I'll tell you anyway You are a man to you are There's nothing wrong with who you are with who you actually are Your maleness was never a problem that needed to be fixed The adults in your life Told you that you were sick. They diagnosed you and they labeled you and they defined you by those labels They introduced horrific confusion into your life and then they profited off of that confusion. They exploited you All of them did the doctors your parents the activist groups the media the TV networks They all swarmed around you like vultures taking pieces of you And now those same people they want you to live a lie for the rest of your life because if you don't If you don't it will embarrass and potentially impoverished them Well if we're talking about what people deserve they deserve that You deserve the truth And I'm telling it to you even if it hurts to hear Still you need to hear it at least once in your life Now let's get to our five headlines Companies are strong arming their customers to support abortion Cancelling customers for their political views and making a mockery of women by supporting transgender models No government agency institution or company is allowed to just be what it is and focus on fulfilling the tasks that it was made to fulfill A beer company can't just make beer anymore their primary concern is not with brewing and distributing beer But was showing their support of the left's political and cultural agenda But public Square offers a new solution public Square is an app and it's a website as well where you can get connected to tens of thousands of businesses From all different industries that share your value for life family and freedom Public Square also offers discounts to many high quality businesses on the platform So you can actually have an incentive to spend money with companies that don't hate you Whether you're looking for new athletic clothing that knows what a woman is a banking partner that you count on simply a new Restaurant in your area that won't lecture you about your political views as you're trying to enjoy a meal with your family Head over to public Sq.com.

That's public Sq.com Let's start with something fun something we all always enjoy Camela Harris giving a speech and as always for whatever reason Attempting to inflate the word count nobody can figure out why she feels the needs always do this But she does and here's how it came out this time. I Think it's very important as you have heard from so many incredible leaders For us at every moment in time and certainly this one To see the moment in time in which we exist and are present and To be able to contextualize it to understand where we exist in the history and in the moment as it relates Not only to the past but the future It is so important at every moment in time and at each individual moment in time Certainly this moment in time but also the next moment in time and even the moment in time after the next moment in time which proceeds the moment in time After that and through all these moments moment after moment after moment time after time If you're lost you can look and you will find me moment by moment through all the moments You know what I just figured out I figured out I just as I'm babbling like male Harris I realized I figured out Camille Harris in every speech She is Ben Stiller saying grace in meet the parents that every speech is like watching that scene Where Ben Stiller is put on the spot and has to say try to figure out how to say grace It's like every speech she does but it doesn't make sense because you know he was put on the spot She's not being put on the spot. These are right. It's it's it's not like she's um Five wines deep at the wedding and now she has to give a toast and she didn't prepare anything And so she's rambling these are pre-planned official speeches Right and if you're a politician if you're the really if you're the vice president You're you have served no function other than to show up to stuff like this and give dumb speeches That's all you do and so I always assumed anyway that don't they have people on staff that they write these things for you And they tell you oh you're gonna speech here for what's that for oh for this whatever stupid thing And then they hand you the paper and you read it or will you put it up on the prompter? That's what I can't figure out. Do they really send her out there to to riff for all these events Or maybe they are writing this you know that could be the twist ending that all this stuff We're making fun of Camila Harris. Maybe she's reading all of this directly from Proctor It could be more like rather than meet the parents more Maybe it's more like the scene in idiocracy where the president you know starts the state of the union address And he's like I know it's real bad right now And then you look and you see the prompter and it says that on the prompter so it could be that you know this could be um An ongoing act of sabotage against Camila Harris by her speech writing team I don't know what it is, but the end result is that it's very funny at least All right From the l. Y. Representative Alexandria KZO Cortez celebrated Fox News's firing a former host Tucker Carlson on Monday saying that Deep platforming works and that good things can happen KZO Cortez's remarks came after she claimed over the weekend that Carlson was responsible for incitement of violence And that lawmakers needed to be open to explore through law ways to regulate news content on networks like Fox News so This is very fortuitous timing for her and makes her feel very good because yeah in fact just a couple of days before Tucker Carlson was fired She was out In fact in fact the day before it was announced that he was fired She was on the news saying that he needs to be deplatformed and then what do you know it happens? Let's start by watching this from POC Tucker Carlson is out at Fox News Couldn't have happened to a better guy um What I will say though is Is While I'm very glad that the person that was arguably responsible for the some of the largest driving some of the most uh amounts of death threats and violent threats not just to my office but to Plenty of people across the country. Um, I also kind of feel like I'm like waiting for the cutscene at the end of a marvel movie after all the credits have rolled And then you see like the villains like hand Reemerge out to clip grip over like the end of a building or something but deplatforming works and it is important and um There you go. Good things can happen Deplatforming works she says and um That's That's sort of true. You know it also it also very often backfires against them you know in fact Speaking of which There as we know there's been this effort to deplatform me on youtube and everything else Well, uh, I'm posting this to twitter yesterday, but after all of that Uh, my podcast is ranked top five on uh apple podcast and spotify in our category Um in large part in response to all these deplatforming efforts So she says it works, but that's often the end result as long as Right as long as when when you're when they're doing this cancellation campaign against you as long as you refuse to apologize and you stay on message Okay as the target of the cancellation as long as you do that You could come out on the other end having a larger platform and more influence than you had before and I have no doubt that That will happen with tucker carlsen It's not carlsen is going to be the I believe Trying to peer into the future through my crystal ball I believe this tucker is going to be the prime example the number one example Of how deplatforming ultimately blackfires on these people Because he's going to go somewhere else he's going to do something else and he's going to have more influence than he's ever had before I think that's what's going to end up happening But in the short term Yeah, it does it does work in the sense that you you don't somebody's on a platform and they're saying things and they're able to reach an audience And we know on the left they cannot engage with any of it. They can't argue against any of it They have no rebuttals to offer whatsoever. So all they can do is just Forceably stop you from talking at least on that platform And then you go over to another one and they follow you there and they try to get rid of that. That's all they can do So she feels like she got a big win here which that alone It is unforgivable and disgraceful by fox news That they would give this kind of at least in the short term this seeming apparent win to the left rewarding their deplatforming efforts a day after AOCs talking about how it needs to be censored by the government tucker harlson should have been on air and it probably would have been on monday Responding to that and it said fox news can some So this was this was a disgraceful move by fox for a lot of reasons But let's just start with that You are rewarding Your own enemies Who turns out and not really your enemies because you're on the same side in so many ways But the question still remains about why this termination happened and there have been many reports about how it was related to lawsuits and so on And you know, I I told you yesterday. I don't buy that. I just don't buy it I have no inside information. I have no insight I have no sources that i'm talking to All I have is my own bs meter that I that is usually pretty well honed And uh, and I don't buy it. I don't buy anything to do with lawsuits I told you yesterday that to me this is simply this happened because because of who tucker is And what he says and the stands that he takes um The fact that he's actually an effective right wing Figure an advocate That's why he's not welcome at fox and that's why they got rid of him and now there's a new report from vanity fair which seems to confirm this So this is vanity fair. It says 24 hours after fox news ousted its high rated highest rated host The network has yet to explain one of the most shocking Defense stations in cable news history. I'm not gonna I'm not going beyond the release of fox news folks woman Uh texted yesterday when I asked her for comment In this information void multiple theories about why fox fired carlson circulated in the media It was fallout from the dominion settlement. It was punishment for vulgar text messages published in dominion court filings It was a consequence of former fox bruiser abby grossberg's lawsuit, which we'll talk more about that in a minute Uh, which alleged carlson oversaw a hostile work environment Uh, but none of these potential reasons fully add up Fox news anchor maria, uh, barter Bartaromo hyped dominion of conspiracies far more than carlson did and yet she remains in on the air fox had access to carlson's texts and emails And binging lawsuit for months and they didn't punish him so on and so forth. So that's why all that doesn't line up Mystery remains why did fox news take its biggest star off the air a new theory has emerged according to the source Fox corporation, uh chair rupa merlock removed carlson over remarks that carlson made during a speech at the heritage foundations 50th anniversary gala on friday night Carlson laced his speech with religious overtones that even merdock found too extreme According to the source who was briefed on merdock's decision making carlson told the heritage audience that national politics has become A battle between good and evil carlson said that people advocating for transgender rights and dei programs want to destroy america and they could not be persuaded with facts Quote we should say that and stop engaging with these totally fraudulent debates. I've tried that doesn't work The answer carlson suggested was prayer. I've concluded that it might be worth taking just 10 minutes out of your busy schedule to say a prayer for the future and i hope you will That's what he said. It's a great speech by the way Um and everything that he says in the speech is 100 accurate. This is in fact Uh a battle of good versus evil Um, this has gone well beyond any sort of debate over the facts because we we are debating with people who don't care about the facts They such as they don't care about the facts. They They reject the concept of facts They reject in principle the very idea that there can be a fact Okay, these are Relativists everything is all truth is relative. We all get our own truth Right, we all have we all live in our own universe. We have our own truth and we get to set the rules for our own universe According to our our own, you know emotional and narcissistic whims. That's what they believe That's what all this is about and it is a spiritual battle versus good of good versus evil Talk carlson's 100 correct about that And according to this report, that's a big reason why he got canned Um Quote that stuff freaks Rupert out. He doesn't like all the spiritual talk the source said Rupert murdock was perhaps unnerved by carlson's Uh, uh messianism because it echoed the end times world view of murdock's ex phyons say and lezli smith the source said in uh a may cover story of Vanity fair Murdock and smith called off their two-week engagement because smith had told people that carlson was a messenger from god Uh murdock had seen carlson and smith discussed religion firsthand and so apparently they were at a dinner back in march and uh Rupert murdock's then phyons say has Would have been going on wife number five. I think it was having this conversation with talk carlson Murdock was there and they were talking about all these things about how this is a spiritual battle good versus evil Rupert murdock was there. He didn't like that Uh shortly after that he dumped the phyons say and then shortly after that he gets rid of tucker carlson. That's the report anyway This makes a lot more sense I mean it doesn't make sense to fire him for it But it makes sense that fox would Uh makes more sense than anything tied to this abbey grossberg lawsuit, which You know Other media outlets are still claiming Is one of the central reasons why he got fired so yahoo has this Grossberg formerly a senior booking producer for fox news Um began working as the head of booking for tucker carlson tonight last year She was fired by fox news last month After filing suit against the company claiming that she was bullied and subjected to sexist and anti-Semitic comments while working on carlson's show There are other reports by the way that she never actually met tucker carlson She was never in the same room as him according to some reports But in a separate lawsuit filed in delore grossberg claimed that she was coerced by the company's lawyers to give misleading answers to her deposition In the dominion case in the 79 page lawsuit filed in the southern district of new york grossberg said that she was startled by the behavior of male Colleagues which she showed up for her first day of work on carlson's show in september According to grossberg, she arrived at the office to see many large and blown up photographs of nancy Pelosi in a plunging bath bathing suit revealing her cleavage I think we have uh, she also was doing the rounds on msmbc of course and other media outlets talking about all her horrible experiences working for tucker carlson And we have the clip of her talking about this uh traumatic encounter With nancy pollosi pictures. Let's watch that I was hoping that it would be more professional and what he was portraying on air was just a show and unfortunately that wasn't the case So when do you realize that? immediately I show up first day of work and I know that this is a popular one It's been widely publicized. There are literally pictures like this big of nancy pollosi in a bathing suit in europe Plastered all over Um, there was even one on my computer screen for the temporary computer. I had to use and I had to take it down just to work um Within a few days there I was called into just in wells office with alix mccass school who was a senior producer as well and Asked if maria was having an affair with kevin mccarthy It was just I was shocked. I couldn't even believe it. I was floored Uh, that's that's pretty funny. Look, you know what abby you're the one body shaming nancy pollosi. So what maybe they're Maybe they they think that nancy pollosi is a beautiful woman and uh and and and that's all right. You know, it's it Yeah This is your assumption. So you have decided to interpret that in a negative way shame on you Can you imagine if abby groseberg came to work for the daily wire and she uh encountered our uh Our our five foot tall, you know cigar store indian of uh of uh, elizabeth warren How would she I mean it should break down in tears immediately upon encountering that Uh, she also she says that uh staff members frequently engaged in group discussion in which misogynistic views of women as objects to be judged solely based on their appearance were broadcasted In these discussions no woman whether she was a republican politician or female staffer of fox news was safe from suddenly becoming the target of sexist demeaning comments In one instance cited by the paper the lawsuit recalled a crass and sexist discussion in the newsroom Before the republican gubernatorial candidate in michigan tutored ixen was scheduled to appear as a guest on carlshan show Before dixon arrived staffers discussed whether miss dixon or her opponent gretchen witmer was hotter That's an interesting question and that's a debate many of us have had Um, I think ultimately uh tutored ixen's gonna be the more attractive one Um, gretchen witmer, you know in my opinion the fact that she's so Evil it just you you can't quite maybe it's not fair to To deduct points based on that in the discussion of this sort but the fact that she is so Despicably horrifically evil. I think it does exude out of her and it actually affects her physically as well But a very interesting conversation Um that apparently traumatized poor Uh abby grossberg um And then uh, okay in another instance mccasco allegedly referred to uh a room In the office where fox news employees could pump breast milk as a waste of space Does someone work for fox said that the room for pumping breast milk is a waste of space And suggested it should be converted into a room of tanning beds for the guys to tan their testicles Um, you know if that was actually said Abby that's what's known as uh, we actually have a word for that. It's called a joke So that's a someone was making a joke is what they were doing if that was even said at all But she also accuses the tucker team of of saying and doing a lot of things that uh that Don't pass the smell test at all. So let's let's watch one more clip here When I got to tucker it was different and as a text that came out revealed my suspicions Um, he was looking for ratings bait purely Uh and was also looking for power. It was a combination of ratings and power and manipulating the audience, um And manipulating also the political system. There was an aspect of I can pick who the house speaker is. I can pick who the president of the united states is or who the republican candidate's going to be And I thought that was really dangerous and didn't want that kind of power. I didn't want to have Senate candidates calling me and Being very upset are you going to destroy our whole campaign tonight? Because he could do that and he would call and Tell them that that if you don't for participate or you don't come on the show We will destroy you and I was told to tell that to congressmen sometimes and I didn't how can I that was disrespectful? So in addition to the misogyny and the sexism and the anti-Semitism There was also just this sort of moral growth with me where I reached a breaking point because of all of those things and I literally did not want to do it anymore It felt disgusting. I stopped watching news When I came home, I didn't watch anything. I just didn't want to because I was so depressed and disillusioned By the entire media system because of Tucker Carlson Oh my moral growth, you know the only look the only mistake that uh The Tucker team made and it's not like this is Tucker Carlson himself. He doesn't he's not overseeing every aspect That's not the way it works But you know the only mistake obviously is hiring this woman But of course, it's just it's not always easy to sniff these kinds of people out Uh the kind of person who's going to see you know a joking picture of Nancy Pelosi if it's even true that the picture is a person But see a picture like that and be offended Just get over yourself. My god. How do you function in life? That's her moral. I'm with my moral growth and my moral growth, right? My moral growth was that I could work there And and take the paychecks in then I get fired And only then do do I do I turn you know I get fired and then I turn around and try to uh The profit to the tune of however many millions she's suing for that's all part of the moral growth suing For millions because you were offended by alleged jokes Right, that's a sign of moral growth. I will say though that I am There is one revelation from this that I that really disappoints me As much of a fan tuck karlson as I am You know when she said that tucker karlson Was interested in ratings good lord I I am so disappointed That he wanted to get ratings for his show So That is unacceptable and shortly tuck karlson the only figure in all of media That's concerned about ratings Everywhere it doesn't come up, you know, and I've worked in media. I can tell you right now I've never even encountered a conversation like this. No one talks about it Performance ratings, you know downloads advertising dollars We never discuss it in fact if i'm in a If it even On occasion someone's about to maybe i'm going to meeting someone broaches the conversation Well, let's look at the numbers. Nope. We're not talking about this doesn't matter how dare you Get out of the room I say to jeremy boring That's what happens in so tucker karlson the only figure in all of media who cares about ratings And so that is a scandal but all the rest of it not so much um And the claim that she as a like a booking producer was told to call up congressman and say come on the show or we'll destroy you Uh, that also didn't happen. That's that's not the way it works And this is why listen I don't know the percentages but it is my suspicion that the vast majority of Of hostile work environment claims are Really come they are they are used as cover By losers who couldn't hack it. That's most of it Because of something illegal or actually unethical happened then say what it was It is just name it, you know Give actual examples of that But when we get these kind of broad is a hostile work environment Um, no, you're just a loser and you couldn't hack it. You couldn't do it. It's a high pressure environment you know, you're working with a lot of uh You're working with a lot of high performance people and there's a lot of egos around That's just the way it is in the media business the way it's the way it's the way it's the way it is And at high levels in any industry. That's how it is um And uh, and she couldn't deal with it. She couldn't do it She couldn't keep up with the pressure And so she washed out now. She's filing a lawsuit. That is my That is my interpretation. That is my theory personally about this All right Maybe we have time for one or two other things uh kevin bacon has come to the defense of drag queens who perform for kids Uh, let's swatch that Drag is an art and drag is a right Drag is a centuries old art form of creativity expression and self-explanation It's an opportunity to educate through entertainment and it's not dangerous At six degrees We believe in amplifying the voices of those that are experiencing injustice So join us in supporting the aclu drag defense fund by shopping our bonfire campaign or making a gift Designed by the amazing mason k kira and i are honored to support this important fund and we welcome you To do the same Drag is a gift. He says drag is a um is a blessing Sounds a lot like david french. She's almost exactly quoting david french and saying some of this Uh the quote unquote conservative david french um This is one of the reasons why you know, I I think this this fight against The sexualization of children, especially as it comes in the form of you know drag events for children Is why it's so important? I mean it's important number one because it's a evil thing that we need to stop For the sake of the kids who are being victimized by it So that's the most important thing But also even from a kind of political perspective um I'm i'm more than happy for the democrats to go into 2024 Making this part of their platform and the more high profile democrats and liberals who come out Strongly in defense of not just drag but specifically drag queens performing in front of children I We know that they that they are in favor of it. We know they're in favor of the sexualization of children We know that's happening and since it's happening and since they're in favor of it I think it's good for them to say it out loud and to and to kind of wear this um Position with pride march under the banner so everybody can see it And make their decisions accordingly as we go into election season and beyond Because if you're like if you're a diet in the wool leftist Then your brainwashed into this too. You're you're in favor of the sexualization of children It's part of your whole It's part of your whole ideology, but anybody who's not you know, you don't have to be a far right extremists like myself If you're just not that if you're not a diet in the wool far left left is Then you you know, you just need to ask yourself Do you do you really believe this? Is it is this what you believe? Do you believe that? Not only is it okay for drag queens to perform sexually in front of children, but they have a right to Do you believe that grown men? Have the god given natural right to cross dress and perform sexually in front of children That's what we're hearing from everybody on the left democrats celebrities You just need to decide if that makes any sense to you And if you have any kind of uh soul left and any brain in your in your head then the answer to that Obviously will be no let's get to the comment section The first step in growing up and being a real man is getting off of your parents phone plan Getting your own self unplanned gives you a sense of independence and responsibility to step towards becoming more self-sufficient By paying for your own finances.

I think the bet that fox news is making Is that this will be kind of a bill o'Reilly situation? I you remember that and it could be easy to forget maybe that's part of the point that fach you know for fox news is part of their point That's so easy to forget this but for years bill o'Reilly was the biggest star in not just a fox news but in all of cable news and He was also kind of He was no tucker carlson don't get me wrong, but he was the biggest star at in cable news at the time driving conversation as well and then they they canned him and You know, he's still out there doing his thing, but he's not that anymore His audience didn't really follow him to his next endeavor and and because for in that case The time slot fox news itself and the whole structure they have in place And the time slot is what made bill o'Reilly a star and then they discard him And they put somebody else in and they say well make them a star And their bet is that it's going to be the same thing here that tucker carlson wasn't really the star It's fox news in the eight o'clock time slot eastern time. That's the star and we take him out and his audience will go away That's their bet. I think that um Although that has proven to be the case sometimes I think it's a bad bet with target carlson I think he's just a he's a different sort of media figure It's a different kind of media landscape even than it was back Even though it wasn't all that long ago and when bill o'Reilly was given the boot it's a different media landscape And uh, so I think it's I think it's a bad bet And I think that um Fox News is going to take a ratings hit that will not recover quickly and that tucker's audience will go with him wherever he goes uh Will says I was thinking when I was reading those accusations against don lemon man I hope matt doesn't pounce on this because this is really weak and he handled it beautifully lol Well, if you even thought you thought I would read some of those examples of don lemons Supposed sexism and then I would jump on that bandwagon and pretend that it was offensive What was one of them he said that uh He said one of the It's a woman that was on the air with him. He said you have mommy brain And this is supposed to be an example of oh misogyny Come on will did was there any thought in your head that I would read that and say well that's terrible That's well that he need to be fired for that Mommy brain that's unthinkable sexist Now come on Nothing wrong was saying that don lemon again Not even a defense of don lemon, but it's just a statement of fact He's not a sexist doesn't hate women. He's he probably hates everybody because he's a narcissist Only cares about himself like so many other people in media And uh and he disregards and hates everybody else Especially anyone who he perceives to be a threat to him Anyone who he thinks is more talented than him than him or getting better ratings than him And his ratings were always really bad. So that means he's just that's that's why he hates you Man woman doesn't matter However, he certainly deserved to be fired uh Just based on the fact that he's was Untalented and doing a terrible job Uh Mr public says I canceled my fox nation subscription I made sure to tell them that it was due to the way they treated tucker going out the door Bud light moment This and this is very and I thought about this as well. This is really interesting move on the heels of bud light And as we know When everything happened with bud light There were many people including on the right who said that look bud lights too big. It's just We can say that we're gonna boycott it. It's not gonna make a dent Um and that did not prove to be the case And I think there's also an assumption that fox news is because it's it's also a powerful brand and it's just kind of like by default You know, there are many um Middle america sort of conservative people that by default they would just go for the bud light just just like by default They go for fox news That didn't save bud light and I don't think it's gonna save fox news either And enigma says there's nothing more annoying than someone yelling on the phone out in public But it's even worse when the person they're yacking at is on speaker Yeah, I I why would you even want? I'll I will never understand it One of the one of the mysteries of life for me is why why would you even want to speak to somebody on speaker out in public? in the first place And you know, it's it's very rude to everybody around you because you're forcing them to Listen to this conversation. It's also rude for the person who's on speaker because they they probably don't know Because these the other thing when i'm around someone or they're speaking to somebody on the speaker phone I never hear that person tell the person on the phone. Oh, hey, by the way, you're in public right now There's 50 people standing around you're on speaker everyone can hear you continue. You never hear that warning being given So just don't do it And uh, like I said Many of these cases you really don't need to be using your phone at all All it is tempting certainly to blame postmodernism for ushering in a prevailing sense of nihilism The truth is this was an issue going all the way back to biblical times No one likes a complainer no matter what century you live in you just drag everybody down And the consequences of that are just as dire today. This is what dr Stephen blackwood points out in the 16th episode of exodus with jordan peterson check it out the vision of god Is a necessary condition of the flourishing of society And without that vision a people perishes Well, there's there's there's there's technical reasons for that. I would say that we know biologically now too is that Almost all enthusiasm and so that is to be filled with the spirit of god That's positive emotion and all positive emotion Of the of the most intense sort. I don't mean satiation and satisfaction. I mean hope and enthusiasm that moves you forward Is tied to a vision? Because all positive emotions signals movement towards a valued goal in addition to Stephen blackwood Jordan peterson is joined by a roundtable of impressive minds who have gathered to discuss one of the most seminal books in the bible We are heading into the conclusion of exodus which is exclusively for daily wire plus members If you haven't seen it yet start at the beginning because it's well worth your time. Trust me and join now at daily wire.com Subscribe to watch exodus now. Let's get to our daily cancellation Mother's day is just around the corner which means that it's time for some woke virtue signaling from corporate america Every holiday is an occasion for woke virtue signaling of course every day in general is an occasion But mother's day presents a unique opportunity and this year The virtue signaling is taking on a perhaps slightly unexpected form the daily wire reports quote major corporations and businesses are sending out emails Offering a chance to opt out of mother's day related communications And a viral thread posted sunday twitter account arizona informer posted more than a dozen screenshots from businesses sending mother's day opt out offers noting The similar language used in the emails and equating the trend with anti-family activism Arizona former caption something very strange is happening with big corporations out of nowhere Kroger owned fries food store k jewelers Hallmark and now door dash have all sent opt out of mother's day emails to their customer base This is not organic the account charge this reeks of anti-family activism We understand that mother's day might may be a difficult time for some a message from door dash said adding an option to be Remove from additional emails and push notifications relating to the holiday a message from k jewelers said We know mother's day can be a challenging time which is why we want to know if you'd rather rather not receive mother's day related emails Quote with mother's day coming up. We understand this can be a difficult time of year for some Read a similar email from nespresso if you would like to opt out of mother's day emails, you can simply click below Levi's ancestry mac cosmetics Stitch fix by by baby et c and others were some of the other companies included in the thread The list is even longer than this by the way seemingly all at once You know major companies across the spectrum have jumped on the mother's day opt out train And this this is one of the one of the hallmarks of wokism Is that you know the the new form of virtue signaling pops up out of nowhere And in the blink of an eye Everyone is expected to embrace it Even if they have no idea why they're embracing it Because all these corporations that are sending out emails you can opt out of mother's day Do they even all know why they're doing this? They just saw everyone else doing this. Oh, yeah, we got to get one of those out In the corporate world especially the new virtue signal spreads like wildfire at each company And you know they all quickly adopt it for fear that being the last to adopt it might hurt their esg score But don't get too excited this opt out trend is I think rather limited It is it is it is um, not an option that will be offered for other occasions We can be fairly certain that door dash isn't going to be offering the chance to opt out of pride month promotions or you know Black history month span It's very unlikely that lee vise or et c will send an email that says we know pride month can be an extremely annoying time for you Which is why we want to know if you'd rather not receive pride month related emails Now this is something that will only be applied to mothers day Probably won't even extend to father's day as well simply because father's day is already mostly ignored You know, we've kind of opted out of that as a society in general Mother's day is the holiday that traditionally gets all the press with a great emphasis on Making sure that you shower your mother with gifts and attention and appreciation Father's day on the other hand is a time to throw a gift bag with a new pair of socks at your dad and say hey Happy father's day or whatever and then move on with your day Which I can say as a dad is how we prefer it. So I'm not complaining The point is that the opt out trend will be limited in scope. I think So why are the corporations doing this and why all of a sudden all at once The working theory among conservatives is that as we mentioned It's rooted in this kind of woke anti-family ideology The assumption is that it has something to do with the left's doctrines on gender and sexuality Mother's day presents a problem for these doctrines because motherhood presents a problem And that's why companies are slowly or not so slowly backing away from it But I actually don't think That that's the motivating factor here Mostly because the left doesn't believe that motherhood presents any problem for them on this front It does but they don't think that The gender ideologue doesn't want to abolish mother's day But rather appropriate it Which ultimately will have the same effect as abolishing it. Of course, we simply arrive at that destination from a different direction but So I don't think that's the reason That doesn't mean that the mother's day opt out trend isn't woke It certainly is just for different reasons In this case, we're told we're told the reason actually npr has an article on the subject about all these opt out emails And it explains this quote Many people struggle with mother's day and father's day for different reasons Perhaps they've lost parents or children confronted fertility issues or they have complicated relationships with family members As author and grief advocate Megan divine points out There are so many ways to lose a mother or to lose mothering The website upward he concurs quote Mother's day is an occasion of celebration and love for some while for others it is a painful reminder That reminds them of grief infertility issues or traumatic past Some major brands have started to realize this door dash pandora Mac k jewelers And several other companies have sent an email blast of their customers providing them with the option to stop any sort of mother's day branded emails or promotions Uh Quote what can be a wonderful time for some can be a difficult time for others jewelry brand pandora wrote in an april 2023 email to customers We completely understand if you'd prefer to opt out simply let us know and give us your email and so on This gesture brings relief to many for whom this day brings grief Quote as an infertile person who did years of medical treatment to get pregnant I can tell you this opt out stuff is not new and it's something appreciated by infertility and lost communities And I imagine by people who have lost parents or have bad relationships with them according to one twitter user So this is the point Mother's day is triggering for all the people who have experienced difficulties Related to their mothers or motherhood or fertility or child birth And somehow a a mother's day advertisement Is traumatic according to this logic and yet having to actively opt out of mother's day ads for dozens of different brands Is not traumatic That's totally incoherent of course, but the lack of coherence is another hallmark of wokeness You know, if my own if my own mother died government I would think it'd be much more emotionally taxing to go into my inbox And find all of the spam emails and open them and actively reply to them Asking them not to send me any any mother's day material because my mother is dead You know, I think that'd be much more difficult than simply just ignoring the spam And which goes to the spam folder anyway most of it Yet one way or another mother's day will come and people will celebrate And yes, if you've lost your mother or if you struggle with fertility or if you have a bad relationship with your mother or whatever else That celebration may conjure up some difficult emotions for you But it's not just mother's day that will have that effect When you're struggling with a serious challenge in your life where you're grieving over a loss or experiencing some other kind of deep emotional pain You'll find a universe suddenly chalk full of signs pointing back to those wounds And this is true when it comes to you know, very serious traumas like the loss of a loved one Um in your grief, you will find reminders of your loss everywhere you go It's also true of much less severe, but still significant pains like financial difficulties If you've ever if you've ever had serious money problems You know that when you have money problems, the world will constantly remind you of your money problems Especially around the holidays any holiday And even if there is nothing actively reminding you of whatever it is you're struggling with You still are stuck with your own mind Which is keenly aware of these struggles and constantly turning them over and dwelling on them No matter what else is going on in the outside world Wokeness wants to make us fragile by Encouraging us to shield ourselves from these difficult emotional experiences In fact, it tells us that we have the right to be shielded from them That the world should reorient itself so that we are not forced to think about things that make us uncomfortable The result is that we never learn to live with the hardships We only learned how to live around them avoiding them hiding from them That's how we become a country full of people who cannot cope with any discomfort whether big or small Always looking for the opt out option And unfortunately our society is run by institutions that are eager to provide it Which may make us more comfortable in the moment, but they won't help us become stronger better functioning people in the long run And that is why These companies and their mother's day opt out emails are today Cancelled Now do for this portion of shows move over to members block You can become a member today by using code wall shit checkout for two months free on all
