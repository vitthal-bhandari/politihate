    "text": " It's the Late Show Pancho with Stephen Colburn. Ladies and gentlemen, my first guest tonight stars in Queer Eye and is now a New York Times best-selling author with his new memoir Over the Top. Please welcome to the Late Show, Jonathan Maness. Lovely, happy here. Nice to see you again. You too. I really love the outfit. You do. That's really nice. Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry we keep it so cold in here. Oh, it's okay, you know. No worries. Well, people know you from Queer Eye, a show that's really about other people's lives and improving somebody else's life. But now you have written a memoir of your own life over the top. What's it like to tell your own story? It was enthralling, yet sometimes very terrifying. It was like, I think it's something the hardest project I've ever done, the most I've ever worked on something. What's terrifying about it? Because certainly you don't seem like a shrinking violet. You're willing to share. Me? Yeah, you don't hide your light under a bushel, Jonathan Maness. Well, you know, I think that, you know, because Queer Eye is not a show about, you know, the five of us, it's about the amazing people who we get to help. There is like not so much of an opportunity for me to tell like all of my back story. So this was really an opportunity for me to say, yes, I am this happy person who wants to like talk about our hair and where it should live and what colors we should think about and like where our eyebrows should do. But I was like, there's more. And I think that, you know, for me specifically, you know, talking about like, you know, my HIV status or surviving sexual abuse or, you know, having disordered eating issues, it's, I wanted to be able to talk about these things. Because I think that a lot of times people think that like if you have been through some hard times, like you can't be seen as positive or gregarious or happy anymore and I just wanted to show that honey, she's an onion with all sorts of layers. I like that honey, she's an onion. That's nice. So you do, you are very frank about addiction, depression, sexual abuse. And you say that you want people to learn from the book that how to bloom where you're planted. What do you mean by that? Well, I think, you know, my mom always said that to me. And it's basically like, it feels like the first cousin of like no matter where you go, there you are. And it's like we are ourselves wherever we go. And I think I realize that growing up, which I talk so much about growing up in my hometown, there were really difficult aspects of it. But always your hometown? Quincy Illinois. It's a gorgeous little place in Illinois. Yes, Illinois. But one for yes. So I just, I spent so much time growing up kind of being really very miserable except unless I was playing in my imagination, like gorgeous Olympic games or like eating powdered doughnuts or doing like actually eating powdered doughnuts or thinking about eating powdered doughnuts. Eating powdered doughnuts while doing like carpet figure skating routines between commercials of like America's next top model or like, you know, or misuniverse. Like, you know, whatever was on, whatever I could, you know, get the content that I needed as a child. It was a few and far in between. So, but really it was about taking myself in creating moments of joy, creating pockets of joy for me to be able to thrive and have fun in. And moments that really just weren't very fun. You talk in here about, you reveal in the book your HIV status, HIV positive status. What has been, what have been the more meaningful responses to that revelation? Well, there's been so much support just in general from so many people that, you know, really made me feel very seen and it's been, you know, I felt very embraced by a lot of the response that I got. I think also the most meaningful thing that's made me realize is the real lack of understanding that we still have around what it is to live with HIV now. And also the lack of social safety net for HIV positive people. When I had HIV initially, I was 25. I did not have a platform that I had now. There was like four different government programs that I had to like navigate by myself and, you know, figure out how to like, and I don't think I'm someone who doesn't take on information super well and me doing it at 25 dealing with what I was dealing with at the time. It made it really difficult for me to find a doctor. It made it very difficult for me to access medicine. And it's just that when people would say like, you know, Queer Eye Star comes out with devastating HIV diagnosis. It really should have been like Queer Eye Star comes out about the devastating ways that HIV positive people are still treated and stigmatized in this country when there's no need. We know that with antiretroviral therapy, people that achieve and maintain an undetectable viral load effectively have no chance of transmitting the virus actually. It's just something that I think people don't realize now. I think that a lot of people felt that HIV AIDS was no longer a threat to them and just something that we don't think about. But actually there is a rising threat of HIV in America and across the world because of increased stigma and like lack of access to testing sites like say at Planned Parenthood, when we're constantly defunding Planned Parenthood, Planned Parenthood last year gave over 740,000 HIV tests under the Title 10 program that the Trump and Pinsett administration just forced them out of. So I just really, I realized like just the huge lack of access that people have to information and the huge lack of support for people living with HIV in America. It is just so much harder than it needs to be. You say you were 25 when you found out? You were 25 when you found out? Yeah. How did that change your life? Other than obviously having to find the proper treatment to care for your positive status, how did it change like the way you looked at life to be facing that at 25? What was going on? He said there was a lot going on in your life that it was already difficult to deal with. What were those things? So I talked about it in the book, you know, I was struggling with drug addiction at the time and you know when you're trying to find your way out of substance abuse and then you realize that you're HIV positive, it can, you really have a choice there. It's like, am I going to go, what am I going to do? And so you know what was going on in my life at that time was, you know, I was born in 1987, right? So growing up in the late 80s, early 90s is a very, you know, clearly queer person from the time I was this big. You know, my family was very terrified of what HIV AIDS would mean for my future. I learned very young to be terrified of HIV AIDS and I talk about that in the book. And you know, when I was 25, the worst thing I ever thought could happen to me did. And what I realized was is that like with access to medication and a doctor, which when I found my first doctor in winter, I said, can I live to be 75? And she chuckled the stories in the book and it's hilarious. She said, oh honey, she was like, I'll keep you alive long enough to die of heart attack or cancer, like everybody else. And then my mom like, thudded off the chair behind me, like to the floor, just, I mean, I was like, oh, I just heard this like thud. And my mom was like, it's like mom, you probably shouldn't freak out. So again, that story is in the book. It's also super funny. So there's some sad stuff and there's funny stuff. You have dealt with a lot in your life, but you're incredibly positive and incredibly upbeat. Is that in any way ever a burden that people always expect you to be chipper, Jonathan Van Ness? Because you're a ray of sunshine. Do you ever not feel like it when people expect it from you? Yeah, you're damn right, I feel like that. You know, I'm just kidding. No, I do. But I think... I do. I think, but you know, it's like, I'm not Einstein. I'm not like a scientist. But you know, it's like that equal and opposite thing. So as happy and as loving and as amazing as I can be, I have other times where I'm equally stressed, equally as irritated. And I'm totally dealing with like finding my balance there. I think I had this amazing therapist at one time that was like, you know what you're like? And I was like, what? And she was like, this is you. And I was like, okay. And she was like, you know what you need to do? And I was like, what? She was like, you gotta learn to find like this. And I was like, balance? And she was like, it's balance. And I was like, oh my God. So, yeah. So it's like it's balance. You know. Yeah. Well, you, you, you, you, you groom and you, but you also help people with self-care on queer. I think they're one and the same. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I think the way that we take care of our insides is like reflective of our outsides, I think. And also Nancy Burtwhistle, you know, according to Netflix season one, winner of Great British Baking Challenge, told me on DM who I'm about to interview her when I go to one next week. I'm kind of not waiting to be her for so long. If you're not following her on Instagram, you really should be. It is so, beer. She's so cute. But anyway, she was like, you know, she was like, Jonathan grooming means something different in England. And I was like, ew. And then also my. What does grooming mean in England? It's like, like, it's like, it's like, it's not, it's a, it's like a grooming for hideous grooming. I don't even want to say it, but it's like grooming for abuse, honey. It's like, she was like, I'm so glad they don't call yourself a groomer. Any more, honey, she's like, you're a stylist. It's like, here, and I was like, oh, and also sidebar. I don't even know if this will make it, but this is so true. No idea. True story. So when I first decided about on this subtitles, like, my Roger into self-love. I was like, that's perfect. It is because it was like, it's kind of raw. It's pretty like, you know, but it's also like, it's like self-love. It's like, and it's a good. And then, um, when I was talking to the British editors the first time, they're like, so about this subtitle. And I was like, what? It's great, right? And they were like, well, my Roger is self-love. And the UK means like, self-love. So my raw journey to like, pleasuring yourself. Yes. Yes. And so I was like, well, it came. I'm turning into a raw journey if you take it to hell. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't know about all these British, you know. You should have known that one. I didn't know. I didn't know. That doesn't need a translation, you know. Really? No, you keep your ear to the ground about politics. Oh, yeah. You're about politics. I'm very tuned in. We have a clip here. You endorsed Elizabeth Warren. And she called you. She did. And both of you recorded this phone call. And I'd love to show the audience that if you don't mind. Jim? How is it going to warrant? How are you? I'm good. How are you? I'm good. I'm having such a crazy day. Go save America. We got to go in also to like, we also really got to get that Mitch out of there because we're going to mention that Kamala hates the worst of, we got to take the Senate. We're going to take Congress back. We already have Congress. We got to see. Let's do it all. And then we got to get to the White House and we're just going to sort everything out. So you go to America and we're going to go keep doing these interviews. I can't believe you took your time to talk to me and I'll talk to you soon. Okay, talk to you soon. Be strong out there. Thank you. I will you too. Bye bye. Bye bye. I feel the same way. We're out there sometimes. We've got to go in here in a minute but I want to ask you about this is very important. Right now the Supreme Court is they just heard oral arguments for Title VII yesterday. It's a very important topic to you and to other Americans. What should we know about it? Well in 1964 we passed the Civil Rights Act and Title VII and the Civil Rights Act said that federally you can't discriminate on the basis of sex. And so the Obama administration had said that and you know you can Google this fact check it like to your own research but the Obama administration had been interpreting that and I think up until that point through the Obama administration that had been extended to people to transgender folks and to gay and lesbian folks bisexual whatever just you know the whole crew all of us. And basically William Barr the Attorney General and then the Trump administration filed this brief and said you know Congress at any time can rewrite any section of any law of any statute to cover more people to you know to choose to include more people. And the crazy part about that is that the Equality Act which the House passed a few months ago actually addresses that and it reopened the very act that sex and that Title VII is attached to the Civil Rights Act. So the Civil Rights Act of 1964 has been open to add LGBTQ Americans into it and that is the very thing that the Trump administration already said that they would not sign on to Mitch McConnell won't bring it up to a vote so the thing that's so troubling to me personally about this brief is that we have this power grab in Washington where we have a democratically elected body at the House of Representatives that is doing their part to pass laws that they see fit and Mitch McConnell won't even bring them up to a vote to be debated against or to be debated on. And so now because we cannot pass the Equality Act with the present leadership in you know this in force now they brought this up to the Supreme Court and with Kavanaugh and Gorsuch we can only know you know what's going to happen we don't expect a ruling until any time between January and June of 2020. So they're hearing oral arguments this week but there's three cases and yeah there's a transgender case there's two cases based off of sexual orientation and it's just a huge huge issue for LGBTQ Americans. Depending on how they rule it could then be legal to fire anybody based on the sexual orientation or their sexual identity. And the way I understand this is they could yeah absolutely but like as President Obama said like don't boo vote you know. I think next year it's so important that if you consider yourself an ally I think it's really we're past the time where you can say you know I don't watch the news it stresses me out it's like don't watch the news then go on Twitter like talk to somebody about it like we have to keep our eyes and ears open because right now you know we are detaining asylum seeking families we are separating families at the southern border based off of HIV status we have 18 trans people so far that we know of that have been murdered this year for five years straight we have steadily increasing hate crimes we are currently in so much animosity and toxicity in this country that people are being attacked every day so we absolutely have to talk we have to keep our eyes open and I think it's kind of like that you know metaphor in Dante's peak remember with with Pierce Brosnan remember I don't I don't actually remember Dante's Dante's peak because when they want to evacuate that poor town by the volcano honey and no one will listen to the mayor and then they bring in Pierce Brosnan who I believe is the gene the geologist probably and so he's like you know if you put a frog in the boiling water which we should never do but if you put a frog in boiling water it will jump right out but if you put a frog in the room temp water and boil a honey she'll stay there and I fear that we are the frog and the room temperature water of America we're boiling Frog soup. Frog soup. Well there's so much there's so much more to talk about please come again please have me anytime I was such an honor. Oh lovely to see you. Thank you very much. Good to see you Jonathan. Over the top the book available now Jonathan Madmass everybody. Coming up town France. Hey everybody welcome back to the late show our next guest tonight is the fashion expert you know from the Emmy award winning show Queer Eye his new show is called Next in Fashion please welcome back to the late show Tan France. Hi. Nice to have you back. I'm so happy to be back. I love this place. Oh well they evidently like you too. Thanks. It's nice to see you. Thanks. How you been? Happy 2020. Happy 2020. Does it feel just too soon for that? Last year was over like in a hobby. Oh it seemed eternal to me. Oh. Last time we were here we had a lovely time talking and you let me do something you said you never let anybody do which is and I'm not asking to do it again tonight but I ran my fingers through your unbelievably luxurious hair. Very kind. Thank you. Did you know that you won't know you are literally the only person who's ever when you're putting his through my hair and I'm talking to anybody not just on TV like my husband is not allowed to touch my hair. It's not allowed to touch my hair. Wow. That just shows the lack of respect I have for him compared to you. It's fantastic. How do you stop him? Is it in the prenup? Either with a prenup. That is just an invitation. He just knows like Devoth is imminent if he decides to try and touch my hair. I like to look a certain way for him. Well how were your holidays? Did you have a good break? It was the most heavenly experience. Literally it was a lovely like I did. Did you go like someplace fancy? I did my sofa like my sofa is my favorite place on the planet. I bet it's very fancy. It's just nice but it was just nice to be home for two weeks and not work. I love my job very very much but it was just nice to have a little break. Let me ask something about you and your fellow queer eye guys. Do you guys ever talk about Marie Kondo? Do you guys ever dish about her because she's another lifestyle person who's very hot right now. When are we not talking about Marie Kondo? We're obsessed with her. Is there a chance of a crossover? I'm not going to say no. I would love to. Who knows? We have asked. We've actually asked many times. She's the most lovely person. Have you met her in real life? I had her on right here and I joined her cult. I joined her cult. She's like an elf. She is wonderful. I met her a few times at events and she seems to get scared by me because I speak really fast and I get very excited. I'm like oh my gosh I love you so much and I try and lift her. It's just not good. Don't do that. What do you make of her style? Oh my gosh she looks so incredible always. Always so simple. So chic. Yeah she's so chic. Beautiful. Okay do you remember, cast yourself back now to your childhood. Your first encounter with fashion. What's the first memory you have of it? So I started out in fashion in my granddad's factory when I was like seven. It wasn't child labor I wasn't getting paid. He was a really nice friend. It wasn't child labor because you weren't getting paid. There's another word for that. It's worse than child labor. Yeah. You can't say that word. And I loved it so much. And I got to see. What were you making? Like what was the sort of? Janum. So we were making Janum. And so I got to see something go from just a bolt of fabric to an actual piece of quote. I could make a denim jacket by the time I was 13 which is actually very, very difficult. However so my granddad died a few years ago. I loved him very, very much. And I never understood why he got rid of it at 13. And I just assumed it wasn't a bean dune very well so he just got rid of it. That wasn't the reason. I wrote in my book. So I wrote a book recently. And I wrote in there. This is where I got my first start in fashion. I used to make denim all the time because my granddad had a factory that made denim for Disney. And then my sister read it and she, my book and she was like you've got to stop telling that story. I was like why? She was like you were too young to remember why the factory closed down. We were making knockoffs. Wow. And I think, I know. And they, and I don't know if you know this, they have lawyers. They do. I think the statute of limitations is okay. And also he's passing me like what can you do? Like, don't nothing is beyond Mickey. He'll get him. Okay, you got a new show. I'm going to get to the new show. It's on Netflix called Next in Fashion with your host with Alexa Chung. That's nice. What's next? What's next in fashion? Fashion me up a little bit here. What I need to do. Let me tell you two things really quickly. I have, this is the first show I've done away from the boys. I love my boys very much. But Alexa Chung is formidable. She's incredible. And the show is super super exciting. I promise you're going to love it. Like it is. It's a really fun show. And the designers are incredible. And then as far as what's in style, can we talk about men's wear real quick? I hope. Okay. Do you remember last time when I was here, you wearing a very peculiar tie? It was a sports game. It was, I don't, I don't understand what's in it. You had a very, very kooky tie on. And I thought that that was your fashion show. But I know you dress incredibly well. I've seen you many, many times. You always look very, very nice. But there are, there's something that's fashionable nowadays that you haven't started wearing yet. Is this it? Because they have something back here. May I show it? Yeah. I would, yeah. Okay. Let me explain. Let me, yes. Can I call this? Okay. Okay. By the way, I by the way, you better watch out. Thank you. You better watch out. Disney, Disney is coming come after you again because you stole this from the Lion King. What am I, why am I wearing it? Let me explain. So I know it's not for everybody and maybe not for you either. However, what I will say is this, animal print. Animal print is a huge trend for 2020. Animal print. It was between this and a solid satin jacket, which I thought was possibly even more. Yeah. Sure. But listen, let me say this. If you were to take off his tie and just have like his shirt buttoned up, hit look, she'd be able to wear a patent jacket or no? I actually, they said he's going to want you to wear a pattern jacket. And I said, what about my pattern jacket that I wore to the Met last year with my wife? I do remember. Look at that. Actually, I do remember. Come on. You look tough. You look tough. You look way ahead of you. You look great in France. You did. However, what I will say is that you look super, super hot. Thank you. But your wife. Looked hot. Overshadows. Exactly. As she always does. You look very good. Obviously, I get to keep this. You can keep it so you can burn it later in a ceremony. Yes. Lovely to see you again. Good to see you. Happy New Year.
