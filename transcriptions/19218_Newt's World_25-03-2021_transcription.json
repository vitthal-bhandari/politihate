We'll talk to the biggest names and politics, news, entertainment, and get to the truth of the issues that affect your family and have some fun along the way. It's the Carol Markowitz Show, part of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Podcast Network. New episodes drop every Monday and Thursday on the iHeart Radio app, Apple Podcasts, or wherever you get your podcasts. On this episode of Newt's World, Amelia Earhart Hart and her crew at Oakland, California, ready for her great aerial adventure, Around the World Flight by Wear the Equator. A journey no pirate has yet attempted. The machine is heavy with extra petrol and so the takeoff is the critical number. A long run on the ground and the slow rise into the air and she's away. We're continuing our series learning about exceptional Americans with a look at Amelia Earhart's life and legacy. Born in 1897 in Kansas, Amelia Mary Earhart was the first female aviator to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. But her story from a tumultuous childhood filled with many family moves and then in her early 20s, finding out she'd love to fly and actually working hard to make a career out of it makes her truly an exceptional American. This is Amelia Earhart's story. On July 24, 1897, Amelia Earhart was born in Atchison, Kansas to parents Amelia Amy Otis and Samuel Edwin Stanton Earhart. During her childhood, Amelia worked with her maternal grandparents during the school year and spent summers with her parents in Kansas City. Amelia spent her childhood outside climbing trees, sledding and hunting against her grandmother's wishes. In 1908, Amelia moved back with her parents full time in Des Moines, Iowa. Here she sees an airplane for the first time at the Iowa State Fair. She in a later interview said she was unimpressed by the plane saying there's a thing of rusty wire and wood and looked not at all interesting. Between 1910 and 1915, there were difficult years with the Earhart family. Amelia's grandmother, who raised her, died in 1911. Her father struggled with alcoholism, lost his job and checked into a hospital for a month to try to rehabilitate himself. After the family moved to St. Paul, Minnesota in 1913, Amelia's father was unable to find a job and continued struggling with alcoholism. So, Amelia's mother left him and moved both Amelia and her younger sister to Chicago. In June 1919, Amelia graduated from Hyde Park High School in Chicago, excelling in science. However, she had trouble making friends. Between 1916 and 1918, Amelia attended O'Gon's School, a finishing school outside of Philadelphia. She excelled in her studies and became vice president of her class. However, she did not graduate op-ings instead to volunteer at Toronto's Spadina Military Hospital as a nurse for wounded World War I soldiers. Between 1919 and 1920, Amelia entered the pre-med program at Columbia University, but then decided to leave to rejoin her parents who got back together and were living in Los Angeles. December 28, 1920, Amelia attended an air show in Long Beach, California with her father, and Frank Hawks, who later gained fame as an air racer, gave her her first ride in an airplane. The ride would change Airheart's life. She later recalled, by the time I'd got two or three hundred feet off the ground, I knew I had to fly. January 3, 1921, Amelia had her first flying lesson with pilot Nita Snuck at Kinderfield near Long Beach, California. To pay for these lessons, Amelia worked at a variety of jobs, including truck driver, photographer, and stenographer. Six months later, she saved enough money to purchase her first airplane, a yellow-kinner-airster-byplane she named Kanneri. December 15, 1921, Amelia passed her flying license test given by the National Aeronautic Association. Two days later, she flew on the Pacific Coast Ladies Derby in Pasadena. On October 22, 1922, Amelia set an unofficial altitude record for female pilots after flying to 14,000 feet. On May 16, 1923, Amelia's issued an international pilot's license, becoming the 16th woman to earn it. In 1924, she took a break from flying after her parents got divorced, driving with her mother from California to Massachusetts. In 1927, mounting bills forced Amelia to sell her plane and work as a teacher and then a social worker, teaching English to Syrian and Chinese immigrants. In 1927, Amelia also joined the Boston chapter of the National Aeronautic Association. Between June 17 and 18, 1928, Amelia's thrust into the spotlight after she, pilot Wilmer Stoltz and co-pilot Louis Gordon departed from Newfoundland in a tri-motor seaplane and landed in Wales over 20 hours later. Amelia, however, did not believe she deserved the acclaim from being the first woman passenger on a transatlantic flight because as she put it, Stoltz did all the flying had to.

During the summer of 1928, Amelia published a book about the flight titled 20 hours 40 minutes. She quickly became a celebrity after a book tour and she began to endorse products like Lucky Strike Cigarettes and Modern Air Air Heart luggage. August 1929, Amelia buys another plane, a single engine Lockheed Vega and participates in the women's air derby race from Santa Monica to Cleveland coming in third place. November 2nd 1929, Amelia helped found the 99s Inc. the first organization for women aviators, becoming its first president in 1931, holding that position for two years. She used her celebrity status to promote the growth of American commercial airlines. July 5th 1930, Amelia set the women's world flying speed record of 181.8 miles per hour. Between 1930 and 1935, she set seven more women's speed and distance records. On February 7th 1931, Amelia married George Palmer Putnam. However, she refused George's proposal six times before she said yes. Being wary of the institutional marriage, she emphasized her marriage as a partnership with dual control. In 1932, Amelia wrote her second book, The Fun of It. Between May 20th and May 21st 1932, Amelia became the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean flying from Newfoundland to Northern Ireland. Prior to flying solo across the Atlantic, Amelia addressed the nation. This is much easier to fly the Atlantic Ocean now than it was a few years ago. I expect to be able to do it in my lifetime again. This earned her the distinguished flying cross from the U.S. Congress, the cross of night of the Legion of Honor from the French government, and the gold medal of the National Geographic Society from President Hoover, becoming the first woman to receive this award. Here's Amelia explaining her flight path and the troubles she encountered while flying her first transatlantic solo flight. I took off the famous Harbor Grace runway at dusk about 7.30, I flew for a couple of hours while sunset lasted and then two more hours as the moon came up over a bank of clouds. I had fair weather for four hours. Then I ran into a storm, which was one of the most severe I have ever been in. I had milled around in the storm here for probably an hour and with difficulty kept my course. I had been troubled with my exhaust manifold burning through all night. A weld broke shortly after I left Harbor Grace and I could see the damage increasing as the night wore on. I found specific thunderstorms probably three or four hundred miles off the coast of Ireland. I believe I saw land first about the middle. I decided to come down anyway in the best available pasture. I got down without any trouble and taxied to the front door. I was surprised. Farmer. Between August 24th and 25th 1932, Amelia became the first woman to fly solo across the North American continent and back. In 1933, Amelia visited the White House and befriended First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. In 1933, Amelia also flew across North America for the second time, breaking her flight time record. In 1934, Amelia received the Harmon Trophy for America's outstanding air woman for the third time in a row. Here's Amelia in a 1935 radio address on a woman's place in science and how science has changed the lives of women. This modern world of science and invention is a particular interest to women. For the lives of women have been more affected by its new horizons than those of any other group. Profound and stirring as have been accomplishments in the remote of fields of pure research, it is in the home that the applications of scientific achievement have perhaps been most far reaching. And it is through changing conditions there that women have become the greatest beneficiaries in the modern scheme. Science has released them from much of the age-old luxury connected with the process of living. Candle dipping, weaving, and crude methods of manufacturing necessities are things of the past for an increasing majority. Today, light, heat, and power may be obtained by pushing buttons and cunningly manufactured and appealing products of all the worlds are available at the house by store. On January 11, 1935, Amelia became the first person to fly solo from Honolulu, Hawaii to Oakland, California. Between April 19 and 20, 1935, Amelia flew solo from Los Angeles to Mexico City. And on May 8, 1935, Amelia flew solo from Mexico City to New York City. In between these flights, Amelia worked as a career counselor to women at Purdue University. July 1936, Purdue financed a new plane for Amelia, a Lockheed Electra 10E. Amelia and her husband began to plan for her world trip by raising money and consulting with advisors, mechanics, and navigators. March 17, 1937, Amelia and her navigator, Fred Noonan, along with Captain Harry Manning and stunt pilot Paul Mans, fly the first leg of the trip from Oakland, California to Honolulu, Hawaii in 15 hours and 47 minutes. Boring into the Oakland airport, she brings to a triumphant finish her 2400 mile hop from Hawaii after 18 hours in the air. 10,000 cheer the end of the aftercoat flight as the lady Lindy slides into a perfect landing with two records. The first woman to fly the Pacific and the first person to fly it solo. She receives one of the most tumultuous greetings ever accorded a flyer. Roses to Amelia and the products of the world to a veteran of flights that have shown the way for aviation's progress. It's her most brilliant chapter in a 16-year aviation career. How does it feel to fly both oceans, Miss Earhart? Well, it was very interesting to me to fly in southern waters rather than in the north. On the Atlantic flight, I had ice conditions and general storm. On this flight, really no bad weather at all except the fuel and rain squalls. I saw the moon and stars lost to the night. Of course, in both flights, I was very glad to see land. On June 1, 1937, Amelia departed from Miami, Florida with the plan of traveling from west to east. Fred Noonan is her only crew member this time. They complete nearly 22,000 miles of the flight, stopping in South America, Africa, India, and New Guinea. July 2, 1937, Amelia and Fred Noonan depart from Laos heading to Lowland Island, a tiny island in the Pacific. Amelia and Noonan cannot find the island and lose radio contact with the Coast Guard. In the official report, the U.S. Navy reported that Earhart and Noonan ran out of fuel and crashed in the Pacific. They disappeared over the Pacific Ocean. Pacific, on the last lap of her magnificent flight round the world by way of the equator, Miss Amelia Earhart was lost in mid-ocean. On the 2,500 mile hop to Holland Island, she was reported missing. President Roosevelt issued a massive search for them, and Amelia's husband finances his own search until October 1937, but their efforts are unsuccessful. Amelia was declared legally dead on January 5, 1939. The New York Post Hi, it's Carol Markowitz.

There are several theories about what really happened to your heart. The first series a crash landed in the ocean after running out of fuel. In the official report, the US Navy, after a lengthy and costly search, concluded on July 18, 1937 that Earhart and Noonan ran out of fuel and crashed in the Pacific. According to the radio logs, Earhart indicated that she thought they were near the island and were running low on gas. However, a photograph taken in October, 1937, three months after the disappearance could point to a different explanation. That they landed on Nicomoraro island about 350 nautical miles from their intended destination. The US Coast Guard received multiple reports from radio operators that they heard messages over the next five days after her disappearance that could have been from Earhart. It was not confirmed that it was from Earhart or Noonan. Betty Clanche, a teenager in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported that she heard a voice saying, this is Amelia Earhart, help me on her father's shortwave radio a few days after she disappeared. Her father reported it to the Coast Guard. Those messages stopped on July 13, 1937. In 1940, bones, men and women's shoes, and a navigation device was discovered near the remains of a campsite on the island. The bones were shipped to Fiji where they were later lost. There are other less believed theories, including that they were captured and then executed by the Japanese, or that the Navy faked the crash landing so they had an excuse to search the area without suspicion. In Earhart and Noonan lived the rest of their lives under fake names. However, the plane has never been recovered, and it remains a mystery to what really happened to Amelia Earhart. I think the combination of her mysterious disappearance, the notion that she was trying to fly around the world, all of the different things she had done to pioneer a woman's role in American life, pioneering an aviation, pioneering in the way in which she counseled young ladies, pioneering in the book she wrote, created a romantic mystique. And I think in a way, her name, Amelia Earhart, works really well to create this sense of mystery. The result was that she was truly an exceptional American in almost every sense of the word. She did a amazing range of things, taking care of the wounded, for example, in World War I was in passing, just one part of a very complicated and very interesting life. She was very determined to live out of life as a pilot, and she managed to do so in a way that virtually no woman of her generation could match. So I think it's fair to say that she is truly an extraordinary American, and that she is somebody who carved a path that both men and women could look at with great admiration, and that she was truly a romantic, exciting, and mysterious figure.
