    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show podcast. Welcome back and everybody. Second hour of play and Buck starts right now and you've got a lot to get to. First off, there are a number of developments in the law fair offensive against Donald Trump. Okay, a number of news items. Some of them, I think even got a little bit lost in the last couple of days in the news cycle because of the shock of Tucker Carlson's removal from air. We're still looking at that story closely. By the way, it is not clear. One thing Clay to notice from this is how many news organizations are putting out stories that are at odds with each other, which means they're running stories that can't all be true, but they don't care because they're just throwing whatever they can at the wall about the Tucker. It's not even clear that he's leaving Fox for good. I don't know what's going to happen. No one really knows what's going to happen exactly yet. So we're watching that one, but a couple of things. First of all, today, you have the expectation here shortly of I believe it could be the next couple of hours. E. Jean Carroll, who is the accuser of Donald Trump. She is suing him in civil court for a rape that she says Donald Trump committed against her in the 1990s. Now there, there is a change in New York state law that gave a one year effectively erasure of the statute of limitations for certain sexual crimes. And and this is we can talk by the way about this, this notion of getting rid of for a civil case, for example, a statute of limitations. How can you prove your innocence about something like this? If you're Donald Trump, for something that happened over 30 years ago, how are you so what evidence can you marshal one way or the other in your defense? There is a principle behind the statute, by the way, and they have waived it in New York and it is being used to attack Trump. So she's testifying today, CNN all over that story. No surprise. They're going to be covering that very closely. They initially backed off that story, Clay, if you recall, because she went on Anderson Cooper show on CNN and it got very uncomfortable the way that she was talking not not uncomfortable for Trump supporters. It looked like you had somebody who was not mentally well, giving an interview. That was the takeaway from the interview she did with Anderson Cooper. Everybody saw it was very clear. That's why she stopped being put on CNN. But she's back now. Civil suit. Okay, that's one. Second thing is the prosecutors bringing charges against Donald Trump or that brought charges, I should say, they brought the indictment for the hush money payment. We all know the basic background of this, right? The most non crime crime any of us have ever heard of. Clay, they are demanding a protective order to prevent Trump from being able to talk about aspects of the case, evidence in the case, etc. They are demanding silence from Trump while they put him through this Kafka esque absurdity in New York. So that's going on. Third thing third. This is all Trump legal stuff going on right now. And I think it's important to give it all in its totality. The district attorney in the Fanny Willis who was the district attorney in Fulton County, Georgia, says that a determination will be made this summer, you know, right in the middle of the Republican primary, right in the middle of the election season, really kicking off this summer as to whether they will bring conspiracy to commit election fraud and reco charges, racketeering racketeer influence corrupt organization usually used against mafia people against Trump. Serious criminal charges are thinking about those are the three for right now, Clay. And there's more too. But what do you make of it all? So let's start in reverse order. The Atlanta area, Fulton County suit, potentially the charges. But she didn't even say just the summer. I believe she said sometime between July, August or September, she's still giving herself a 90 day window to decide when those July 1st and September 1st is the is the summer. The New York Times headline is charges would be announced this summer. So that's, I mean, but, but I mean, think about where we are for her setting the table. We're not even through April yet. She isn't saying we're not going to make a choice in May or June. She basically is laying out July, August or September still as the potential timeframe. We're still talking about 120 days or so that she's giving herself to make a determination in that case. Now, maybe it comes sooner, but I thought that was interesting. Second part of this, be careful of the traps that are being laid. So in the Alvin Bragg case, in particular, we have laid it out for all of you. This is the New York City BS claim that was brought. We still don't know what the underlying felony is to justify raising misdemeanors to felonies. But we do need to echo all the time. Alvin Bragg took office and 52% of the time he has turned actual felony charges into misdemeanors over half. In this situation, he's elevating 34 different misdemeanors to a felony. He still is not explaining the legal justification to make that decision. But we saw this laid out a little bit, but I think this is part and parcel of the larger context here, Buck. They're trying to put Trump in a corner where they can get him on some sort of contempt of court charge. Just I want everybody to think about this because absolutely true. If they come out and say, you're not allowed to talk about the criminal proceedings in this case, they aren't just trying to restrict Trump's ability to publicly combat illegitimate charges. They are trying to set a trap for him, where if he does address those issues, and I think everybody out there, regardless of how much of a Trump fan you are, would acknowledge that Trump likes to talk and wants to tell his side of the story more so than many presidents we've ever seen, maybe any president we've ever seen. They are laying out a trap where he could be in contempt of court on BS illegitimate charges, where the punishment from the court for speaking out against these illegitimate charges could be more significant than the potential punishments of the court case itself. So just keep that in mind. And then on the, the allegation that is currently pending in a civil context, what I would say is this is another example of a rigged jury. We'll see what happens here. But my concern, if I were Trump would be, you could get a runaway jury that decides to pop him with a substantial verdict for something that is not legitimate. So, so I think it's not even about whatever the monetary damages are that they will declare. My friends, we all, we need to see what's going on here. There's the big, the big 30,000 foot picture, which I'll get to in a second, but just specifically on this e-gene Carroll situation. This is all about moving the goal posts to destroy Trump and Trumpism through the legal system. The indictment came down. As we said, that was remar, everyone was saying, crossing the Rubicon, crossing the Rubicon, because now all these other look at, we were right, by the way, that was just the beginning. Once that decision was made, now there's all these other pieces that are moving simultaneously on the e-gene Carroll piece of this. And I don't, I mean, we could play what she said to Anderson Cooper and you could make your own decisions. Maybe we, maybe we should pull it because they decided no more, no more of this person on CNN because it hurt their credibility based on what she said on air in the interview about the situation. But put that aside for a second. Clay, they're going to find him guilty in New York. It's a civil case. So it's preponderance of evidence. It's not beyond a reasonable doubt. He'll be liable for damages for people out there. They're like, they're just going to find him liable. Yeah. They're going to find him liable for damages for raping a woman. That's the whole point, right? It's not about the money. It's that in a court, people heard that Trump raped a woman and that they're going now, we can all see the legality of this. But the point is to stain him with that, right? To undermine everything about him as a person so that now going into, they'll say, well, I mean, a court, as a court said, Donald Trump is a rapist. That's what they're going to do. If that by the way, maybe they don't, by the way, to Clay's point, maybe they don't get that jerk. Maybe the jury realizes how unfair and insane this is. It's a New York jury right now. 90% Democrat folks. Do you really think you? By the way, who wants to be on that jury who speaks up in defense of sanity and truth and then taking a step back from this for a moment, taking a step away from this for a moment. You'd want to ask what is more likely that this is a concerted effort by the apparatus to use the legal system in every way possible in every jurisdiction in every state. And we still could see something federal Clay as we've talked about to destroy Donald Trump or that he went the first 78 years of his life without breaking any criminal laws without sexually assaulting anybody without doing any of these things he's accused of. And suddenly he became the worst criminal since Al Capone. Which of these things is more likely? I would also add on the layering here, Buck, because I think it's not only the law fair being used against Trump to try to destroy him simultaneously. The same court system is protecting Joe Biden and his family from any consequences from their far more significant criminal related enterprises. Right. Whatever you think of Trump right now, right? Whatever you think of Trump, what he has done, even if you accept everything that Alvin Bragg said is true, is so far based on the criminal charges against him, a pinprick of what Hunter Biden did that we all saw on that laptop. And it's not only that Trump is being attacked. If the entire judicial system had been mobilized, Buck were effectively Democrats and Republicans were just going to war with each other through the courts. And everybody in politics was taking on hits and casualties and everything else. No, no, no, that's not what's going on. The entire judicial system has been utilized, mobilized and and is pushing forward on attack against Trump. Simultaneously, Biden basically has the entire judicial system as a shield. Yes, he isn't being protected by the same people attacking this is a critical point you're making. And this is true weaponization of a judicial system, or this is true weaponization of the bureaucracy, right? In countries, Clay, where all of a sudden the Republic or the democracy starts to die, it's not just that they go after the opposition to the regime is that the regime is invulnerable in the courts. That's how you get a truly autocratic and frightening situation. This is also how you get coups in general, because it's one thing if you lose an election and you have to, it's it's disappointing. It's humiliating. It's it's a defeat on an epic scale to be that close to the presidency and lose. But you still have your freedom. You're still probably going to be able to have a really good life. You see a lot of these other countries. It's not just about losing the election. It's that if you lose, your political opposition is going to put you in cuffs and they are going to come after you and your family for the rest of your life. That that is exactly what Democrats are doing that has never occurred before in the history of the United States to Donald Trump to members of his family while simultaneously protecting far more severe criminal transgressions from Biden and his own family. And I do I do think it's so important to understand and to remember the viciousness and the radicalism with which the Democrat machine attacks those who stand in its way when we're now discussing Republican leadership and presidential primaries and all this stuff. On the right, we are on the same team and can't lose sight of that as you stare across the ideological battlefield and see people who don't just want to beat you at the ballot box. If you speak out of turn too much, if you say something they don't like, if you stand for something that stands in the way of their power, they want to lock you up. They really do they want to lock up your leaders and they want to lock you up to got to remember this.

Anderson Cooper interviewing Donald Trump's accuser about rape in 2019 in 2019. She says most people think rape is sexy and they have a fantasy with it. Just listen. Most people think of rape as a I mean it is a violent assault it is not I think most people think of rape as being sexy. Let's take a short break. The fantasies we've got to take a quick break if you can stick around with talk Martin. I want to get out of there real fast. So this is a woman who went on CNN. Regardless of what you think of her otherwise and said I think most women think of rape basically as really sexy. I'm going to be honest with you. I'm going to be honest with you. I think most people out there in our audience do not share that opinion right and you know that Anderson Cooper just had alarm bells going off in his mind. Now we don't know what this woman's testimony has been like in the court proceeding. But if you wonder wait this is a woman who accused Donald Trump of rape. Why hasn't she been circulating more in media. It's because of an interview like that even CNN and MSNBC are like we can't put this woman on air and risk what she might say. So I'm glad we played that book. Did just so everyone understands. She also publicly lobbied for the passage of the law that has allowed her to bring this suit way past the statute of limitations against Donald Trump. And she said change the law and now she can go after Trump. Trump says this is not true right. I think it's worth admitting or sharing the fact that he says he never did anything with this woman. And I think not in the best way that Trump could defend himself. I think he said she's not my type which I mean is not an ideal defense either. But that I believe I remember correctly buck was the way that Trump responded to these allegations.

If you got any thoughts especially for some of the lawyers out there or people have worked in the court as a judge etc about what they're trying to do to Trump here. I think that it's very likely you're going to see Georgia criminal charges against him and then in addition to that I think it is very likely that they will use that as a stepping stone to some kind of federal charge. I think they're going to go all the way now that's what they think is going on. I wanted we'll get to the comma the sound by the second. Yes. Clay wants to weigh in on the legal. I think we should say on the legal remember when they requested this trial January of 2024 in New York they are this is this is what I think is going on they are trying to stack it so that effectively Trump would have to be in a courtroom for almost the entirety of 2024 right because if they bring the charges in Georgia they can't have that trial simultaneous to the trial in New York and then if they bring federal charges he is trying to run a presidential campaign from a courtroom and now think about a basic principle within the courtroom or rule in the courtroom is you know as a defendant you are presented not you know shackled and you know dragging like the old member they used to have the ball and chain thing on the on the ankle and you know and and a bright orange jumpsuit no no you show up you get to wear a suit you get to present yourself a certain way because the optics of it can matter to a jury every every defense attorney knows this they'll all talk about it I watch enough law in order to see this okay think about the optics for not this audience because this audience knows that this is all a scam it's a sham it's rigged and they're trying to destroy Trump think of the optics for the independent and swing voters in the six key states of Trump in courtroom after courtroom after courtroom in the election year facing charges that sound and are in some cases if this all goes through serious felonies that's what they're going they don't have to win they're just going to try to muddy them up and and create a mess right I mean I think that's the game plan pretty clearly buck fun story here building on the optics that you talked about you get to put a trial on I knew a trial attorney not married he would wear a wedding ring for jury trials because jurors consider married men more trustworthy than single men so when you talk about just how the optics will play this dude would get a wedding ring single guy would wear a wedding ring at trial because when he walked in front of the jury that gold band flashes and he's considered especially by women less threatening as a married man than he would be more trustworthy than he would be as a single man so we want to open this up to you if you see how this is playing out you want to add some analysis in particularly for the former prosecutors current or former prosecutors defense attorneys judges out there if you got anything for us 800 282 282 now we promise this I claim I doesn't think this clip is as good as I do I think this is maybe great I think it's fantastic I think Kamala has set the standard for stupidity so incredibly uh like she's been so bad and so dumb that it's hard for her to exceed what she's already done you know she's able to sound like a person who is desperately trying to sound profound and intellectual in a way that it's beyond parody sometimes like you couldn't do a better version of the Kamala Harris you know method the way that she approaches these things all right here we go I can't even do a justice without you listening to it I think this is maybe the best Kamala moment of all time but you know that's debatable here you go play clip one so I think it's very important as you have heard from so many incredible leaders for us at every moment in time and certainly this one to see the moment in time in which we exist and are present and to be able to contextualize it to understand where we exist in the history and in the moment as it relates not only to the past but the future that's the bad sorry I think that's the yeah this moment in time of the moment in time we're in at this time on the timeline of the moment clay we need to know where we are at this time I shared this video book on social and I when I share a funny video I actually I a lot of times don't pay attention to mentions because it's not that worthy but when I share something that is funny I definitely want to see people react to the humor and the best response that I saw here was if you just showed me this quote I'm paraphrasing one of the commenters he said if you just showed me this quote I would 100% believe it was Michael Scott from the office yes which is really funny you take away the female voice and you just wrote this whole quote out it does sound like something that Michael Scott would have said on the office when he's trying to sound profound for those of you who are office fans and he's sitting doing his his interviews with the with the camera this is a vintage Michael Scott Michael Scott clip now interesting to I think worth bringing this up because just because this is another moment where you realize this Kamala can't win guys she cannot win an election because she will have to win some independence Democrats are not enthusiastic about her she was a bottom tier despite what she said a bottom tier candidate in the Democrat prime or maybe okay mid tier candidate in the Democrat primary back in in 2019 2020 here though is something I thought this was interesting they're asking people because you know I've been saying this all along the strategy here is Biden is the bridge for Kamala to just be dropped in without facing voters as the first black female president and of course a Democrat and here she is here she is saying I'm sorry here is Karine Jean-Pierre saying that Kamala Harris well will Biden commit to serving his full term let's look at this play 10 the president plan to serve all eight years I'm not I'm just not going to get ahead of the president that's something for him to decide I'm just not going to get ahead of it and we're there's a 2024 campaign anything related to that I would refer you to that yeah clay that's an easy one by the way just say just say of course he's going to serve all eight just just say it right except we all know there's no way he's serving all you know there's no way he's making it through another four years I would place a sizable bet that he will hand the baton over he will pass the torch he will give the presidency to Kamala Harris and that'll be the act you know his greatest legacy right there that's the whole that's the game here's what I can't believe about this buck on the day that he announces come look Karine Jean-Pierre lives all the time how could she not handle this question unless there's actually this is my thought when I saw it unless there's actually discussions already occurring in the White House about Joe Biden passing the baton to Kamala Harris right like this is what I mean she lies for a living this is easy one she wasn't able to handle this lie and remember as Joe Biden has now announced the announced yesterday in that stupid video but the entire premise of Joe Biden's campaign in 2020 it was implicit it wasn't stated but it was certainly implicit was hey I'm just the bridge to the next generation of Democrat leaders he effectively told us because he refused to say like hey I'm gonna survey years like all those things he was basically saying hey I'm just here to beat Trump and then move on yet he's now having to run because of the Kamala Harris word salad incompetence that is so aggressive that Democrats can't figure out how to put somebody else in office without being racist in sexist so they're gonna run an 82 year old guy for president which is indefensible on any level but particularly when you consider even for 80 this is a good question buck even for 82 year olds where do you think Joe Biden ranks for 82 year olds not even comparing him to people who are 52 or 42 or 62 I don't even think Joe Biden is that good in terms of his mental faculties for 82 to say nothing of 62 or 40s I mean it's it's kind of like where he was in his Syracuse law school class you know bottom bottom 10 percent I mean we're gonna potentially have a race in 2024 this doesn't get enough discussion where both of the men running for office are older than the average age of death for Americans think about that for a minute if Trump is the nominee he'll be 78 Biden will be 82 both of those men will have exceeded the average age and life expectancy of men in America and this means that both of the possible vice presidential choices are will be significant not just for electoral level never before right I mean usually vice presidents people talk about as someone who might you know help bring some component of support to the ticket or a deliverer estate whatever no the next vice president may have to step in that that's a real thing and I don't know I just I don't know you know they they had a big story buck about how they're trying to redeem Kamala Harris and how everybody is focused now on they got to lift her up because she's become such a big drag to your point buck on the consequential nature of this vice president choice is through the roof even compared to past ones I just I don't know how they can put themselves in a position where they can redeem her because she's just so awful at her job she's an even worse speaker than Joe Biden which is almost impossible to pull off you own a small business of employed five or more people through the covid pandemic you may qualify for decent size tax refund

Sunday hang with clay and buck a new podcast find it on the iHeart app or wherever you get your podcast welcome back in clay Travis bucks extant show so our good friend Keith oberman sorry our good friend Keith oberman who i believe just us a podcast now is that right buck that's his sole employment so far as we know he's not on television right raising many cats i believe raising many cats Keith oberman in his central park apartment um kind of perfect example of what happens if you go too far left wing eventually you just lose your mind and you end up shrieking out on your balcony about how many shots you need to get for covid or else you'll die i guess he made the mistake he hasn't has he come after you in a while buck um not in a little while though i don't i and by the way twitter sometimes hard to follow now so i don't necessarily see crazy Keith oberman dropping into my mentions like i have before so maybe he's still occasionally firing off at me you get a cool nickname because he gave me a cool nickname do you get a nickname or no i don't think i have a nickname i think i'm just basically all that's evil in the world according to uh oberman uh but i guess it came after megan kelly and that was not a really smart decision i don't think megan kelly very smart fearless having a lot of success with uh with her show and we we grabbed this clip because i heard you playing it and i was laughing uh here is megan kelly going after Keith oberman this is what a dead body looks like listen even though he's over with saying similar things comparing tucker to a nazi he also for good measure decided to tweet about me because i said tucker it's going to be better off without fox and said something to the effect of you got fired from fox and mbc what would you know about it so first of all you misstate the circumstances of my departure from mbc sir that's all i'm allowed to say about it and as for fox there were widely reported facts that i was offered a hundred million dollars to stay there but the record's very clear that i left voluntarily because i wanted to raise my family something you don't know anything about because no one would marry you and you have no children you have a cold lonely life in which you become a bitter bitter man something i wouldn't know anything about because my life is joyful and i've managed to raise my own children and someday i hope you have that pleasure but i don't have high hopes it's gonna happen i mean that was a chuk Norris roundhouse kick to the face wow oh my goodness Keith overman is officially dead um and i look i do think buck there's something to be said now that you are a married man i do think there is something to be said for having some form of normal see in your life if you have an abnormal job and i would say that what you and i do for a living is an abnormal job but yesterday for instance i was watching little league baseball and i left little league baseball to go do jesse water show and then i came back downstairs and you know played uh more little league baseball and wiffle ball and everything else i think it's important to have normalcy in your life again if you have an abnormal job and the longer you have an abnormal job it warps you particularly if there isn't normalcy in your life and i think overman is a very strong example of that i would just say also um and i i admit that i come to this with with a degree of bias and i always uh will will put that out in front but i really do believe it so i i say it uh you look at the people on the right who Keith overman was at one point the biggest name at msnbc by far the most famous democrat commentator in the country he is a lunatic my friends and not a very happier nice man obviously and meghan decided that she did not take kindly to him trying to trash her career especially given she's been very very successful so it just it was a bizarre thing for him to do but it shows a nastiness the people on the right who are um you look no one's perfect and we all have our challenges but the people on the right whose names you all know are overwhelmingly um good people that you'd want to hang out with i just i'm sorry it's just true and there are a lot of people on the left who are um so again i'm talking about pundits here in the pundit class and you know whether we're talking cnn msnbc etc uh who are deeply unhappy miserable and nasty people and now it's it's not a perfect system but i think that people people at on the right in media are generally a happier nicer bunch just say it if you get to over 60 years old which i believe overman is and you've never been married and you have no kids i think you really start to spiral out of control if you don't have something really solid in your life right i think nuns probably do pretty well right uh priest hopefully most of them do pretty well because they have that foundation of the church is the central part of their life when the central part of your life is a constantly shifting left wing orthodoxy because buck if keith oberman had been doing esp n 20 years ago and you had asked him hey what do you think about a dude who decides to become a girl winning a women's championship he would have said are you kidding me that's absurd that's ridiculous that will never happen now he will say oh it's very heroic i'm glad that this is happening this is an important moment in women's athletics by the way i spoke to uh riley gains last night go to the clay and buck podcast network about all she's been through and why she's standing for a little bit in sports and uh you know clay lea thomas big big headline the daily mail today coming out firing at people at women for not supporting him enough as a woman racing against actual women in the nc double a so that battle is not over this dude how about the balls on him just don't come right out and call he's gonna get us in trouble again i mean a dude with balls has just said women aren't supporting me enough for being a little boy this is where we are all boy man's got a penis and testicles and he's out here saying hey how come women aren't supporting me enough you're all a bunch of misogynists that's the world we live in how dare you"
