    "text": " Hi, it's Carol Markowitz. I'm so excited to launch my very own podcast. We'll talk to the biggest names and politics, news, entertainment, and get to the truth of the issues that affect your family and have some fun along the way. It's the Carol Markowitz Show, part of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Podcast Network. New episodes drop every Monday and Thursday on the iHeart Radio app, Apple podcasts, or wherever you get your podcasts. Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show Podcast. Thursday edition of the Clay and Buck Show underway right now, everybody. Thanks for rolling in with us. Appreciate you joining me and we've got a lot today. 800-282-82 on those phone lines. If you want to weigh in, a lot of top is going to be covered. Just to give you a sense of it, get a line that's with our guests. We got Senator Ron Johnson on the second hour of the program from the great state of Wisconsin. We talked to him about inflation, the economy, and some of Biden's recent poll numbers are just, wow, in a bad way. Or in a good way, depending on how much you want Biden to lose. Then we've got our friend, Anne Coulter. We're going to talk to you about immigration and also her column this week on the judiciary. And then third hour of the program, our friend, Alex Barranson, who may, at some point, we'll see. Be back on Twitter, possibly, given the realities of our biggest story of the day today, which we're about to dive into. But also, where are we with COVID? Some places bringing back masks, some places and waiting C, 60% increase in some form of BA2 here in New York City. It's, wait a second, are we done or not? Well, they're done at the border because Title 42 is ending, but you're not done on a plane. You got to mask up. What makes no sense? But that's how the libs are. Well, Kline, I want to start today with the news about Elon Musk and Twitter. And I get that about, I don't know, I'd say maybe 5% of our folks listening right now are active Twitter users. And that's not that big. It is enormously important to politics, to media, and to the national conversation as a platform. That's just the reality of it. Donald Trump, I believe, used Twitter more effectively than any politician. Donald Trump used Twitter to do an end run on the mainstream media and actually take the fight to the Democrat aligned corporate media in a way that without that platform would not at the time have been possible. It's one of the reasons they decided to just go for it, kick him off and make it an all out censorship situation where they'll just they shut down ideas. They shut down the hunter Biden laptop. My friends, they may have cost Trump reelection, that one platform by because you say, well, I'm not on Twitter. Yeah, but people catch on on Twitter and then they post more to Facebook and they see this story and they're aware of it. And other people in the media pick up details and stories and threads from Twitter, it grows out from it. It's the public bulletin board. It is the town hall square or the town hall, town square. Same thing. You get what I'm saying. Same idea. I haven't been in a town all in a while. So Clay, there's a lot here, but I just first of all, won't ever understand if nothing else, it's it's just amazing to watch so many people who make a living allegedly in journalism and media and supposedly care about free speech who are in abject meltdown right now, literally shaking because Elon Musk may he's not going to suppress the left. He's never said that. He just says free speech might become into Twitter and the Democrats panic. We all know this. This could be Buck. I woke up this morning. Immediately we're text threading. This could be if Elon Musk were able to buy Twitter. This could be the biggest moment for free speech. And I don't think I'm exaggerating this in most of our lives. In terms of what the impact could be for having someone who was fundamentally committed to the marketplace of ideas that you should be able to have robust, uninhibited debate that Twitter is not going to censor you when you have an opinion that may be outside of the mainstream, that Twitter is not going to block you when you say that there's a difference between men and women and that you can't just choose your gender that we could have inside of Twitter, a real true town square as you put it. And I understand people out there who say, well, just go sign up for GAB or go sign up for truth social or go sign up for for rumble and go sign up for parlor and all these different competing companies. And I give credit to everybody who is trying to compete. But people are not going to in Moss, abandon Twitter and go to a new version of Twitter. It's just not going to happen. Twitter is the place where influence and debate is magnified on an epic scale. Here's my so for those of you out there don't know what's going on. Elon's officially offered $54 and 20 cents a share to buy the company. That news came down about 630 a.m. this morning. And Elon is obviously the richest man in the world right now. But Twitter stock is now down a little bit on the day, which to me I had a lot of conversations with people. Buck they expect for the Twitter board, the people that I talked to to reject this offer from Elon Musk. And then we will get into a real battle. Now maybe Twitter's got some sort of they call it all the time a white knight, somebody who's going to ride in and pay more money than Elon Musk offered get into a bidding war. Somebody else that they like more is offering more substantial dollars. But this is a battle for the ages. I really don't think as an exaggeration to say that. To your point earlier, Buck, I do believe that Twitter and social media as a group turn the outcome of the 2020 election with what they allowed to be shared and what they allowed to be discussed. I think that social media led to the disastrous lockdown universe that has existed for the last two years because they shouted down people like you and me, your kids wearing masks, your kids being out of school, rather than allow real debate to occur. Twitter consistently puts their finger on the scale and weighs it in the way that they decide is appropriate. I think there is panic because of exactly what you laid out going forward that the Democrat left has gotten really used to being able to remember if they just banned people say, well, you're on Twitter, Buck and Claire on Twitter, other. Yeah, but the point is when there's a contentious moment, when there's an election, when it really matters, they throttle you, they suspend you, they shut you down and that shifts the overt in window. That shifts the conversation nationally because of what is allowable online, right? They want people like you and me with substantial followings that tweet, you know, witty, interesting stuff. They want us using their platform, but they want it to be by their rules in ways that's that they do not go after their sacred cows. Now, there's also the issue of if Elon were and by their meeting today at one Eastern time, the board, I would bet money. And I don't think you and I can't bet because we agree on this one. They're absolutely going to reject it. That alone is fascinating because for a company to reject an offer that would make all the shareholders money and would be backed by the literal richest man in the world shows you how important this is to the left. So for all the people listening who don't use Twitter and earn parts of the country, wherever it's like Twitter, who cares? Let me tell you, this is essential to Biden and Kamala and Pelosi and CNN. Although Clay and I maybe will play and I might actually take up a collection today on the street and buy CNN plus for, you know, a couple of hundred bucks maybe. I mean, everyone's saying CNN plus is going to be in the auction block here soon too. Anyway, but the clay that the part of this that I think could be even more interesting, at least to me, is for years, the whole, the whole conversation around social media, you know, you and I started doing this roughly on the same time, let's say 10 plus years ago, right? Being really active on Twitter, Twitter hasn't been around that long, hasn't been a big thing that long. They used to say we don't suppress conservatives. We just have very basic rules and we apply them equally. Then they said, you know, we make mistakes. Sometimes we suppress conservatives, but we don't mean to. It's a free speech platform. And then eventually when Donald Trump came along, it was shut up conservative peasants. We own this by your or build your own Twitter. We're maybe buying it, build your own Twitter, build your own internet. We're kicking parlor off Amazon web services. We're kicking them off the internet, et cetera. Right. If we get access to what I'll call the algo, right? The algorithm, the back end at Twitter, Clay, we would find that they have been shifting the political conversation in favor of Democrats aggressively for the last 10 years. They have been elevating moron blue checks with blue hair, nose rings and too many cats at the expense of people like you and me that actually have something to say. Now, I will say the marketplace speaks eventually, which is the great thing about capitalism. And what I do believe is you're right. Twitter, they did the analysis of who spends the most time on Twitter and who's most prominently featured. And Twitter is 20 points more skewed towards the Democratic party than the United States. So it's like the most left wing Portland Democrat district that you can imagine. And I will say Democrats have become so enamored of Twitter that they think it's the real world that ultimately, I believe that's why their party has gotten destroyed. I think they're leaning into Twitter so aggressively as, oh, this is where the real world is and that dichotomy between what the Twitter real world represents and what the real real world represents is why Joe Biden and the Democrats in general are collapsing. And frankly, why Trump has had so much success. Now, here's the challenge over time, Buck. And this is what I worry about. If Facebook and Twitter and probably TikTok, although I don't know enough about TikTok and Instagram and all of the social media platforms all end up making the exact same decision at the exact same point in time, which is what was so scary to me about Donald Trump getting banned. I mean, they banned him from Pinterest. I don't know if Donald Trump was like trying to sell knitting gear. But I mean, when when when all the women who sit around and sell, you know, like, they're their their latest knit caps are like, there's no way we can have a MAGA cap on Pinterest anymore. Let's ban Donald Trump. It is a collusive, corrosive environment. And what Musk would represent to me is a punch back in the other direction for robust, uninhibited marketplace of ideas. I think if we got access to the Twitter back end via Elon Musk's takeover, which to be clear, they're going to circle the wagon. The left, the Democrat party, this is their digital Waterloo folks. This is they're all in battle because if this happens, not only going forward where there'll be an actual digital marketplace of ideas for politics, culture, everything else, but we'll be able to see how much they've essentially rigged the game in the past, including in kind, what are effectively in kind donations at election time, what are effectively maneuvers behind the scenes at Twitter to elevate or destroy certain politicians and personalities. Obviously, they banned Trump forever. We know they do this. Obviously, they suppressed 100 Biden laptop play. I bet it's been much more than that. And then we have to remember Facebook, Google, they have algorithms too. Does anyone think that if we see what's going on at Twitter, it's not going to be clear it's going on at the other tech giants? I would also point out this. If they turn down what would represent a 20 some odd percent premium for the stock price right now versus what Elon Musk is offering, it's also pretty tangible evidence that Twitter is not being run as a capitalistic venture. That is they are not trying to maximize return for their shareholders. And by the way, I'm one of the shareholders. I've owned Twitter stock for a long time. They're not trying to get as much money in our pocket. They are an ideologically driven center of thought, not a capitalistic driven center of thought. And that's a substantial difference, right? It calls into question even more the marketplace of ideas angle because effectively what they're saying is Twitter is more valuable to the Democrat party to left wing politicians to then then to allow it to be purchased by a free speech. And by the way, I don't even think of even Musk as a conservative buck. I just think of him as a business man who believes that you have to experience all ideas in order to reach the best possible outcome. The position of the right is not well, now let's now let's suppress all the all the that's right. He's in kick. No, I want their idiot ideas. You know, I want you to be able to backhand Keith Oberman Clay. I just don't want you getting shadow band when you when you smoke them online. You know what I mean? I don't want you getting in trouble for it. And that would be the reality we're dealing with here. And I think the fact that Elon is not he's not a dogmatic conservative at all. He's kind of a free thinker. And all he's saying is let's let's actually build a free speech platform. And the left is in Melta. It's so instructive. The left is in meltdown. And get ready for some takes from Washington Post and New York Times writers about billionaires controlling the conversation that without any irony. Yeah. And by the way, the other thing we should mention is just content neutral policies. It's amazing how content neutral policies are that that sort of position, right? That you can't even create just content neutral. We're not saying hey, favor one side or the other. Just treat everybody the same. Come back to this one second play because I just saw this. I don't know if you'd already seen this breaking news from Charles Gasparino over Fox News. Your colleague there. Elon Musk offers to buy the rest of Twitter. A legal source tells Fox Business that the SEC and the DOJ have launched a joint investigation into a myriad of regulatory issues at Tesla. Of this is I mean, I don't even know this. So I said they're going to go with everything they've got folks. They're going to bring up all the artillery they can. They're going to cheat in every way they can. We'll come back into the ways they're going to try this in a second. Look, if you had to choose between two cell phone companies, one that overcharged you for cell phone service and made donations to left wing candidates and causes or another cell phone company that gives you the exact same quality of service, but at half the price and that actually supports your values, which would it be? It's an easy answer, right? It's time to ditch Verizon, AT&T and T mobile. Get your cell phone service from PureTalk. It has the same 5G coverage as one of those big guys, but will save you and your family lots of money. The average family on a plant saves over $800 a year. You can keep your phone number, keep your phone or get huge discounts on the latest iPhones and Android's Clay. What do people get if they get hooked up unlimited talk tech, six gigs of data, just 30 bucks a month. You can also get unlimited data and still save an absolute fortune. Here's how you do it. Grab your phones right now, dial pound 250, say PureTalk and you'll save an additional 50% off your first month. You can be switched over in less than 10 minutes from the same phone, same phone number. Again, grab your phones, dial pound 250, say PureTalk. Hi, it's Carol Markowitz. I'm a columnist at the New York Post and Fox News and author of the best-selling book, Stolen Youth and now host of the brand new Carol Markowitz Show. Yes, I'm taking a new journey and launching a podcast part of the Clay and Buck podcast network. I would like to invite you to join me for the ride. We'll talk to the biggest names in public life and get real answers to the deep questions. I've spent years writing a culture column about the things that really matter and then a book on how to protect your children from the bad forces around them. Now we're bringing that fight along with some fun to this brand new podcast. We'll also feature an advice segment. So send in your questions to Carol Markowitz Show at gmail.com. Join me for the Carol Markowitz Show, new episodes dropping every Monday and Thursday on the iHeart Radio app, Apple podcasts or wherever you get your podcasts. Drama, drama, drama. I'm Clay Travis. He is Buck Sexton. Thanks for hanging out with us here as we roll through the Thursday edition of the program. By the way, we've had an open invite to Elon Musk to come on the show. How many months now do you think it's been out there, Buck? Now, unlike Dr. Fauci, I'm not sure that we've ever even made contact with someone who could talk to Elon Musk. We need to get Ali in to find out if there's been any response to our emails. But we've been trying that offer, I would say, remains if some of you out there listening following along the Twitter battle and you have a contact with the audience, I'm going to say Clay, he can smoke whatever he wants. If he comes to the show, no, we do not judge. He smokes whatever he wants. If he comes on the show, that's fine. If he comes on the show, Buck, I might smoke it with him. So as long as we're in a state where said smoke is legal, by because otherwise I'll probably end up in prison and have the key thrown away. I'll be the first person to be prosecuted aggressively for smoking pot in the history of the Biden administration. By the way, it's funny because the blue checks are up in arms over. Oh, my God. What if this billionaire ends up buying Twitter? What's going to happen? Well, sawed it. One of the top Saudi princes in the last half hour has come out against the Elon Musk bid. You might say, why does that matter? Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal al-Saw, whose name I'm sure I just massacred there is one of Twitter's largest shareholders. So he can vote his shares if Elon Musk offers $54.20 a share, which he has. He can offer that reject that offer. So I don't know what percentage effectively he owns, but a lot of these big hedge funds, these big equity holders, it'll be interesting to see what they do. Because Buck usually, these guys just say, hey, I'm getting a 20% premium on my stock. I'm going to take the 20% premium every time and I'll take that money and roll it into a new stock holding, especially this year where stock markets down 7, 8% if you're a S&P 500 index. Look, if nothing else, even if Elon, if they block this and they are circling wagons and the DOJ has mobilized friends, the Biden regime will fight so dirty over this. Imagine Trump comes back on Twitter and time for the midterms. The libs are going to be drowning in their own tears. But you know, the other part of this, I think is at least we're seeing, at least we're seeing Clay. What a bunch of phoneies they are. What a bunch of frauds when it comes to free speech, the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, you name it, frauds, they're terrified of what we actually have to say in a free and open debate. If you don't have the my pillow gear, you're missing out. It's amazing. You're going to sleep better with those pillows on your bed than you ever have before. That's usually the first one that people go with because you know, it's my pillow, right?

Just go to my pillow dot com, use promo code clay and buck or call 800-792-3269. Welcome back in clay Travis, Buck Sexton show. We wanted to open up phone lines here for you a bit and allow you to ask questions because I think Buck was right. We started off the show. He said maybe 5% of our audience is super active on Twitter or maybe even social media in general, because I think a lot of you rightly do not trust the social media companies to allow you to say what you actually think. But as a result, there may be not comprehension or not understanding about why we believe this is such a significant battle that Elon Musk has now initiated against Twitter. So to open up the phone lines to allow you to ask us questions to react as you see fit 800-282-2882 and buck you and I are in an incredibly fortunate spot. I tell this to people all the time. I think you and I have two of the best jobs in America because in an era when so many people feel like they can't say what they think, you and I get to tell a large audience exactly what we think every day for three hours plus and not have to worry about the consequences of what our opinions are or how people react to them. No one has ever told me in over a decade of doing radio what to say or how to say it's one of the reasons why I love this medium so much. There's a purity to it. And what we see with the social media platforms, of course, is that we're just beginning to understand the full scope of how the system was all rigged and the way that they were gaming it to help the left. And I think part of the success of all those efforts you see in things like the movement right now to shut down anybody who wants to affirm basic biology. I mean, you know, this is a debate we've been our discussion. We've been having a lot here on the show and it's a huge debate nationally. Can a man become a woman? The answer is no. The answer is no. They can say it as much as they want. They can argue with us. The answer is no. But because of the power that the left has in social media, both elevation and suppression, they elevate things they like. They suppress things they don't. You have all these woksters on the left who are going, yes, you can. And the answer is still no. They're still wrong. That has not actually changed. Did you see the story? I think it's out of New Jersey that two women in all women's prisons have gotten pregnant by a trans man. Yeah, they are allowing men who identify as women to be had, which is one of the craziest things out there to be housed in a women's prison. And now multiple women have gotten pregnant by men who identify as women but are still biologically, as you can imagine men. And I got to say, one, it's crazy. Two, if you were otherwise locked up in a male prison and you could be like, Hey, you know what, I identify as a woman and the world is so broken that they would say, okay, we're going to put you in a women's prison. The guys are playing a rigged game, right? Suddenly you're you're you're fission in a stock pond when otherwise you're going to be stuck with a bunch of dudes trying to beat the crap out of you in a male prison. I used to use this slopes are slippery, my friends, anytime someone says, it's a slippery slope fallacy. Slippery slope is not a fallacy. It's a reality. Years ago, I was making the argument on my show Clay about exactly this. I said, just give it time. They're going to have biological males in women's prison. Just give it time. They're going to have biological males in women's sports. And now here we are. And if you say, hold on, it feels like we didn't even have a conversation about this. They they shout you down as a bigot. This is only possible though. The the real wokism is only possible because of their control of social media. That's what I think is important for people to know. And on the if you brought this up on on COVID lockdowns before you would be suppressed for the election issue, people always think of, Oh, what happened 100 Biden laptop and then election fraud allegations after the 2020 election, the initial censorship wave that was out in the open was about COVID. All of a sudden, you were allowed to you it was a violation of terms of service in June and July and August of 2020 to say, Hey, I don't think this mass mandate thing works or Hey, I don't think we should block down certain businesses and keep others open. I mean, the whole notion of essential worker was so arbitrary. You're an essential worker. If you are a podcaster in the state of California, you know, I love what we do to play, right? But I mean, we're not, we're not, you know, putting electric paddles on someone's chest to get their heart beating again. It's crazy what was able to happen. And it was because they shut down some ideas, they elevated others. And this is how you get to this moment of honestly indefensible stupidity from the left. I think that pushes a lot of their panic. They have indefensively stupid positions that they've convinced themselves of clay and they're kind of boxed into a corner now because they've had so much reinforcement on social media without people being able to say, you know, you're a moron, right? Speaking of which, here is Jen Psaki telling everybody that the mask mandate extension we talked about yesterday, it's because of data. Can you help us understand some of the science behind this? Why two weeks? Sure. What difference can be made in such a short amount of time since early April, there's been an increases in the seven day moving average of the cases in the United States. So what they're trying to do is give a little bit more time to assess its potential impact. The rise of the cases have on severe disease, including hospitalizations and deaths and the health care system capacity, and their assessment from a medical standpoint, the data data gathering standpoint is that two weeks would give them some additional time to do that. They just want to yank on America's choke collar a little bit more like we're a canine getting into the petunias. That's really specific. I'm just saying that the petunias blooming yet. I wonder and I don't know if it got asked. How could first of all credit for actually asking that question because there is no good defense. But how could you not ask the question? Explain to me how the CDC can say we're not in a COVID crisis at the border. Therefore, Title 42 doesn't exist anymore, but we are still in a COVID crisis on airplanes. Therefore, you have to wear a mask. Shouldn't you favor citizens over non-citizens in terms of analyzing COVID emergencies? That's a good question, right? That's something that should be asked. I would love to hear the distinction between why the border is wide open now and COVID is not a risk there. But you and I and anybody else out there can't get on an airplane and just fly without wearing a mask. I mean, effectively, Clay, Title 42 is a CDC authority. Now, it's not true to say it's a CDC decision. If the executive branch, if the White House put down a directive saying we're ending it, it's ended, right? The CDC is not an independent of the executive branch entity. That's not how it works. That said though, the FAA is extending because of CDC guidance, a mask mandate on planes because they say it's too scary. It's so how can you have one and not the other? It's either safe or we're not safe. It's either not a problem or it is a problem, but they want to have it both ways as they always do, which is why they want to control social media. And by the way, that's why I'm not saying that I think the border should be wide open. Just the dichotomy there between saying it's safe at the southern border. It's not safe for you to be on airplanes. Meanwhile, we know based on people who are pretty well plugged in, every major airline CEO has requested that the mask band they be taken away. We got a caller yesterday airplane pilots have sued flight attendants have sued huge numbers of people out there who make their living on airplanes or managing airplane companies are all saying, this is nonsensical. There's no basis to support it any longer. It is actually, I would argue, it is a safety risk for people to be forced masked on planes because we all know why there's been a huge increase in violent incidents on planes. It's because of the dumbass mask policies, which make everyone agitated. And you know, unless you're an anxious weirdo, again, just get a COVID still, even though planes actually a safe place to be. It's because of people getting agitated. The whole air, the whole airport experience, you got to wear a mask in the airport. Yes, security, the whole thing, you feel like, you know, cattle being hurt it into a pen the whole time. And you have to wear a mask for note for no damn good reason. That's why people flip out and there have been punches thrown and issues. It is a safety risk to force people to mask on planes. That's what the data supports. The data supports that the data also supports that there are overwhelming amount of delays, which are also increasing the overall stress level and anger. And I do think there's just a dull, remember, I ghostbusters to buck when the pink ooze is underneath the city and everybody's just angry because when you came in contact, you remember that? You ever ghostbusters, I got a we got we got a pink ooze issue, I think in the entire country where people are just angry over things that make no sense that are being foisted. Well, well, the pink ooze is flowing right now on Twitter because we should be angry. I just saw this again. Hat tip, Charles Gasperino over at Fox News. Twitter is in the red as traders believe Elon Musk's regulatory woes, which were just reported before, will give Twitter the board the room to reject his takeover bid. Think about how the system, the apparatus works friends. Elon is going to buy it the libs, the left, the Democrats are in a panic. So the Biden DOJ launches a federal investigation of Elon's other company to give the Twitter board an excuse to turn down what's an obviously smart bid for them to take. I they play so dirty. They're appalling. And by the way, that same party is in power. And they know that Twitter will therefore help them to remain in power using the rigged social media algorithms that overwhelmingly favor the Democrat party. It's a dirty regain. It's why Elon needs to win this battle, but it's going to be an ugly one. In the meantime, for most of us, the single largest purchase we ever makes a home makes sense. Right mortgage broker to work with is key as crucial. And for me, that's been American financing. Look, they will hook you up right now with the best possible rate you can find. Now, you may be thinking, well, aren't mortgage rates starting to rise? Yes, they are. But you can still walk in and historically low rate plus, and this is significant, you may well have a ton of equity in your home right now. You ever go on Zillow, look at the value of your home, your condo, wherever you're living right now? Most of the country, those values have been going up quite a bit. Maybe you can take advantage of that incredible line of home equity you have and lock in a move that can make your family's financial situation infinitely better. You could pay off the credit card debt. You could skip a couple of mortgage payments as a part of a refi. You can get hooked up right now with an incredible offer. Call American financing. 800-777-8109. Again, let me remind you, buying a home, refinancing a home, adjusting your rates based on home equity. This is the biggest decision from a financial perspective most of you will ever make in your life. How much time do you spend deciding where to buy gas? How much time do you spend deciding which products to buy in the grocery store to help maximize your money in a time of high inflation? A lot, probably. So why wouldn't you give just 10 minutes to American financing and call them today? 800-777-8109, americanfinancing.net, and MLS182334, NMLSK, consumer access.org. I'd like to invite you to join me for the ride. We'll talk to the biggest names in public life and get real answers to the deep questions. I've spent years writing a culture column about the things that really matter and then a book on how to protect your children from the bad forces around them. Now we're bringing that fight along with some fun to this brand new podcast. We'll also feature an advice segment. So send in your questions to carolmarkowitshow at gmail.com. Join me for the Carol Markowitz Show, new episodes dropping every Monday and Thursday on the iHeart Radio app, Apple Podcasts, or wherever you get your podcasts. Play Travis Bach Sexton Show as we roll through the program. Bach, I think we take a couple of calls. We opened up the phone line, said does anybody have any questions out there? What do you think? Who should we take first? Arnold in Florida. What do you got for us Arnold? Guys, I know I'm first up and I hate to suck the air out of everybody's balloon, but you know, the question's got to be asked, why is twitter relevant? And twitter is only relevant because every mainstream media, you know, puts tweets out there adding on to them. If Elon Musk buys it, they'll run away from it like it's got to go. I disagree. Yeah, I just I appreciate it on all that. I don't I don't see any of what Donald Trump was probably the single most influential Twitter user for four years. And look, I think it's overrated how easy it is to build a new twitter. In other words, the amount of time that you spend to have the following that you do, whether you're an individual or a media company to go somewhere else new, the investment of time and energy is unlikely to be replicated elsewhere. So I don't buy into the idea that CNN, for instance, is just going to say, well, we're done with Twitter forever. And we're not going to share our content and that CNN's providers or MSNBC's or whoever it is that they're going to bail. The impact of Twitter is too substantial. It's it's still for them. Remember, no one no one suggests. And by the way, I don't even want an orders clay. We're not saying the left should be kicked off Twitter. No, no, we just want we just want it to be a level playing field for for ideas and for speech. That's all. So the left will exist in that world. They just will have a much harder time getting away with stuff, pushing their agenda without pushback. So they're not gonna gonna abandon the field just because Elon, I mean, I mean, I appreciate our calling on it. I don't see I don't see that at all. And if anything, we've there have been a lot of people on the right who have actually used Twitter very effectively. What we saw was people on the right, whether it was Barranon or Trump or, you know, there are a number of folks who battle on B. I think my Babylon B, our buddy Pete Haggsath, who's going to be coming on the show soon from Fox, I think Twitter because they were using Twitter so well. Right. So let's yeah. Well, and look, all we're asking for is content neutral. This is big. Like we're we're not saying, Hey, we want things to be rigged in our favor. I'm just saying I want the policies to be applied evenly, no matter how you might feel politically, I want the same standard for speech. I should be able to argue against Dr. Fauci's idea that that COVID spread from an animal to a human. And I should be able to say, well, this data reflects that maybe it came from a lab instead. That was not allowed forever. I should be able to share, by the way, Hunter Biden stories from the New York. Oh, we're going to get into that one in a few minutes favor being locked should be should be one of the biggest stories in the country, but the Libs are not interested in at all, of course. But just before we go to a couple more calls, Clay, I despise Fauci. I think he's a horrible person that's basically like ruined millions of lives and stolen years from people absolutely despise what that man has done to this country and to the world. Just a reminder, while Shanghai's in lockdowns where you can't even leave your apartment or they'll actually lock you in a cell and they're stealing people's pets and bludging them to death in bags and it's horrible. It's going on over there. Fauci early on was a big China lockdown proponent. China has a number of problems, two of which are that their complete lockdown, which was their approach, a strictest lockdown that you'd never be able to implement in the United States. Although that prevents the spread of infection and remember early on, they were saying, and I think accurately that they were doing better than almost anybody else. But yeah, no, they weren't. Clay. This is the problem with this is no, that's not better than anybody else. There's nothing good about any of it. And he just said, you know, you could never do it here. Would Fauci want to do it here? I think if he could have gotten away with it, he would have noticed that, yeah, we got to do the China lockdown in America. Oh, I don't think there's any doubt that he watches all the drones and all the people on their balconies unable to go anywhere and thinks, my God, it's beautiful. It's glorious. The sound of all these people who are locked up. Again, understanding that there's a multivariable analysis in every situation in life. And when you make one choice, you impact other choices, we had a childlike analysis of how to respond to COVID. And I think a big reason why tying it all in was Twitter, will in Montana. We got about a minute. Will, what's up? Big Sky did us from you out here. Just a quick comment about the whole social media. I'm an airline pilot, and I'd not only have to worry about the government sitting there and hating what it is when I post truth online. I also have to worry about what my boss is going to because I work in one of the craziest, wokest industries out there. And if I publish something that doesn't fit with their little cultural paradigm or doesn't go into their diversity, equity and inclusion policy, they could fire me and I could never work another day in my life because of an opinion I have outside of work. Gotta fight for the First Amendment friends in all contexts and all kinds of ways. Will, keep the skies safe my friend. Thanks so much. Clay, there's this little hunter Biden thing about maybe covering his family's expenses in the New York Post. You know, Joe Biden, his family, their expenses. I think we should talk about it. Let's do it. Hi, it's Carol Markowitz. I'm so excited to launch my very own podcast. We'll talk to the biggest names and politics, news, entertainment and get to the truth of the issues that affect your family and have some fun along the way. It's the Carol Markowitz Show, part of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Podcast Network. New episodes drop every Monday and Thursday on the iHeartRadio app, Apple Podcasts or wherever you get your podcasts."
