Go to human events calm slash poso sign up today It's called the post so daily brief read what I read for show prep you will not regret it human events calm Pozo totally free the post so daily brief Ladies and gentlemen welcome aboard today's edition of human events daily powered by turning point USA Today is April 28th 2023 and no Domini today's sub story the Fed chair Jerome Powell has been tricked into revealing an Elite call that a recession is Likely and sorry behind it is amazing next new study shows that 88% of boys outgrow Gender dysphoria by age 20 and finally the left is melting down over new data showing that nine out of ten people arrested By Texas DPS in Austin or either black or Hispanic we're gonna break it all down all this and we're head to human events daily But we would tell you that our session is almost as likely as as as very slow growth So that's that's a fact and I think that is partly because of Us having raised rates quite a bit, but this is what it takes to get inflation down we to get inflation Off of the high we've had inflation at its highest level in 40 years To get inflation to come down what we need is a period of slower growth so that the economy can cool off So the labor market can cool off So that wages can cool off and so that that's how inflation comes down That's the only way we know to bring inflation down and it can be painful But there is we don't know of any painful wet pain less way For inflation to come down that every session is on the way. He knows it's on the way In fact when you listen to him, it almost sounds like like a planned Recession like a scheduled recession. Oh the recession is you know further on the corner. It's come. It's gonna be fine You guys are gonna be great. Don't worry about it. We'll be fine. He knows he'll be fine What about the rest of us? What about the people who have to live in this country? What about the people who have to live in this economy have to work who have to have savings? Who live in hand to mouth paycheck to paycheck? What about people who have mortgages? What about people who are in debt? Who tapped out all their credit cards over the past couple of years because of the economic turn down? What do you say to them? Well, you turn around and you say oh, we're gonna set another hundred billion to Ukraine fire up the money printer because here's what's going on So in this call that's Jerome Powell and he's talking to a couple of Russian Praying phone call guys and he's tricked them or they've tricked him into believing that it's presence a linsky He's talking to at one point. He actually starts praising the Russian central government for being so resilient to the international sanctions Well, here's the thing Powell and this is what kills me They know this they know everything at the top go look at Jake Sullivan's recent talk with Brookings It's so obvious The elites know that they screwed the pooch on this economy They know they're going all the way back to the building of the system of globalism back in the 1990s When they brought NAFTA in when they brought globalism in when they started outsourcing everything to China remember that story Remember that word that we were told that phrase that we were told about how oh, we're all gonna get better Everything's gonna be fine, but then President Obama and other people were coming out and saying you know those jobs aren't coming back There's a lot of truth to that because under this type this type of administration under this type of administration You're not gonna get those jobs back because all they're gonna do is continue spending overseas Then they're gonna continue pressing the money printer They're gonna continue printing and printing and printing until this country is completely in debt up to its ears And they're not actually going to use any of the economic leverage that the United States has as one of the biggest and most expensive markets in the entire country one of those lucrative markets in the entire world Every country on the planet should be charged to do business for the privilege of doing business in the United States You want to sell something here Apple and it's made over in China from Foxconn Well, guess what you're gonna pay the paper if you want to sell something Sony if you want to sell something for any of these countries any of them you have to pay a price for the privilege of operating in the United States and for the privilege of Selling something to the American people you can say oh no, oh no The retarians are gonna go mad about this. They're saying why how could you how could you do that? That's a tax that's where against those things those are evil those are to what the United States of America was built on tariffs It's an external tax not an internal tax. They're gonna be taxes. Okay, grow up You need to grow up and be an adult you're never gonna get rid of all taxes in the United States of America So the question is are we setting up our tax system in such a way that we are helping? foreigners at the behest or I should say at the detriment of actual Americans because guess what that's exactly how our tax code currently is Sullivan knows this Powell knows this and Powell also knows that what he's doing is ratcheting up The prices because that's already happening through inflation through the money printing So what's he doing? He's ratcheting up the rates because he can't turn off the money printer He doesn't have the authority to do that Now you can talk about that. Oh you want there's been lots of debates is this And I've said the before I don't necessarily think that the world economic forum is like picking him up on the phone and saying This is cloud swab. You must print more money Yes, the money will is not come in my coffee the printer is unplug The other vink no That's not how it works not like some cartoony jeans bond thing what it is though is these are the policies of the world economic forum the same policies that are out there and These people actually believe it and that's something where You know what was funny is that In all the Tucker Carlson stuff that was out there in that great video He did he mentioned something about these people don't believe the things that they say maybe in terms of wokeism To an extent, but I think that there is a great majority Of the elite who really do believe they are saving the world and only they can save the world through their intellectual finish Unfortunately for us folks they are true believers the true believers are in power and they're running us all off the economic cliff You got to go buy some coops. I know what else to say Look are you tired of progressive corporations and exhausted trying to keep up with all the virtue signaling when you're trying to buy products Progressive corporate America continues to push messaging that further alienates Conservative Americans all while eroding the future of the American dream It's prominent all over the country companies like Starbucks strong arming their customers to support abortion Financial services like PayPal canceling customers for their political views makeup companies Mike Maybelline Making a mockery of women by supporting transgender models and beer companies like Bud Light forcing gender radiology on you Thankfully, we don't have to fund these companies any longer with our hard-earned dollars with public Square.

I Came out to my parents when I was 12 going on 13 and their reaction was To take me to a therapist because they didn't know how to handle this They didn't know anything about this and they thought that it would be best to get a professional involved but What ended up happening was thought my Delusion of actually being the opposite sex was affirmed. I was treated as if I were a boy they they only referred to me by My by my preferred name and by my preferred pronouns and they didn't go by anything else they never even went into The underlying Issues that I had and what they knew of they didn't address It was just treated as a completely standalone issue from my gender dysphoria and They told my parents later that And in an appointment they had I don't think I was there for this actually so I couldn't really refute anything That was that was said and I didn't I didn't know What they were what they were telling my parents at the time, but they told my parents that If I wasn't allowed to transition then it was very likely that I would kill myself So that was Chloe Cole from our Whirlwind I would say human events Sunday special with both her and Ollie London about D transitioning and in that special we talked about how this is massive business for big pharma The earlier they can get you hooked on gender hormones that earlier they can get you starting the surgeries starting these transitions The longer they have to get money off of you They're looking at this like a market as as Alex Stein Has said in the past drag queen story hour is a marketing strategy so the question then for us becomes How true is this? Is this actually something that they use that you know, that's that's that's some true statement That oh, they're gonna stay this way and it's gonna help them. They're gonna feel better Well, here's an issue and in a new study out from frontiers in childhood The boys were assessed at a mean of seven point four years Mean year was 1989 follow-up mean age of 20 years. Okay. I mean you're of 28 2002 in childhood 63% of the boys met this gender dyph dysmorphia dysphoria disorder but of the participants 12% were classified as per sisters When they went from seven years old to 20 years old and of the remaining 87.8 percent 88 percent Were classified as desisters. What does that mean? This goes through bifilic Andrew phillic Classified over 33% were classified as gyna phillic which means you're actually obsessed with Looking as a female having a sexual fetish at a sense and The real story for us is that This was something that as children as young as seven mean of seven. They thought they were into they thought was important to them By age 20 they had grown out of it Now this also came up recently because Elon Musk was getting into our group one of these left wing guys on Twitter who was saying oh Oh, you know, this this isn't happening. It's not true. They're talking about the question of suicide and This is the same thing. They said the Chloe Cole's parents because I asked her I said how could your parents go along with this and I'm thinking about my own kids thinking what you know My kid came to me and said oh daddy. I want to do this. It's like you kidding me not even chance But in Chloe Cole's case they went to her parents and said she will more than likely commit suicide If you do not do this well Elon Musk put out a statement and put out this link to a study when he was getting into this online debate with some of these left wingers and Pointing out that there is a high rate of suicide with people who transition so the liberal responds and says oh Wait, but actually see you're wrong because the group that you studied already had a two-thirds more More likely to commit suicide in the general population and then Elon responded Okay But the study found that it was still the same rate of suicide after the transition So you understand that the study that the little guy posted actually debunked Exactly what he was trying to state has showed that there was no difference whatsoever in those rates this transition all of it The surgery the hormones the procedures it did nothing to stop the rate of suicide in the people because they have a mental Disc order. That's how it should be treated good Folks as the parallel economy continues to grow we've seen tons of conservative coffee companies come and go I'd held off until I found one that I really liked and that's what I'm happy to tell you about blackout coffee It's not enough to simply taste great You want to be proud to support the company knowing they align with your conservative values And that's what I'm telling you to give them a try and I'm telling you guys I think it Tonya Tae has been drinking my blackout coffee because I went to go and pour myself a cup the other day I couldn't find the bag said where was it? Oh got moved What did it get moved by the little gremlins or the borrowers coming out of our cabinets and moving it around or was it you? Let's see because we don't keep it where the kids can get it. Uh-uh Could you imagine my toddlers on blackout coffee please? Crazy not far as it is. That's why I'm proud to personally recommend blackout coffee This is a coffee company that is a hundred percent committed to conservative values I believe it when I'm chasing after those guys I need my energy from sourcing the beans to the roasting process Customer support and shipping they've got incredible work ethic and absolutely no compromise on taste or quality go to blackout coffee Dot com slash posto and use promo code posto on 20% off your first order stop giving your money to vote Companies that don't care about you stay true to our values It's Travis County attorney Delia Garza says the recent DPS partnership with APD is Putting community trust at risk calling new data quote extremely concerning This comes after DPS records show troopers are pulling over more people of color since the agency started helping Austin police with patrols County Attorney Garza's office says it gathered data and it shows at 65% of the people DPS arrested for misdemeanors or Latino and 23% were black Census data shows 48% of minorities make up Austin's population the increased DPS patrols began on March 30th As a response to staffing challenges faced by APD County Attorney Garza sent KX and a statement saying in part quote We all agree that we need to prioritize violent crime and true threats to public safety And I'm hopeful the city and DPS can find a way to accomplish this without disproportionately impacting communities of color. Oh Here we go again. Here we go again. Just proportionate impact disproportionate impact So I'm gonna do two things really quick first thing I'm gonna do is debunk those numbers because that's propaganda You're being pushed right now These are not all the arrests that are taking place in Austin right now. These are the DPS arrests DPS is working with the APD But the DPS is coming in and I'm just gonna say it They're arresting the people that the APD just won't arrest. Why is that? Well, I guess you'd have to go and talk to the Austin City Council the fact the same Type of council that you find in pretty much every large blue city because they don't like to conduct the policing Operations that need to be done in larger cities and particularly They don't want to go after this this is the George Ferguson effect that we're seeing right here because the policing these areas and To an extent I understand because nobody wants to become the next Eric Chauvin and so you you lay off You deep police you say I'm not gonna go arrest those guys What happens if something goes wrong and I get put behind bars for doing something that my city trained me to do using a tactic That my city trained me to to do and was authorized by the city at the time the mayor's not gonna have my back They're gonna go after me the the police team means gonna go after me it They did stand by Chauvin at least in terms of paying for his his legal services, but They know they're done for if they get into a chauvin situation. So the city police are de-policing and Then the state police are coming in to arrest the people that aren't being arrested by the APD So you know I'm saying so the numbers you're looking at are not the total numbers They're a portion. They're a sliver of the numbers. Okay. That's number one number two. I got a respond to that guy going when he was when he was reading the The the stats right there reading the story he was saying was it 63% I think what did he say 63 65 whatever was They're Latino they're Latino or Latino so Orca to say carza Really so you're speaking English if you're speaking English Then you use the English pronunciation. This is a very simple concept to understand Okay, I speak Mandarin Chinese, but you know what when I'm speaking English I say Shanghai and Beijing and Hong Kong I don't use the Chinese names. You know why because I'm speaking English to people in America I can do it too. I can say Beijing. I can say Shanghai. I can say Shanghai I can do all of that stuff, but I'm not going to you know why because I'm not a pretentious fruit And that is exactly what you sound like right now like you're oh music me I'm going to go and use the the local pronunciation of this Particular word here. It's it's like when Obama used to say um Pakistan Pakistan You remember that he would say Pakistan you wouldn't say Pakistan of gunistan Like like what are you doing man? You're you're an American. Why are you changing your voice? Which is a code switching? Why are you changing your voice for just one word? Don't do it. It drives me nuts. I have an absolute pet peeve about it You sound stupid.

You're just going in vatas low t guys who who their wives have boyfriends and Pretty much as anyone who drinks soy talks like this if you notice something Forecourish woman katulji gabbard does not use up talk. She uses very downward inflection at the end of her sentences. That is how People know that when they listen to her they are getting declarative statements.

So when we look at this we have to understand This type of hit piece that's being done right now On the texas dps is exactly what's going to happen in every time a red state comes into a blue city and tries to clean it up They're going to call you racist. They're going to smear you. They're going to attack you now Notice what's what's missing from all of all of his uh, you know He's going to take the time to go and talk about the lactino community But he's not going to say anything about the Fentanyl use that has skyrocketed in that community and in the african-american community because oh look Looky what we have here from the travis county medical examiners report There has been a massive increase in fentanyl related deaths in 2022 This is the same report that just came out yesterday and let's see let let's see what it says Oh look at this The fentanyl related overdoses increased by 460 for african-american and black people and 247 for hispanics So it turns out that in in the city of austin right that's where travis county is There is a massive hyper Hyper crisis going on right now a hyper crisis of fentanyl deaths That the texas dps is trying to deal with by locking up the fentanyl dealers by locking up the people who are involved with this You know why?
