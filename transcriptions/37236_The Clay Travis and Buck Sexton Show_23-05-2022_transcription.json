Now, Buck, you have done real time with Bill Maher before. You've been on his HBO show. Yes, sir. And I saw, I couldn't believe this, Bill Maher has never won. I don't believe in Emmy for real time with Bill Maher, which is crazy when you consider how many people fall over themselves to reward John Oliver, which is just a written show that he reads off a teleprompter every week. But Bill Maher has been increasingly red-pilled. Just looking at the facts, looking at the evidence, we've been talking about this on a variety of subjects. On some subjects. Yes. He has not read, like, he is never going to come over to our side period, but on some issues, because he's a civil libertarian. He has old school. When I say old school, I don't mean classical liberal as in John Stuart Mill on Liberty liberalism, which, by the way, well worth the read, if any of you haven't ever gotten around to it, you know, 17th century, they knew some things. But he's a 1980s, 1990s style liberal, where you still believed in free speech, even when it was offensive. That's where this comes from. So Bill Maher decided to address this transgender related issue that has become a real fighting point for Democrats. And tying in with this, this was a big flashpoint in the comedy universe because of Dave Chappelle. And what he said on his Netflix special, and by the way, Buck, did you see the guy who attacked him on the stage, said the reason why he attacked Dave Chappelle was because he was triggered by the jokes that Dave Chappelle had made. And by the way, what did they do to that clown who decided to attack Dave Chappelle on the stage in L.A. with a weapon, mind you, they didn't even charge him with a felony buck. He got charged with a misdemeanor because it's almost impossible to get charged with a felony in many Democrat cities right now. So here is what Bill Maher had to say. We've got a couple of different clips from the show. Let's play cut for first. Bill Maher on the recent trend of people identifying as LGBTQ. And finally, the neural of something about the human race is changing at a previously unprecedented rate. We have to at least discuss it. Broken down over time, the LGBT population of America seems to be roughly doubling every generation. According to a recent Gallup poll, less than 1% of Americans, born before 1946, that's Joe Biden's generation, identify that way. 2.6% of boomers do, 4.2% of Gen X, 10.5% of millennials, and 20.8% of Gen Z. Which means if we follow this trajectory, we will all be gay in 2015. Look, he's using facts and figures here to make an argument that when you start to take in the full scope of it, it's pretty jaw-dropping. It's pretty stunning that you now have 20% of Gen Z identifying as LGBTQI8+. And I mean this, by the way, I don't even mean this as a, I'm not trying to be controversial. At some point, an acronym is just too long. I just, I'm just, I come from a CIA background. I used to be able to have whole conversations with people where instead of nouns, it was just all acronyms, and then you even sort of replace some of the verbs with acronyms. So I come from an acronym culture, and LGBTQIA+, is too long. So we have to come up with a different term just for the, just for ease of use, okay? It's not even a political statement. And then put that aside. Clay, for 20% of Gen Z to be identifying this way, and you look at the numbers, and you look at what Bill says about how this is not happening in equal measure all over the country. You get to a point where you either recognize that Santa Monica and Brooklyn and Northwest D.C. And wherever the fancy liberals live in Chicago, I don't really know. I didn't study it enough. But either they're producing through indoctrination more transgender youth, or there's something else going on. Here's Bill Maher talking to that point actually. Dr. Erica Anderson is a prominent 71-year-old clinical psychologist who is herself transgender, and who now says, I think it's gone too far. The LA Times summarizes, she's come to believe that some children identifying as trans are falling under the influence of their peers and social media. If you attend a small dinner party of typically very liberal, upper-income Angelenos, it is not uncommon to hear parents who each have a trans kid having a conversation with them. Having a conversation about that. What are the odds of that happening in Youngstown, Ohio? If this spike in trans children is all natural, why is it regional? Either Ohio is shaming them or California is creating them. There's a couple of things he touched on there. One is just the statistics. It doesn't add up, right? Numerically, people understand, hold on, there's something going on here that's not just all of a sudden, because on the trans issue in particular, that's where really young kids all of a sudden are becoming trans. And there was that study that Brown University published and then retracted on rapid onset gender dysphoria, which was essentially social contagion among highly impressionable children for this, for transgenderism to become very clustered. So when you have one five year old, this says, I'm trans, all of a sudden it's a thousand percent more likely you're going to have three other kids in the same class who are going to be, you know, who are going to decide that they're trans. They're attacking Bill Maher for this play, by the way, glad, which is a very powerful activist organization. Tweeted, this is not the first time Bill Maher has spouted inaccurate anti-trans rhetoric. But this time he's targeting youth, pundits who fear monger about trans youth and surgeries need to learn the facts. It's not a trend. It's not a phase. Youth are not rushed into medical transition. I think glad is wrong on all counts there at the end. Yeah, I do. And this is me taking, I was talking about this exact issue with a lot of parents. We had a graduation party, as many of you out there are doing so many different kids graduating. And by the way, now there's like graduations I got a graduation to go to tonight for my fifth grader. I mean, are there fifth graders that aren't graduating, by the way, like is it at some point there kindergarten graduations? Like it's impossible for you not to graduate from fifth grade to sixth grade, right? It would actually be a crime. But anyway, I'm going to one of those. So this graduation season, everybody's graduating at all ages. I got an eighth grade graduation. So we're having a big discussion about this. And I think these are the kinds of discussions that lots of parents are having out there. And this is one where I think Bill Maher is right in a big way. And as a part of his discussion, Buck, he said, Hey, when I was eight, I wanted to be a pirate. And if someone had let me poke my eye out so I could wear an eye patch and saw off my leg so I could have a peg leg, that would have been absolutely ridiculous. Now it's humorous to think about, but every parent out there has kids who want to dress up and pretend that they are something other than what they are. This is a natural point of childhood. My kids dressed up like jetties. They dressed up like pirates, even outside of Halloween, right? And if you allow an eight or nine or 10 or 11 or 12 year old kid to make all of the choices in their life, Buck, they often make bad choices. That's why we have something called a parent. The idea that we are allowing people under the age of 18 to make lifelong life changing decisions about what gender they are is to me, madness and child abuse. And it is a discussion we must have because if you want to get pumped full of hormones when you're 19, that should be your right. But the idea that we're allowing anybody to do it pre-majority is insane. It's really happening. And this is where the fight, this is where the fight starts to become so intensely political right now is that this is adults who are imposing their ideological and political fashions in a sense on children, deciding, oh, you have a, you're six years old, you think you may be a girl. There are now, there are now laws in different states where you can't even try to convince that child. I don't actually think that that's true. You always have to affirm the conveyor belt toward affirmation of the beliefs of a sexual, let's understand to your point, Clay, you're a parent, you got three kids, right? We tell kids they're wrong about stuff all the time. We tell parents it is right. We steer kids away from this all the time. And for, you know, for people want to say, oh, but it's all about, you know, self actualization. And there is a real medical phenomenon called body integrity identity disorder. Now you may not have heard of this. This is a real thing. You can find it on official, you know, psychiatric, psychiatric literature. It's also called apoteminophilia. And it's when someone is absolutely convinced they would be happier and better off if you amputate a half of your life. You amputate a healthy limb, remove my leg and my life will be better. Now, psychiatry obviously treats this as we are not removing your leg. You should not do that. Your life will not be better. But you start to wonder how different is it for a 12 year old to believe? You know, I really need to have my organs removed. My, my, you know, gender organs, sex organs removed to try to become something I can never actually become. Despite what they say men cannot get pregnant, men cannot get periods, et cetera. How different is it from body integrity identity disorder, really? Because there wasn't, it wasn't long ago that it was body dysmorphia, right? Or I'm sorry, gender dysphoria, pardon me, gender dysphoria, body dysmorphia, as anorexia, gender dysphoria, which was something that you treated from a psychiatric perspective as no, no, you aren't actually a different gender. And over a long period of time, if somebody was an adult and they said, okay, well, then you, then you have a different process. But in children, it was no, no, we're not going to do this right now. The left has changed this clay. They, they now the White House itself is saying it is standard of care to affirm the gender transition decision of prepubescent, prepubescent kids, even little kids, six year old, seven year olds. And this is why there's so, there's, look, the American people just flatly aren't with the activist community on this. They're just not. And this is why the Democrat party is scrambling. Well, and look, this is also take it outside of transgender related issues. We don't let kids sign contracts that bind them until they become 18 years old. We don't let kids be able to serve in the military until they're 18 years old. You can't get a beer until you're 21. And a lot of places want to allow you to get a rental car until you're 25. And yet we are telling young kids, you can decide to cut your genitals off when you are below the age of consent in your state. I mean, this is a clay about why we make those choices about mental health because we know your brain's not fully developed until you become an adult. You also will see. I mean, for a lot of you who aren't spending your time involved in the discussions online about this and the tweets back and forth, there are smarmy blue checks who are either some of them are self described, doctors or medical personnel of some kind, others work in the media who say, Oh, it's giving giving puberty blockers is no big deal. It's reversible. No, I'm sorry. It's a very big deal. And the notion of it being reversible as if NBD. Let's just try this out and see how this goes. The literature, the long term studies for what happens to a 12 year old that you give this stuff to in 20 years does not exist. And what we do know of it from particularly the chief of gender transition surgery at Johns Hopkins University Medical Center for decades is that long term life outcomes are not good. Long term mental health outcomes are not good. And you have a White House that is saying this is standard of care and you have an activist community. And like I said, a lot of my friends who are gay really resent the being gay means you have to stand up for trends indoctrination of five year olds in school. No, it doesn't. They've come to me. I mean, I've interviewed. I've talked to them on air. I've talked to them a person. They're like, that's not this. This has nothing to do with that. So there's there's a lot here and Bill Maher. Look, he's he's poking the the dragon on the left here. He's actually he's taken a risk because they come after people for this stuff. But you speak out on this one. They want to ruin your life. Look, friends, millions of Americans contend with chronic pain every day. Their entire aisles in the drugstore dedicated to solving this problem. And there's so many doctors visits people go on year in and year out, right? But still the pain persists. There's no automatic solution. But we do see a brand that's providing a real solution to many members of this audience. It's called relief factor created by doctors and perfected with over 15 years of scientific research. Relief factor was made for these circumstances with four key ingredients. Relief factor is a 100% drug free product that addresses joint pain, inflammation around the knees, hips, back, neck, shoulders. Relief factor can help with all of that. Hundreds of thousands of people have ordered relief factor and nearly 70% of them go on to order more. If you're currently in pain and have a seven and 10 chance to eliminate it, those are really good odds, right? Like Mark in Texas who shared his story with us. Many Americans consider all their options before trying relief factor. Mark had been hearing about relief factor on the radio for months after an especially painful day dealing with his right shoulder. He said, look, I'm going to try the quick start program from relief factor within two weeks, three times a day. The pain and tenderness in both of Mark's shoulders noticeably decreased. Join the more than half a million people order the three week quick start for only 1995. Go to relieffactor.com or call 800 for relief.

We've got the title 42 situation still playing out. Judge has prevented the Democrats from doing what they want to do. Believe it or not, which is to get rid of title 42 and then deal with the huge surge. But first, I mean, Clay, I, I do not, I make it a point to not care about celebrity culture. You know, I don't, I don't pay attention to this stuff as much as I can possibly be avoided. This Amber Heard Johnny Depp trial is taken up a lot of the oxygen in the news cycle. Still, how is this possible? Way more people, according to data care about the Johnny Depp Amber Heard trial than anything about abortion. Then anything about Ukraine, I mean, you cannot escape how incredibly overwhelming this has become to such an extent that I talked to our out kit crew. And I was like, man, we've kind of blown this. We should be covering this trial more significantly. I think Johnny Depp's on the stand right now. It continues to roll and it could represent from a larger perspective. Maybe the end of me too, because it seems like nobody suddenly believes Amber Heard at all.

What's not changing is Joe Biden has virtually nothing to run on after 18 months in office and maybe he's going to get some help by what happens with the Supreme Court as it pertains to their abortion decision whenever that might come down. But David Axelrod, who was instrumental in Barack Obama being elected president and serving for eight years. So he certainly knows Joe Biden well acknowledged on CNN that there's not a lot that Biden can do with that midterm freight train looming as we move closer and closer to November 8th. Listen to this. The question is what can leadership do? I mean, there are limited levers to pull here relative to some of the things that are troubling people obviously on the baby formula issue. He's exercise the defense production act. And there are things that you can do at the margins, but in many ways, he's at the mercy of larger forces here. Inflation is hard to reverse. The fan has the major cudgel here, but that involves raising interest rates, which has its own problems. There are other things you could do like relative to tariffs or student loans that would be unpopular. I mean, there really aren't a lot of tools here for him. And that's what makes this so uncomfortable. Can we just say, I mean, this is David Axelrod, who he's smart. I mean, not particularly ethical or anything, but he's a smart guy for what that's worth. Basically telling Democrats, I got nothing. He's like, look, there's really not anything between now, realistically, between now and election day, where there's a real game changing opportunity for the Democrats, given what the polls are showing, what the economy is doing. They simply don't have, I mean, think of it this way, if they could convince people right now that the country is doing well, we could get invaded by China. The government could get overthrown. And they would still be telling us, right? At some level, it just turns into absurdity. There's no, there's no connection to reality if they can actually get away with saying things are going well right now. So I think that what you're going to see from Democrats is an effort to hyper localize as much as they possibly can, right? Every congressional seat, every Senate seat is about that district, that state, that one candidate, and a lot of separating the Democrat candidates out there, especially in any competitive state, right? And what they're going to do for seats in New York and California is obviously just Democrats are going to win the places they always win. But for any place where there's a there's some, there's a competitive seat up, they're going to be saying, Oh, I'm not, I'm not here doing Joe Biden's bidding. And that, I think the media is also realized clay that Jan six is just not going to do it. People just feel like it's actually gone from this isn't a, it's an unfair narrative. It's not, you know, it doesn't represent the entire Republican Party, et cetera. But even more than that, it's not politically potent because people see and unrunning that stuff. They're like, I don't have baby formula right now. Yeah, you want to, you want to lecture me on January six and the threat to our democracy. You know, you, the, or the dirty trickster in chief Hillary Clinton going to go out there and the Democrats are going to make a big stink about how the threat to our democracy. No, the threat to people right now is they can't pay their bills because the idiots in charge seem to think that they can spend whatever money they want. There's no consequences. Turns out they're wrong. And a lot of people are going to dial out, as you well know, we've got Memorial Day weekend coming up and people start going on vacation. They do what I do, which is spend a ton of time at Little League Parks. If you've got kids, your kids are going to be out. You've got to keep them busy Wednesday. My kids get out of school for the summer. I'm going to go pick them up and then start being responsible to try to keep them busy, right? And that will go all the way up to many people for Labor Day. And you know what's going to be the constantly resonant tone here? How angry everybody is every time they fill up their gas tank. That is a tried and true test every single day of what is the president and his political party meaning for you. And you put that, that, that hose in. And it's over a hundred dollars for you to fill up your car, your SUV, your truck, whatever it is, the highest it's ever been. Every single time that happens, Buck. It's another point off. It feels like for Joe Biden's approval. And I would just also note as they're going to be trying to come up with different narratives and storylines about this. If the Democrats, I think people, this is in some ways, what's really, I think, pushing a lot of the momentum. It's not just that things are bad. It's that if the Democrat party had its way, if it weren't for Joe Manchin, Christian cinema, and then all of the Republicans saying, stop being crazy lives. Don't do this. If they actually got, if Build Back Better had passed, if Democrats had enough votes for cap and trade for the Green New Deal for all their different environmentalist fantasies, lunacies. The price of gas would be much higher. Inflation would be much higher. Not only are things going poorly, the only reason they aren't going worse in every respect that matters across countries, the border, the economy, you name it, is that there has been some pushback on the Democrat ideas that would have actually made everything would have added to the current woes that we see. And I think people are realizing that. And that's, that's particularly terrifying. Well, and that's what I think is a really great sales pitch for Republicans. Look, we have all the failures of the Biden administration, but really at this point, what you're hoping to do is run out the clock. Just keep Joe Biden from being able to do anything worse during the rest of his term in office. So they're going to go off all the congressional House of Representatives members and all of the senators who were up for reelection. They're going to leave DC in the summer. And then the hope is that they don't try to do something with a lame duck Congress to pass through legislation. And then you don't really allow anything in 23 and 24 to happen. And then we go into a new presidential election. Now, who's even going to be running for the Democrats and what that's going to look like on their side? And then what's going to happen? I saw a straw poll come out Buck from Wisconsin looking at 2024 contenders and Trump came in second to Ron DeSantis. Now, that's a little bit of an outlier poll. Obviously, there's lots of people out there that are very excited about Donald Trump running again in 2024. But there are also other Republicans that are angling to say, Hey, I'm not going to sit this one out and just let Trump be the default nominee. Now, is that going to be a minority opinion? Maybe, but I've said for a while, I think DeSantis is going to run. We know guys like Chris Christie and Mike Pence and and and and people of that ilk are going to toss their hat into the ring. So both political parties are going to have real big decisions to make basically the morning after we wake up on November 9th and see what the actual income, the actual outcome is as it pertains to the midterms. You know, there's that that wisdom, so to speak, or the conventional wisdom for presidents that everything you're going to get done. You have to get done essentially in the first six months because then it turns into political battles. What's funny except for the Biden administration, they basically didn't get anything done. And if they had, then they would have been completely up a creek without a battle. That's the reality of this administration. I really don't know, Buck, what's going to happen because I don't think they're going to be able to pass anything in 2023 and 24. And there's a lot of you out there saying how will you because if they do pass anything, it just means more governmental spending, which puts more inflationary pressure out there on the economy at large. So the best thing that could happen is nothing, which is just a testament to how bad the Biden administration has been that that is where we are hoping now that the politicians basically can't do anything. And people forget that in the early days of the Republic, DC was a malarial swamp. There was yellow fever and typhus. And yeah, in the summer times, you and I've been there in the summer. And it is. It's not a malarial swamp, but it is very swampy in so many respects. They'd go home for months at a time. They'd go, they'd be out of there. And they, you know what? The country didn't melt down. We actually don't need these people constantly doing things, usually telling us what to do and taking our money. That's what they really excel at. Yeah. And that's a bad feeling for a lot of people out there. Hopefully they're not going to be able to get that tax increase through, which they've been trying to ram through since Joe Biden got inaugurated.

And you know Clay this weekend, I was taking it easy this weekend because as everybody could hear, I was struggling last week. It took you a while to get over that. Yeah, I was sick for almost 10 days. I mean it was rough. But this weekend I was doing that. You know, I'm reading a phenomenal book. I will say I just bought a book that you recommended on the lowest in Clark Expedent. Just arrived today. I don't take courage. Undaunted courage is an incredible. I'm going to give my review because we're going to start going back and you know, I'm going to give you some records. You give me Rex. I'm going to read on dog courage. That's next on my list. I'm reading Keegan's World War One History of the First World War, which I've been meaning to read for a long time. Absolutely phenomenal. Like it even a little more than the Guns of August by Barbara Tuckman at this point, which is one of the classics that everybody reads about World War One. Very, very good for what it is. But I think Keegan's scope is a little bit better, a little bit, a little bit more my style. But I also found a new show. Have you ever seen? So I got to ask because you're going to probably make fun of me. You sci-fi, are you in or out on sci-fi as a thing? Like I can't get carried to watch any sci-fi. See, we've got some rules. I'm not anti sci-fi at all. But like we love Star Wars, for instance, in the house. Is that sci-fi? I almost feel like that's epic. Like it's almost more than sci-fi stars. So what would you say? Like I'm not huge on Star Trek, you know, like for instance, that's definitely sci-fi. Yeah. I mean, Star Wars is sci-fi, but to me that sort of occupies almost. It's like you don't have to be into Dungeons and Dragons and fantasy genre, like Lord of the Rings, for example, right? Because it's such a big, you know, trilogy epic. I found Game of Thrones that wouldn't really probably count, although it's fantasy. You know, I try to get my dad to watch it. Who's like, oh, like there's like a dragon. What is this? Like, yeah. With the CGI dragon thing, he's like, I can't get him to get past that. You know, there's not, he's not into CGI dragons. But I found a show that I'm sure a lot of the audience, and I started to binge watch it because I was just trying to drink tea and get my voice back. The Expanse? You were watching? I've never heard of it. Very solid, very good show. I'm accused of often saying how much different shows stink, which is not fair, but people say this about me. The Expanse, I will say, is very good. And Carrie and I are now deep into season three of Yellowstone. So I did follow up with that, Rick. It does really catch on for me. You didn't like the first couple of episodes, right? Like you just did kind of bass. Like a cowboys? What am I, you know, really like, you know, cowboy, get into a car. What are you doing? But no, no, it actually makes more sense. On the Lewis and Clark front, my argument, I'm going to keep beating this drum until eventually somebody makes it. If somebody would turn the Steven Ambrose, undaunted courage story of Lewis and Clark, obviously there's tons of different Lewis and Clark stories that have been done. But his particular book was the sort of originating source material for a show. I'm giving, if there's anybody in Hollywood who listens, any streaming companies who aren't super woke executives who are listening right now, it would be the number one show in America. Because if you look at the power and popularity of Yellowstone, the 1893 or whatever the heck the other show is that was done there, there's a huge, I believe, and what's going to happen this weekend with the top gun, a maverick coming out. There's a huge desperate demand for America is awesome content. I think that's totally correct. I think that's totally correct. America is awesome. People are tired of America. Like the left wing, America sucks. Screw the USA angles. American history is awful. The Lewis and Clark expedition as a show long form, multi-season streaming stories, first of all, incredible. These guys were traveling for years through virgin territory that had never been seen by any American before. It would be incredible. Ripping into it. I will say that one of the upsides of I've, I mean, I'm canceling, I canceled Disney Plus. I'm going to cancel Hulu. I'm on the, I'm on the precipice of canceling Netflix too, honestly. You know, you know what kept me going with it was the Formula One show, which I like so much. There's usually like, how are you going to watch shows if you cancel everybody? Amazon Prime. I like Amazon. That's what, now I know Amazon is woke too. Look, I'm not perfect, right? I mean, I've got my, I've got my, uh, my pressure points on me. Um, but I, I think, uh, because of the Netflix wokeness, I've really made more of an effort. You know, I didn't have a TV in my 30s for five years and I read stacks and stacks and stacks of books. You know, I was like that, that, that guy. And then I finally, I'm starting to see why you're still single. Wow. Wow. T first of all, have a girlfriend second of all, the range is hot, Mr. Klyan. I understand right now. I don't have a TV guy and I'm not married guy. They overlap a little bit. I will say, okay, so it's funny you're calling me on it because you know, I got a TV because at one point, my sister, my little sister was brilliant. She's very like very straightforward, like just called like this. She's like, yeah, Bucko, you need to get a TV because like, otherwise you might get a little weird. It's got to be that there is fair. That would be for me now with sports. I mean, like the idea of not having a television, like I would just, I, I, it makes me feel physically ill to think that I couldn't be able to watch any sporting event that I want to. But, but this is like, this is an unknown buck, buck detail. Five years without a TV. That is a long time without a TV. But, but I've, I've been ripping through the stack because I'm not really binge watching. I watch a little of the expansion, not really binge watching shows in the Garden of Beasts, Eric Larson, just that one. Amazing. Unbreakable about San, San Perini, the, the track star gets captured. Yeah. So amazing. So amazing. So I'm, we got to do, we got to do like on clay and buck.com or something. We got to start putting like clay clay top 10 or, you know, favorite stack and we'll put a stack because yeah, I like that idea. And we just need to have one place where we can put our rec because I'm going to read, you better by the way your Yellowstone was a good rec. So I got to be credit. But this book you just told me, Undaunted Courage. I'm going to rip through that one, buddy. Like probably by the end of Memorial, they'll be done. You're going to love it. And one of the great things about it is you're going to think, my God, what a was I am, not just you, but everybody in America who reads what these guys went through were all a bunch of softies. They didn't have Uber Eats. Clay Travis and Buck Sexton on the front lines of truth. And I'm going to have a look at the next book. I'm going to have a look at the next book. I'm going to have a look at the next book. I'm going to have a look at the next book. I'm going to have a look at the next book. I'm going to have a look at the next book. I'm going to have a look at the next book. I'm going to have a look at the next book. I'm going to have a look at the next book. I'm going to have a look at the next book. to the freedom of retirement. But who wants to wait till then to kick back and chill out?
