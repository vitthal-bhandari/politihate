    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucksxton show podcast Thursday edition of the clay and buck show underway right now Everybody thanks for rolling in with us appreciate you joining Man, we've got a lot today 800-282-82 on those phone lines you want to weigh in a lot of top is gonna be covered Just to give you a sense of it get a line is for their guess We got senator Ron Johnson on the second hour of the program from the great state of Wisconsin but talked him about inflation the economy and some of Biden's recent poll numbers are just Wow in a bad way or in a good way depending on how much you want Biden to lose Then we've got our friend Ann Coulter We're gonna talk to about immigration and also her column this week on the judiciary And then third hour of the program our friend Alex Barran sin who may at some point we'll see be back on Twitter Possibly given the realities of our biggest story of the day today, which we're about to dive into But also where are we with COVID some places bringing back masks some places and waiting C 60% increase in Some form of BA to here in New York City. It's wait wait a second Are we done or not well? They're done at the border because title 42 is ending but you're not done on a plane You got a mask up what? Makes no sense, but that's how the libs are Well, we're going I want to start today with the the news about Elon Musk and Twitter and I get that about I don't know I'd say maybe 5% of our folks listening right now are active Twitter users. It's not that big It is enormously important to politics to media and to the national conversation as a platform That's just the reality of it Donald Trump. I believe use Twitter more effectively than any politician Donald Trump used Twitter to do an end run on the mainstream media and actually take the fight to The Democrat aligned corporate media in a way that without that platform would not at the time have been possible It's one of the reasons they decided to just go for it kick him off and make it an all-out censorship Situation where they'll just they shut down ideas. They shut down the hunter Biden laptop my friends. They may have cost Trump re-election that one platform by because you say well I'm not on Twitter Yeah, but people catch on on Twitter and then they post more to Facebook and they see this story and they're aware of it And other people in the media pick up details and stories and threads from Twitter. It grows out from it It's the public bulletin board. It is the town hall square or the town hall town square same thing You get what I'm saying same idea. I haven't been in a town hall in a while So clay there's a lot here, but I just first of all won't ever understand if nothing else It's it's just amazing to watch so many people who make a living Allegedly in journalism and media and supposedly care about free speech who are in abject Meltdown right now literally shaking because Elon Musk may he's not gonna suppress the left He's never said that he just says free speech might become into Twitter and the Democrats panic We all know this this could be buck. I woke up this morning Immediately we're text-threading This could be if Elon Musk were able to buy Twitter This could be the biggest moment for free speech and I don't think I'm exaggerating this in most of our lives in terms of What the impact could be for having someone who was? Fundamentally committed to the marketplace of ideas that you should be able to have robust Uninhibited debate that Twitter is not going to censor you when you have an opinion that maybe outside of the mainstream that Twitter is not going to block you when you say that there's a difference between men and women and And that you can't just choose your gender that we could have inside of Twitter a real true Town Square as you put it and I understand people out there who say well just go sign up for gab or go sign up for truth Social or go sign up for For rumble and go sign up for For parlor and all these different Competing Companies and I give credit to everybody who is trying to compete but people are not going to in Moss Abandon Twitter and go to a new version of Twitter It's just not going to happen Twitter is the place where influence And and debate is magnified on an epic scale. Here's my so for those of you out there don't know what's going on Elon's officially offered fifty four dollars and twenty cents a share to buy the company that news came down about six thirty a.m. this morning and Elon is obviously the richest man in the world right now, but Twitter stock is now down a little bit on the day, which to me I had a lot of conversations with people buck They expect for the Twitter board the people that I talked to to reject this offer from Elon Musk And then we will get into a real battle now Maybe Twitter's got some sort of they call it all the time a white knight somebody who's gonna ride in and pay more money Then Elon Musk offered get into a bidding war somebody else that they like more is offering more substantial But this is a battle for the ages I really don't think is an exaggeration to say that to your point earlier buck I do believe that Twitter and social media as a group turned the outcome of the 2020 election with what they allowed to be shared And what they allowed to be discussed. I think that social media led to the disastrous lockdown Universe that has existed for the last two years because they shouted down people like you and me your kids wearing mass Your kids being out of school rather than allow real debate to occur Twitter consistently puts their finger on the scale and weighs it in the way that they decide is appropriate I think there is panic because of exactly what you laid out going forward that the Democrat left has gotten really used to Being able to remember if they just banned people say well you're on Twitter buck and Claire on Twitter other Yeah But the point is when there's a contentious moment when there's an election when it really matters They throttle you they suspend you they shut you down and that shifts the overton window that shifts the conversation Nationally because of what is allowable online right they want people like you and me with substantial followings that tweet You know witty interesting stuff they want is using their platform But they want it to be by their rules in ways that's That they do not go after their sacred cows Now there's also the issue of if Elon were and by their meeting today at one Eastern time the board I would bet money and I don't think you and I can't bet because we agree on this one They're absolutely going to reject it that alone is fascinating because for a company to reject an offer that would make all the shareholders money and Would be backed by the literal richest man in the world Shows you how important this is to the left So for all the people listening who don't use Twitter and earn parts of the country wherever it's like Twitter who cares? Let me tell you this is essential to Biden and Kamala and Pelosi and CNN Although clay and I maybe will play and I might actually take up a collection today on the street and buy CNN plus for you know A couple hundred bucks maybe I mean everyone say CNN plus is gonna be in the auction block here soon, too anyway But the clay that the part of this that I think could be even more interesting at least to me is For years the whole the whole conversation around social media You know you and I started doing this roughly in the same time Let's say 10 plus years ago right being really active on Twitter Twitter hasn't been around that long hasn't been a big thing that long They used to say we don't suppress conservatives We just have very basic rules and we apply them equally then they said you know we make mistakes sometimes we suppress Conservatives, but we don't mean to it's a free speech platform and then eventually when Donald Trump came along it was Shut up conservative peasants. We own this buyer or build your own Twitter We're maybe buying it build your own Twitter build your own internet We're kicking parlor off Amazon web services. We're kicking them off the internet, etc, right? If we get access to what I'll call the algo right the algorithm the back end at Twitter clay We would find that they have been shifting the political conversation in favor of Democrats Aggressively for the last 10 years they have been elevating more on blue checks with blue hair nose rings and too many cats At the expense of people like you and me that actually have something to say now I will say the marketplace speaks eventually, which is the great thing about capitalism and What I do believe is you're right Twitter they did the analysis of who spends the most time on Twitter and who's most prominently featured and Twitter is 20 points more skewed towards the Democratic Party than the United States so it's like the most left-wing Portland Democrat district that you can imagine and I will say Democrats have become so enamored of Twitter that they think it's the real world that ultimately I believe that's why their party has gotten destroyed. I think they're leaning into Twitter So aggressively as oh, this is where the real world is and that dichotomy between What the Twitter real world represents and what the real real world represents is why Joe Biden and the Democrats in general are collapsing And frankly why Trump has had so much success now. Here's the challenge over time buck and this is what I worry about if Facebook and Twitter and probably TikTok although I don't know enough about TikTok and Instagram and all of the social media platforms all end up making the exact same decision at the exact same point in time Which is what was so scary to me about Donald Trump getting banned. I mean they banned him from Pinterest I don't I don't know if Donald Trump was like trying to sell knitting gear But I mean when when when when all the women who sit around and sell you know like they're there their latest knit caps are like There's no way we can have a MAGA cap on Pinterest anymore. Let's ban Donald Trump It is a collusive Corrosive environment and what Musk would represent to me is a punch back in the other direction For robust un-inhibited marketplace of ideas I think if we got access to the Twitter back end via Elon Musk's takeover, which yeah be clear They're gonna circle the wagon the left the Democrat party. This is their digital waterloo folks This is they're all in battle because if this happens not only going forward where there'll be an actual digital marketplace of ideas for politics Culture everything else But we'll be able to see how much they've essentially rigged the game in the past including In kind what are effectively in kind donations at election time What are effectively maneuvers behind the scenes at Twitter to elevate or destroy certain politicians and personalities? Obviously they banned Trump forever. We know they do this obviously this oppressed a hundred Biden laptop clay I bet it's been much more than that and then we have to remember Facebook Google they have algorithms too. Does anyone think that if we see what's going on at Twitter It's not gonna be clear. It's going on at the other tech giants I would also point out this if they turn down what would represent a 20 some odd percent premium For the stock price right now versus what Elon Musk is offering It's also pretty tangible evidence that Twitter is not being run as a Capitalistic venture that is they are not trying to maximize return for their shareholders and by the way I'm one of the shareholders. I've owned Twitter stock for a long time They're not trying to get as much money in our pocket. They are an ideologically driven Center of thought Not a capitalistic driven center of thought and that's a substantial difference right it calls into question even more the marketplace I've had ideas angle because effectively what they're saying is Twitter is more valuable to the Democrat Party to left wing Politicians to then then to allow it to be purchased by a free speech and by the way I don't even think of even Musk as a conservative buck I just think of him as a businessman who believes that you have to experience all ideas in order to reach the best possible outcome The position of the right is not well now. Let's now. Let's suppress all the all the less reason kick No, I want their idiot ideas You know I want you to be able to backhand Keith Oberman clay I just don't want you getting shadow-bend when you when you smoke them online You know what I mean? I don't want you getting in trouble for it and and that would be the reality we're dealing with here And and I think the fact that Elon is not he's not a dogmatic conservative at all He's kind of a free thinker and all he's saying is let's actually build a free speech platform and the left is in Melta It's so instructive the left is in meltdown and get ready for some takes from Washington Post and New York Times writers about billionaires I've already seen that without any irony. Yeah, and by the way, the other thing we should mention is just content neutral policies It's amazing how content neutral policies are That that sort of position right that you can't even create just content neutral We're not saying hey favor one side or the other just treat everybody to say come back to this one second play because I just saw this I don't know if you'd already seen this breaking news from Charles Gasperino over Fox News your colleague there Elon Musk offers to buy the rest of Twitter a legal source tells Fox Business that the SEC and the DOJ Have launched a joint investigation into a myriad of Regulatory issues at Tesla of this is it's I mean, I don't even know this so I said they're gonna go with everything They've got folks. They're gonna bring up through all the artillery they can they're gonna cheat in every way They can we'll come back into the ways. They're gonna try this in a second Look if you had to choose between two cell phone companies one that overcharge you for cell phone service and made donations to left Wing candidates and causes or another cell phone company that gives you the exact same quality of service But at half the price and that actually supports your values, which would it be it's an easy answer, right?

He is bucks Sexton thanks for hanging out with us here as we roll through the Thursday edition of the program by the way we've had an open invite to Elon much to come on the show how many months now do you think it's been out there buck now unlike Dr. Fauci I'm not sure that we've ever even made contact with someone who could talk to Elon Musk We need to get Ali and to find out if there's been any response to our emails But we've been trying that offer I would say remains if some of you out there listening Following along the Twitter battle and you have a contact with the On he can smoke whatever he wants if he comes to the show. Yeah, we do not judge He smokes whatever he wants if he comes on the show. That's fine if he comes on the show buck. I might smoke it with him So as long as we're in a state where said smoke is legal By because otherwise I'll probably end up in prison and have the key thrown away I'll be the first person to be prosecuted aggressively for smoking pot in the history of the Biden administration by the way It's funny because the you know the blue checks are up in arms over. Oh my god What if this billionaire ends up buying Twitter? What's gonna happen? Well saw it one of the top Saudi princes in the last half hour has come out against Elon Musk bid you might say why does that matter? Saudi Prince alwalee Ben Talal al-Sawd whose name? I'm sure I just massacred there is one of Twitter's largest shareholders So he can vote his shares if Elon Musk offers $54.20 a share which he has he can offer that Reject that offer so I don't know what percentage effectively he owns but a lot of these big These big hedge funds these big equity holders It'll be interesting to see what they do because buck usually these guys just say hey I'm getting a 20 percent premium on my stock I'm gonna take the 20 percent premium every time and I'll take that money and roll it into a new stock holding Especially this year where stock markets down seven eight percent if you're a S&P 500 index watch look If nothing else even if Elon if they block this and they are circling wagons and the DOJ has Mobilized friends the Biden regime will fight so dirty over this imagine Trump comes back on Twitter and time for the midterms The libs are gonna be drowning in their own tears But you know the other part of this I think is at least we're seeing at least we're seeing clay What a bunch of phonies they are what a bunch of frauds when it comes to free speech the New York Times the Washington Post CNN you name it frauds They're terrified of what we actually have to say in a free and open debate If you don't have the my pillow gear you're missing out It's amazing. You're gonna sleep better with those pillows on your bed than you ever have before That's usually the first one that people go with because you know, it's my pillow, right? But for me, I'm gonna tell you something my all-time favorite product I've got the mattress toppers the slippers the towel sets the roads the geezer dreams sheets Sheets are so important It's gonna get in hot in a lot of places across the country right now you want sheets that are soft and Breatheable, but also durable so when you wash them. They're not gonna get torn up. They're not gonna change the consistency that you're feeling against your skin You want the geezer dream sheets now lowest price ever coming in as low as $39.99 when you use promo code clay and buck Go to my pillow calm click on radio list or specials and use promo code clay and buck for 60% off the geezer dream sheets Just go to my pillow calm use promo code clay and bucker call 800-792-3269 Welcome back in clay Travis Buck Sexton show We wanted to open up phone lines here for you a bit and allow you to ask questions because I think buck was right We started off the show He said maybe 5% of our audience is super active on Twitter or maybe even social media in general Because I think a lot of you rightly do not trust the social media companies to allow you to say what you actually think but as a result there may be not comprehension or not understanding about why we believe this is such a Significant battle that Elon Musk has now initiated against Twitter So to open up the phone lines to allow you to ask us questions to react as you see fit 800-282-2882-800-282-2882 and buck you and I are in an incredibly fortunate spot I tell this to people all the time. I think you and I have two of the best jobs in America Because in an era when so many people feel like they can't say what they think You and I get to tell a large audience Exactly what we think every day for three hours plus and not have to worry about the consequences of what our opinions are Or how people react to them. No one has ever told me and over a decade of doing radio What to say or how to say it's one of the reasons why I love this medium so much There's a purity to it and what we see with the social media platforms Of course is that we're just we're just beginning to understand the full scope of how the system was all rigged and Yes The way that that they were gaming it to to help the left and and I think part of the success of all those efforts you see in things like the movement right now to shut down anybody who wants to affirm basic biology I mean, you know the this is a debate. We've been our discussion. We've been having a lot here on the show and it's a huge debate nationally You know can a man become a woman the answer is no the answer is no They can say it as much as they want they can argue with us They go the answer is no But because of the power that the left has in social media both elevation and suppression the elevate things They like they suppress things. They don't You have all these wokesters on the left who are going yes, you can and and the answer is still no They're still wrong that has not actually changed Did you see the story? I think it's out of New Jersey that two women in all women's prisons have gotten pregnant by a trans man Yeah, they are allowing men who identify as women to be had which is one of the craziest things out there to be housed in a women's prison And now multiple women have gotten pregnant by men who identify as women But are still biologically as you can imagine men and I got to say one It's crazy to if you were otherwise locked up in a male prison and you could be like hey You know what I identify as a woman and the world is so broken that they would say okay We're gonna put you in a women's prison The guys are playing a rigged game right suddenly you're you're you're fishing in a stock pond when otherwise You're gonna be stuck with a bunch of dudes trying to beat the crap out of you in a male prison. I used to use this Slopes are slippery my friends anytime someone says it's a slippery slope fallacy slippery slope is not a fallacy It's a reality years ago. I was making the argument on my show clay about exactly this I said just give it time they're gonna have Biological males in women's prison just give it time. They're gonna have biological males in in women's sports And and now here we are and if you say hold on it feels like we didn't even have a conversation about this They they shout you down as a bigot. This is only possible though The the real woke is them is only possible because of their control of social media That's what I think is important people to know and on the if you brought this up on on COVID lockdowns Before you would be suppressed for the election issue people always think of oh what happened 100 Biden laptop and then election fraud Allegations after the 2020 election the initial Sensorship wave that was out in the open was about COVID all of a sudden you know, you it was a violation of terms of service in June and July and August of 2020 to say hey, I don't think this mass mandate thing works or hey I don't think we should Lock down certain businesses and keep others open. I mean the whole notion of essential worker was so arbitrary You're an essential worker if you were a podcaster in the state of California You know, I love what we do to play right? But I mean we're not we're not you know putting electric paddles on someone's chest to get their heart beating again It's crazy what was able to happen and it was because they shut down some ideas They elevated others and this is how you get to this moment of Honestly indefensible stupidity from the left. I think that pushes a lot of their panic They have Indefensively stupid positions that they've convinced themselves of clay and they're kind of boxed into a corner now Because they've had so much reinforcement on social media without people being able to say you know, you're a moron, right? Speaking of which here is Jen Psaki Telling everybody that the mask mandate extension we talked about yesterday clay. It's because of data. Oh You help us understand some of the science behind why two weeks sure what difference can be made in such a short amount of time since early April increases in the seven-day moving average of the cases in the United States So what they're trying to do is give a little bit more time to assess its potential impact the rise of the cases have on severe disease Including hospitalizations and deaths and the health care system Capacity and their assessment from a medical standpoint the data data gathering standpoint is that two weeks would give them some additional time to do that They just want to yank on America's choke collar a little bit more like we're a canine getting into the petunias That's a really specific I'm just saying the petunias blooming yet. I um, I Wonder and I don't know if it got asked how could first of all credit for actually asking that question because there is no good defense But how could you not ask the question? Explain to me how the CDC can say we're not in a covid crisis at the border Therefore title 42 doesn't exist anymore, but we are still in a covid crisis on airplanes. Therefore you have to wear a mask Shouldn't you favor citizens over non-citizens in terms of analyzing covid emergencies? That's a good question, right? That's something that should be asked I would love to hear the distinction Between why the border is wide open now and covid's not a risk there But you and I and anybody else out there can't get on an airplane and just fly Without wearing a mask and effectively clay title 42 is a CDC Authority now, it's not true to say it's a CDC decision if the executive branch if the White House put down a directive saying we're ending it It's ended right there the CDC is not an independent of the executive branch entity. That's not how it works That said though the FAA is Extending because of CDC guidance a mask mandate on planes because they say it's too scary Yes, so how can you have one and not the other it's what we're either safe or we're not safe It's either not a problem or it is a problem But they want to have it both ways as they always do which is why they want to control social media and by the way That's why I'm not saying that I think the border should be wide open just the dichotomy there between saying it's safe at the southern border It's not safe for you to be on airplanes Meanwhile, we know based on people who are pretty well plugged in every major airline CEO Has requested that the mask band they be taken away We had a caller yesterday airplane pilots have sued flight attendants have sued Huge numbers of people out there who make their living on airplanes or managing airplane companies are all saying this is nonsensical There's no basis to support it any longer it is actually I would argue it is a safety risk for people to be forced Masked on planes because we all know why there's been a huge increase in violent incidents on planes It's because of the dumbass mask policies Which make everyone agitated and you know unless you're an anxious weirdo Even though planes actually a safe place to be it's because of people getting agitated It's a whole airline the whole airport experience. You gotta wear a mask in the airport Yes, the security the whole thing you feel like you know cattle being hurt it into a pen the whole time And you have to wear a mask for note for no damn good reason That's why people flip out and there have been punches thrown and issues It is a safety risk to force people to mask on planes. That's what the data supports the data supports that the data also supports that There are overwhelming amount of delays which are also increasing the overall stress level and anger And I do think there's just a dull remember Ghostbusters to buck when the pink ooze is underneath the city and everybody's just angry because when you came in contact Remember that you ever got your Ghostbusters. I know we got we got we got a pink ooze issue I think in the entire country where people are just angry over Things that make no sense that are being foisted well well the pink ooze is flowing right now on Twitter because we should be angry. I just saw this again hat tip Charles gas burino over at Fox News Twitter is in the red as traders believe Elon Musk's Regulatory woes which were just reported before We'll give Twitter the board the room to reject his takeover bid Think about how the system the apparatus works friends Elon is going to buy it the libs the left the Democrats are in a panic. So the Biden DOJ launches a federal investigation of other company to give the Twitter board an excuse to turn down what's an Obviously smart bid for them to take I they play so dirty. They're appalling and By the way that same party is in power and they know that Twitter will therefore help them to remain in power Using the rigged social media algorithms that overwhelmingly favor the Democrat Party It's a dirty rig game. It's why Elon needs to win this battle, but it's going to be an ugly one In the meantime for most of us the single largest purchase we ever makes a home makes sense Right mortgage broker to work with his key is crucial and for me that's been American financing look They will hook you up right now with the best possible rate you can find now You may be thinking well aren't mortgage rates starting to rise.

What do you think who should we take first? Arnold in Florida. What do you got for us Arnold? Guys I know I'm first up and I hate to suck the air out of everybody's balloon But you know the question's got to be asked why is Twitter relevant and Twitter is only relevant because every mainstream media We you know put tweets out there add nauseam if Elon Musk buys it they'll run away from it like it's got I disagree Yeah, I just I appreciate it on all that. I don't I don't see any what Donald Trump was probably the single most influential Twitter user for four years and Look I think it's overrated how easy it is to build a new Twitter In other words the amount of time that you spend to have the following that you do whether you're an individual or a media Company to go somewhere else new the investment of time and energy Is unlikely to be replicated elsewhere? So I don't buy into the idea that CNN for instance is just gonna say well We're done with Twitter forever and we're not gonna share our content and that CNN's providers or MSNBC's or whoever it is That they're going to bail the impact of Twitter is too substantial It's it's still for them remember no one no one suggests and by the way, I don't even want an orders clay We're not saying the left should be kicked off Twitter No, no, we just want we just want it to be a level playing field for for ideas and for speech That's all so the left will exist in that world. They just will have a much harder time Getting away with stuff pushing their agenda without pushback So they're not gonna go they're not gonna abandon the field just because Elon I mean, I mean I appreciate our calling and I don't see I don't see that at all And if anything we've seen there have been a lot of people on the right who have actually used Twitter very effectively What we saw was people on the right whether it was Barran sin or Trump or you know There are a number of folks who battle on be I think my Babylon be our buddy Pete Haggseth is gonna be coming on the show soon from Fox I think I'm Twitter because they were using Twitter so well, right? Yeah, that's yeah Well, and look all we're asking for is content neutral. This is big like we're we're not saying hey We want things to be rigged in our favor I'm just saying I want the policies to be applied evenly No matter how you might feel politically. I want the same standard for speech I should be able to argue against dr. Fauci's idea that That covid spread from an animal to a human and I should be able to say well This data reflects that maybe it came from a lab instead that was not allowed forever I should be able to share by the way Hunter Biden stories from the New York Oh, we're gonna get into that one in a few minutes favor being locked should be should be one of the biggest stories in the country But the Libs are not interested in at all of course, but just before we get to a couple more calls clay I Despise Fauci. I think he's a horrible person. That's basically like ruined Millions of lives and stolen years from people it Absolutely despise what that man has done to this country into the world Just a reminder while Shanghai's in lockdowns where you can't even leave your apartment or they'll actually lock you in a cell And they're stealing people's pets and bludging them to death and bags and it's horrible. It's going on over there Fauci early on was a big China lockdown proponent China has a number of problems two of which are that they're complete Lockdown which was their approach a strictest lockdown that you'd never be able to implement in the United States Although that prevents the spread of infection and remember early on They were saying and I think accurately that they were doing better than almost anybody else, but like yeah, no they weren't like This is the problem with this is no that's not better than anybody else. There's nothing good about any of it And he just said, you know, you could never do it here Would Fauci want to do it here? I think if he could have gotten away with it, he would have said yeah We got to do the China lockdown in America. Oh, I don't think there's any doubt that he watches all the drones and all the people And their balconies unable to go anywhere and thinks my god. It's beautiful. It's glorious the sound of all these people who are locked up Again Understanding that there's a multi variable analysis in every situation in life and when you make one choice you impact other choices We had a child like analysis of how to respond to COVID and I think a big reason why tying it all in was Twitter Will in Montana we got about a minute will what's up? Big guy did I was from you out here just a quick comment about the whole Social media I'm an airline pilot and I'd not only have to worry about the government sitting there and hating what it is When I post truth online I also have to worry about what my boss is going to because I work in one of the craziest Wokest industries out there and if I publish something that doesn't fit with their little cultural paradigm Or doesn't go into their diversity equity and inclusion policy They could fire me and I could never work another day in my life because of an opinion I have outside of work Gotta fight for the First Amendment friends in all contexts in all kinds of ways will Keep the skies safe. My friend. Thanks so much clay There's this little hunter Biden thing about maybe covering his family's expenses in the New York Post, you know Joe Biden his family their expenses. I think we should talk about it. Let's do it Play Travis and bucks exon On the front lines of truth"
