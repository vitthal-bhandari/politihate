    "text": " Politics without the soap opera with unfiltered constitutional conservative truth. The conservative review with Daniel Burns. And welcome back fellow American patriots and Minimans standing at the ready to fight anew on life, liberty, property and everything in between. And boys, they're everything from the border to traineeism to the debt ceiling to our very existence, essentially human beings. They're unleashing more therapeutic jihad upon us into our bodies. We need men of the times who know what ought to be done. But we've been lacking that for quite some time. But today is going to be D-Day as in Descentis Day. He is getting in the race. We've been talking about why that matters, why it doesn't and what way it benefits us and what way it doesn't. We'll be having a special guest at the Descentis Surrogate, big ally, discuss and making the case why it should matter, but particularly in what way it matters. To me, no matter what, what this signals is that after eight years of our movement being hijacked, we will finally at least have the closest thing we've had in a generation to someone believing and articulating our views, what ought to be done on the issues of the day, at least giving voice to COVID fascism. We don't even have that anymore. And obviously, Descentis has been doing that. We need someone on the debt ceiling. We need someone on the trainee issues. Like I mentioned, immigration, you name it. There is a lot going on. So we're going to get to that a little bit later. First off, a lot of things I want to lay out here on the docket. I want to talk about this target business because this is really, I mean, you want to talk about something that matters more than the presidential elections. If we have the ability to really do what the left does and weaponize boycotts, this is important. This is very important choosing right. And by the way, that begins with our sponsor today. To my knowledge, there is only one guaranteed conservative company that sells eyewear in America. And that is our friends at Better Spectacles. They're rodent stock, biometric, intel glasses. What does intel glasses mean? Believe it or not, you see with your brain every bit as much as you see with your eyes. Our brains are constantly sensing what's around us. Now on what we see not only depends on the strength of our own eyes, but also helps the brain make optimal decisions. That's why you need as much of your vision field and peripheral vision to in order to think straight. I mean, if you're like me and your neurosight, you take your glasses off. You can't function. So likewise, you might have glasses, but if they're not operating at an optimal level, well, you'll be less intelligent. So that's why I recommend you do what I did and go to better spectacles.com slash conservative. What happens? You schedule a teleoptical appointment. They measure it online. It's pretty unbelievable. They measure the fit. You get 61% off and you will get visual acuity like you've never seen before. That's how we are on the ball here because my rodent stock frame is from Better Spectacles at Better Spectacles.com slash conservative. So for the first time in a generation, we are finally seeing ourselves turn the corner on a cultural issue. The polling shows this that we are pushing back against the rainbow jihad, the craziness, you know, the last couple of years every time and it gets earlier and earlier, they gear up for this arbitrary designation of June as the Sodom and Gomara pride month and just moon and groom us with the most disgusting, satanic, demonic, licentious behavior. And it's everywhere and we just sit back and take it. And you even have conservatives over the years of pride month. They start echoing their terminology. It started with Bud Light and now we're nipping target in the bud and they announced that some of their satanic merchandise of, you know, penis inducing bikinis or whatever that they were putting out, you know, at the front of their store, they're going to start to take away because of the blowback. And, and the squeaky wheel gets oil. This is how the left was able to take a two percent movement and make it ubiquitous in every county and state in the country. We need to do the same. It's obviously a lot more than two percent. We have a majority support. We have to show them that they will pay a price. Remember, until now, if you had a corporation, you can never go far enough to the left. The right might be upset about it, but I'm going to do anything to you, but the left will kill you if you don't do what they say. We have to create equal and opposing force. This is a very positive development, but wouldn't it be nice to have a national advocate? It was that we talked about yesterday, a megaphone, a leader giving voice to things like this. I could tell you. So long as Trump defines our movement, defines America first, you will not have an effective fight. Literally, we saw Don Jr. say you, you know, cut it out fighting against Bud Light. Again, that is how it matters. Like some of them say, Daniel, these type of fights would target. That's more important than presidential election. I agree. But the problem is because the presidential election looms large in everything in politics, as long as Trump is our voice, we're screwed. And by the way, I just want to say, speaking of, you know, the hijacking of our movement, you go back to my writings. I was using America first long before he came about. He borrowed a lot of our terminology, and I don't want to get into that. But just this notion that somehow he created it, he hijacked it and retarded and inhibited our movement and co-opted it into a controlled opposition. So I for one and happy that at a minimum, we have competition and a way to move on. But folks, this is where it is. We have a once in a lifetime opportunity to push back against the rainbow geot. Typically the other side pushes too far. There's a little bit of a blowback and we have a little bit of a fight, but then we drop it. That's what happened with gay marriage. We fought it. Thirty states, you know, barred it, but then we just dropped it. You have to stick the landing here and we have to see this through. And that's why we need to make it clear that we will not tell it's not just, oh, just don't harm my religious, don't force my religious institution to do it. No, if we see you promoting it, we're going to go after you. That is hate speech. That is offensive. That is sick and we're not going to tolerate it. Done. That's how it is. Okay. Moving on. Again, I just want to get a bunch of things off the docket here because obviously this announcement is going to suck up a lot of the oxygen. Texas. Texas, we couldn't get a single one of Bob Hall's medical freedom bills to the floor. We couldn't even get Brian Harrison's bill, HB 81, the COVID vaccine freedom act, which only bars COVID vaccines from being mandated. Okay. I mean, that's pretty simple. It doesn't even take it off the market and can't even get a vote. Can't even get a vote. So with that border bill, we talked about this deportation force. They took out the explicit language authorizing the new state level border protection force to repel and remove those attempting to cross the border. So again, you could create another force parallel to Texas DPS and the National Guard. But if you don't allow them to repel, it's just the same thing. So again, there's no leadership from, from the governor and look, there's no pressure from on top because Trump is not making these play calls. This again, I'm just going to tell you, I could say it's more important to focus on the state legislators, focus on the issues, focus on, you know, the cultural kind of private sector fights. It's all true. And I'm going to continue doing that. But we're losing who we're not winning them. We don't have a voice and we have a negative voice. This is the problem. I mean, in a state like Texas, I don't know what to do. We cannot get basic things passed in a state like Texas. One other thing here. Last week, Glenn Beck laid out the case against the Biden crime family, the level of corruption that ties to the ties to China. It's called the reckoning. And it's just a really good resource. We hope to do this more often. These special deep dives, you know, we did it with Glenn did one on the creation of COVID. We did one with Stephen Saragansales on vaccine injury, these deep dive broadcasts. So he has a website, the reckoning guide.com. I just wanted to flag for you guys, the reckoning guide.com to basically collate all the information, the top lines on the Biden crime and what state attorneys general and prosecutors can do. You know, we've been talking about, oh, you know, Trump, Trump, Trump, they're persecuting their prosecuting him. And I'm like, what's your action item other than just elevating his prominence so he could win the nomination? Do something with it. And we talked about the need to protect people in blue jurisdictions from politically motivated juries and things like that, expanding the jury pool. We talked about red states defending their citizens, having a legal defense fund for those people. But then there is another important action item that red states need to do the same thing to bite in. You got to fight fire with fire. And there there really is terrible criminal activity. So on the website, the reckoning guide.com talks about the need, you know, what different local and state prosecutors can be doing to do Alvin Bragg in reverse, but actually following the law. So that is another important action item that again, you know, this super sees any thing. If you support Trump or the sanders or whatever, I mean, we should all agree this is what needs to be done to deter this one sided weaponization of politics where they could commit real crimes, but they'll go after Republicans who who don't. So that's the reckoning guide.com. I'm going to have more on illegal, well, maybe we'll cover illegal immigration a little bit tomorrow, but mainly I will have more on COVID stuff, medical freedom. We're going to have Peter McCullough on as well. Just a couple more things here on this trainee, just the importance, the crossroads, the precipice that we're at. First our next sponsor again, and it's not just a sponsor, but it's an action item. Jase medical. I just saw, oh man, I forgot the statistics, but the numbers got even worse with the percentage of the top 300 medications and shortage. This stuff's getting real. Jase medical, they offered the Jase case for antibiotics, but now they also have a product for you to get a full year supply of your vital prescriptions. So let's say you have a supply, some people take, you know, mental health, blood pressure, you name it, cardiac diabetes, and they will offer you a 12 month backup supply to give you that peace of mind when the stuff hits the fan. You go to Jasemedical.com enter promo code review. Cindy, one of our listeners emails me that the processing was extremely easy filling out the questionnaire online, and she said for her five annual scripts, her total was $256. So that's actually pretty good paying out of pocket. Again, J-A-S-E medical.com, that's Jasemedical.com, enter code review for a discount. So the American Principles Project, I'm not sure who they are, but it's an allied organization, their warning parents across the US of the possibility of their parental rights being stripped away from them as recent legislation in California and Minnesota moved to give state family courts the power to take basically take away custody if you don't allow the kid access to balls cutting in breast removal. And it just reminds me like this is the precipice we're at. The left is dead serious. They will take this to a level that we couldn't imagine. But on the other hand, because they're so radical beyond where the overton window will sustain their political gains, the public is with us. And we need to floor the gas pump. Not just the don't screw up female sports. You know, the whole Trump-Bruce Jenner thing that we love the tranny community, trannyism is natural. Homosexuality is amazing. But you know, just don't screw up female sports. No. Now is the time to educate people even on the things that our side started to kind of wear down on maybe times of change. Really? You just like quadruple the amount of homosexuals and quintuple the amount of people that switch hit in a matter of a few years. That's totally natural. It is all coming from this concerted psychological warfare that at the top levels of the deep state, there's a deep public state, there's a deep private state. They're all working together when government created this monopoly with these corporations. It's not just an economic monopoly, but they did it to create a cultural monopoly to monopolize the public square so they have a free lane to groom people into whatever they want. We need to fight the corporations. We need to ban this indecency. We need to ban the drag shows, the bathroom stuff, all of it, all of it. Plow the ground under it. Run heavy on this issue. And that's one thing I'm going to be looking for in the next week or two is, you know, Desantis rolls out his campaign and presumably makes stops in the earliest states. This should be a priority. And I know it's tough. It's like, gosh, which thing do you promote? We're on our border, civilization, culture, bodies, self-evident truths. Who knows, economy, inflation, energy. I mean, it's just unbelievable when you consider what we fought a revolution for relative to what we're dealing with now. It's like, yeah, there's a couple of taxes on tea and paper. That's all it was. Those are founders understood. Nip the shoots of arbitrary power in the bud, where shall we say, in the bud light. So there's that. There's also, um, where is this here? I'm playing this here. This clip I got. The American Medical Association, they've officially called for newborns, not to be signed, sex assigned until they can decide for themselves what their sex is. This is, it's just unbelievable. The AMA, the AMA is another organization that we need to audit every way the feds and the states subsidize or empower them. And that needs to be choked off. This is really how it works, by the way. This is what venture socialism is. They take taxpayer funding and fund all this stuff. And then suddenly you find in the culture like, well, it's a private organization, Daniel, that they, you know, that's just competing in the market of ideas. They seem to be winning. No, you know, it's interesting. Where did I see this Aaron Siri, our, you know, famed medical freedom lawyer we've had him on a couple of times. He put out a table here of Pfizer donations to universities in 2021. Rutgers, two million Hopkins and Boston University, University of New Mexico got almost a million apiece. University of California, 612,000 per university, 563,000 Mayo Clinic, 802,000 Cleveland Clinic, 600,000 mass general 539. So you get what we're going at American, so that the hospitals and universities, then all of the associations, American gastroenterology association, American College of Allergy As Menimmunology, American Academy of Physician Assistance, Rheumatology Nurses Society, Cancer Care, Co-Payment Assistance Foundation. So that cancer foundation, and this is really sick given the amount of cancer that the shots have caused, Pfizer donated 24 million, 24 million. Obviously, they roped in American Heart Association and College of Cardiology. Unbelievable. Now you might say, well, it's, you know, Pfizer's a private entity. No, they got all that money, that extra money that they could throw around to promote their product from our government. So our government promotes the product. Our government mandates the product. Our government puts it on a schedule. But then our government also funds all of the cultural, you know, institutional, medical associations and institutions to fund their product as well. All paid for by you, whether it's your tax money or your blood, sweat, and toil because of the inflation of the printed money. We need an advocate. The point is, in these 20 minutes, I just tried to give over to you just a synopsis of the gravity of the times we live in. We don't have time to argue over polls. We don't have time to argue over cable personalities. We don't have time to argue over who has bigger crowd size or these like kindergarten pissing matches on Trump social. We just don't have the time. And that's why folks, we're going to discuss today in what way DeSantis announcing can help this stuff or not. But either way, I'm going to continue focusing on my issues. I'll guarantee you one thing. If DeSantis comes out one day and says, you know what? I think it's a good idea to raise the debt limit. I think it's a good idea to, you know, I don't know, loosen asylum laws, whatever. I'm not going to be like, Oh, yeah, that's actually a good idea. You know, I don't change. You know, but at the same time, when you do have someone fighting for you and you have no one else, you got to see how to utilize that. So I want to talk about this with our guest. Our interview today is sponsored by our friends at barrel buddy.com. Barrel buddy is a cartridge that you jam through your barrel of your gun when you want to clean it. And it is a novel concept that scrubs and collects the carbon particulates and then absorbs any remaining residue and buffs the interior surface clean. It also is a double action because while it gets out the gunk, the squeezing, you first put the solvent around it so it cleans it. You get a nice uniform application. Then you could put another cartridge into have a nice uniform lubricant and boom, put it back together. Clean your firearm. Don't be one of those, uh, slubs that don't clean their guns like those who don't take showers. You got to give your gun the bath. It needs jam a round peg, not a square peg, not a, a bore snake or a, you know, one of these, um, little cloths that shed and leave lint in your barrel, which is the last thing you want, put a nicely designed round peg and a round hole. Clean bucks for 50 barrel buddies. It comes in, uh, the caliber that you'll need 945-357 Magnum. Barrel buddy.com today is where to go again. Barrel buddy.com clean your gun the American way. So later today, Ron DeSantis is finally announcing his run for president and shockingly in a very non traditional method, it's not going to be this big rally or a sermon on the mount sort of speech. It's going to be this Twitter space forum. I don't even know how to use Twitter space, but together with Elon Musk and he's going to field questions, live questions that, uh, Musk and David Sachs, the other person who will be there, um, moderating it and DeSantis will just field questions. And that's how he's introducing himself to the public. So I wanted to delve into just the choice of, of his venue, what the significance is because obviously we're on the other side of his announcement. So we don't know yet what he's going to say. We'll analyze that tomorrow, but I want to discuss this and how it fits in just with the broader theme we've been banging away at this week. In what way does the presidential election matter and not matter? And what way does DeSantis matter and not matter? Is it too late? Is this a distraction anyway? Okay. There's a lot to go through there. There's a lot to unpack. How does DeSantis himself operate? What should we expect? Um, there's a lot to delve into and there's a lot of people I could have on, but there's one person I've never had on shockingly. And it's a mistake. A friend of mine, David Reiboy. He's a fellow at the Claremont Institute. We talk a lot and he's one of the few deep thinkers in our movement actually trying to ascertain who we are and where are we headed. He writes at late republic nonsense. Is this a sub stack late republic nonsense? He's frequently a guest on media, particularly about foreign policy and national security, which I might want to get to vis-a-vis DeSantis. He's also also a big advocate of national divorce, which is very important as well to this discussion. Follow him on Twitter at Dave Reiboy. That's Dave, R-E-A-B-O-I and his website is Dave Reiboy.com. Hey, Dave, I can't believe it's taken a decade, but here you are. Welcome for the first time. Uh, yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much. I feel like we do a podcast at least a couple times a week, but nobody's recording. So this is great. I figure we as well do that. And I think you're the perfect person. I would call you sort of a DeSantis surrogate in the sense that you're, you know, you've been promoting him for several months on online, doing battle with the Trump people. So you feel very passionate. So I want to get into, you know, why you support him a little bit afterwards. But first, the significance of today. I'm not a huge fan of Elon Musk. I think he is genuine in the sense that like kind of like Naomi Wolf and RFK, they've had a revelation based on what's going on and they certainly understand the left is crazy. So they've moved over, but they're not exactly who you and I are. So I don't fully trust them. Why is he doing this and is it a good move? Well, I think it's a great move. I think, I mean, first it represents DeSantis getting inside Trump's Uda loop and it was something that is kind of totally out of the box. And look, I mean, nobody remembers announcement speeches. They may remember, let's say iconic artifacts from the speech like Trump coming down the escalator at Trump Tower or things like that. So I think turning this into an unusual event is a good thing. It shows them thinking outside the box. And as far as Musk is concerned, yeah, I mean, I agree with you. He's not one of us. But I think that kind of leads to something really important too, which is that DeSantis has this unique ability to connect with people who ordinarily would not support someone who is, you know, by any account, a very right wing politician. Trump on the other hand is a guy who is actually a quite moderate politician, but makes people think that he is, you know, he's like all the negatives of, you know, some far right guy with none of the positives and DeSantis is kind of flip that on its head. And I think a lot of that has to do with him being kind of essentially normal in his personal affect. And also the competence and intelligence. I mean, I saw an article where that talked about the governor meeting with Elon during COVID and it said that, you know, they both geeked out about, you know, about the different data points, the different data. Yeah. And so it's like, you know, you're going to see it through, it's not just kind of posturing that you're never going to land the or stick the landing. So I think that that's important. What do you think about the media aspect of this? The fact that he's circumventing the media where typically you would call upon and hey, I'm go down to my hometown and fall down to the media. The media where typically you would call upon and hey, I'm go down to my hometown in Florida, come out and cover my event. Here is like he's going directly around the people. So what I find interesting here, and I want to get your comment on this, that his media strategy is almost the way he is on policy on policy. We have Republicans that say one thing, but then they do the opposite when the leverage points actually come due to affect that change. But he actually follows through with it, at least more than any other politician we've seen that has risen to that level of prominence. But then the media things the same thing. What's conservative media? What's Republican politics the last generation? The media, the media, the media is terrible. And the media is horrible. They're not, you know, reporters. They're part of the Democrat party. Okay. What the question begs, what the heck are you going to do about it? Same thing. We have an invasion at the border. Okay. So then you have an obligation to treat like an invasion. Okay. You know, but then our actions don't match our rhetoric. So he's, you know, we all say the media is terrible. So he actually takes it hard. I was like, yeah, you know what? I'm going to cut them out. And then the Trump people attack him for like, you're incompetent, not properly dealing with the media. What's going on there with the dichotomy of media strategy between the two camps? Well, one of the things that Trump did very, very poorly during his four years in the White House was, you know, he depended solely on mainstream media and he gave them legitimacy. And he did this sort of while ignoring friendly media on the right. I mean, he had an opportunity. He had the golden opportunity to promote, to promote conservative media and, you know, his allies there into real superstars. I mean, sure, it happened a little here and there. But at the end of the day, when he needed to do something really important, the leaks went to the New York Times. They went to the Washington Post. They went to all of the usual places. And that's not even getting into how many, you know, administration officials couldn't wait to run to the Daily Beast and the New Yorker, et cetera. So I think, I mean, there have been a number of Florida outlets, you know, Florida's voice and things like that that have popped up recently. And I think it's because folks down here recognized that, hey, you know, why are we depending on mainstream media to cover the things that are happening in Florida? You know, why are we allowing these issues to be owned by horrible papers like the San Sentinel and the Miami Herald and, you know, on and on? Why don't we actually have people on the ground doing real reporting? And, you know, wow, it's amazing that nobody actually thought of that. Instead, conservative media loves to run around and basically be, you know, everyone is George Will. Everyone is talking about how smart they are and how insightful. And I get it. I mean, we have a lot of smart and insightful people. But at the end of the day, an ecosystem relies on a news ecosystem relies on actual reporting and reporters and dealing with them fairly. And from the point of view of DeSantis, who is actually he and his team have been very good about dealing with the media, I mean, you have to teach them how to, you know, you have to teach them how to act. You have to teach them how to behave. And that means that like a child, you have to set them limits. And the way that he's done that throughout his term in office, I mean, especially starting with COVID, I think has been admirable. No, I mean, we definitely see that where he doesn't just say we need to cut them out and then rely on them when he needs them. He literally cuts them out and it's like, it's a it's a it's a freeze down. Like you said, empowering our own people. I found interesting that he's given every once in a while, you see these exclusives pop up with him. There aren't that many at least now that will be more obviously. And what are them like with a guy like Neil Monroe from Breitbart? So on immigration policy, Neil's been writing for over a decade. He's interviewed me a lot and he's a true, true believer in immigration limitations, restrictions, you know, the Breitbart management, there's something different there, but he's still kind of true to his beliefs. And so, hey, I want to talk about immigration. I'll go to Neil Monroe. I mean, and that's a thing. He'll actually live, not just espouse, but he'll live it. He'll implement. He'll, he'll, he'll create that parallel. That's another thing I like. Another thing I think this whole, um, Elon Musk thing speaks to is his political acuity. So I don't particularly like him and I don't like some of his ventures and the venture socialism and electric car stuff. And I think a lot of it got started because of government. But the bottom line is there was a poll that came out recently of fave, unfave among Republican voters of different public figures. Right. And Elon by far was the most favorable. Be it as it may, if you want to win, that is an interesting idea. One of my, I wouldn't say criticisms and I, I've never, I don't know if I've ever shared this with you and I certainly haven't shared it with the audience, but obviously everyone knows I worked with him in Congress, kind of the same way I work with Chip and Massey and Andy Biggs when he was there. He was on, on house judiciary, particularly issues like immigration. And he was miserable because you know, you had Boehner and then Ryan, it was just terrible times. The Republican leadership is like, screw that. I'm going to run for governor of Florida. And now I have a penchant for telling people not to run like you're going to ruin your life. It's not worth it. The country's a mega infested carcass. Don't do it. That's what I told Chip. I didn't tell him that because it was a step up. I mean, you're already in Congress, so it's better to run for governor. But deep down, I was thinking like, yeah, right. This guy is like Calvin Coolidge. He reads the federalist papers. I love him. You'd love him. But there's no way a guy like that typically, we don't have people that are that have that much courage, commitment, smart on, on policy dedicated to our vision that are good at politics. So it's like, okay, really, you're going to run for the governor of the third largest state, very expensive media market. Where are you going to get the money from? Because I just come off of several election cycles where every one of our guys lose. We can never raise the money put together an organization. We get crushed. But you know, I mean, he's surprised this time and again. He won the primary, then he won the general in an election year where equivalent states were seeing Democrats win every general in that position. And look, I mean, here he is of time and again, kind of surprising us. So going forward, I mean, here's my question. This is a guy. He reminds me a lot of Calvin Coolidge, you know, just kind of down to business. Here's what I believe. Here's what we're going to do. Do you think America is ready for a person like that, the America we have in this day and age? Wow. What a question. I mean, I think we better be ready because the alternative is really terrible. I think that at the end of the day, what it comes down to is that we have a chance here to reward DeSantis's image of ruthless competence while not pandering at all. And this is something that the American right, I think, needs to adopt or else it's just going to be crushed at all levels. I don't think there's a future for the American right at all if it can't execute on its agenda. And even worse, if it doesn't want to. I mean, I think what we're seeing now is that we're seeing candidates and elements of the GOP base that really don't care about anything. They want to be seen. They want their rage and anger kind of mirrored back at them. And I get that impulse, but unfortunately, it's not enough. I mean, it doesn't do anything for your quality of life. And importantly, it doesn't protect you at all from the left. And the other thing is it guarantees that you will not build a movement that attracts anyone but demagogues and grifters and folks who are invested financially and reputationally and telling you how horrible things are and how nothing can ever be fixed. And they see a guy coming down the road who has scored tangible wins and executes ruthlessly. It kind of freaks people out because it upsets the apple cart because, hey, that's not part of our narrative. Our narrative is that we lose and we all go off to the camps next year. And a lot of people are kind of invested in that, both financially in some cases, as we see on Twitter and in other places, but also kind of emotionally. I mean, I get it. I get the doomer thing. And I know that you wanted to talk about this as like, does any of this matter? David, let's do this. So you're starting to answer the question before I ask it. But the reason why I chose you more than anyone else on a day like today is because I know you share my passion in national divorce. And we've already defined what that does and doesn't mean and, you know, where it's a little bit and big and there was some degree of ambiguous nature as to where it's going to land, but at least embarking on the fact that we are going to take our areas and go where we want. So look, here's my question to you. You and I believe the same thing that essentially we're coming at least the generation too late and certainly the last five to 10 years. You look at whether it's the spending, the dependency, the culture, the demographics, you name it, the weaponization of our agencies that I think you and I couldn't have imagined even a few years ago, what we found out about basically the fourth Reich. I mean, our government's a bigger threat to us than anything. To me, I view the federal government as not something that needs to be fixed because it just won't be, but something that we need to defeat and almost protect ourselves from. And that's why I've been pushing kind of this Florida model. You take a guy like DeSantis and at the end of the day, will this give us false hope that all somehow, you know, we could change things 10 years ago, I would have been dancing from the rooftops. Like this would be a national holiday for me that because typically we would have the worst Republicans be the front runner for present. And here you have like, you know, I love people like Alan Keys, but you know, he never had a chance to go the distance. Here you have a guy like this that has all the qualities, the heart, the brain, the implementation, their ability to raise money and organize in the record, um, articulation, and he could go the distance potentially. Oh my gosh, this is just, this is amazing. And there's a part of me that I am excited and I don't shy away from that. But at the same time, Dave, I mean, what are, what do we expect to accomplish with him as president, given that we're coming into this so late. And are we just distracting from our goal of making red States red again and having that Noah's arc sanctuary from the federal government rather than a picket's charge and ill-fated attempt at fixing the federal government? Right. Well, I mean, two things, maybe more than two. But I'll just say that, um, you know, I deal with this all the time with friends. There's a discussion that I've had, um, you know, on and on in, uh, with, with, with folks who kind of see things the way, uh, the way we do and are big admirers of, uh, of Governor DeSantis. You know, they'll say, um, you know, they'll be kind of faithless about it. They'll say all the, this country is too far gone. The state of disunion is far too advanced to make anything, uh, uh, real possible, any real change possible. Um, you know, or on the other hand, you have people who say that the Democrats voter fraud and election fortification, um, efforts are so great. Uh, they've gotten so good at it that any Republican is basically unelectable and, you know, all resistances fuel anyway. They'll never let a Republican win again. And I mean, I understand, you know, thinking that I, I, I, I get it. Things sure look bleak. Um, I think the black pill is seductive because it's comfortable. Uh, you know, you can sit back and, and keep moaning and being hopeless, but, um, by refusing to fight at all, I mean, in the end, you'll guarantee a loss. And, uh, and that's, you know, that's, that's completely guaranteed. But I mean, I don't, I don't want to be Pollyanna, Pollyanna is about it. Um, but I think that, um, you know, the black pill is actually a white pill. Um, yes, the option to return to the past is, is, is, is not going to happen. You know, we're, we're a different country now. Um, even aside from demographics, uh, kind of ideologically we're in a far more polarized, crazy place. Um, you know, millions of Americans believe in saying things. Uh, we both loathe each other. And I think for very good reason, um, because our worldviews are incompatible. Okay. So that said what, you know, what next then, um, I still think that, um, that it's worth supporting, um, DeSantis. Um, and I'll say, and I, as I say to my friends, even if voter fraud is insurmountable and will lose and, you know, it's all over anyway. I mean, look, if you, if you think it's all over anyway, then, then I would suggest finding a good hobby that you really enjoy or go play with your kids or go do something that brings you joy and satisfaction in your daily life. Um, you know, as opposed to something so dark. I mean, if you really think there's no hope, then, you know, be, make like Noah and, and, uh, and, you know, and build an arc. Um, but I suspect that a lot of people kind of think that, you know, they'll say that, but I don't think they really believe it. Um, but in the off chance that they do believe it, um, I think DeSantis is a much better bet, even if he will lose because at the end of the day, um, the US presidential election is the world's most power, you know, most biggest, most powerful public education project. Mm. Um, every four years, uh, you know, everyone's attention turns to the campaign. And even if there's name calling and all kinds of insults and nonsense, um, there is talk about the issues and though the issues that, that people talk about, um, are ones that resonate with the public and, um, a strong candidate has the ability to shift the conversation on major issues and, and to define what is important for the country. I mean, Trump did this in 2016 when he was talking about immigration trade and war. And he was able to completely up end like 20 years of GOP orthodoxy. You know, he was one guy who was saying things that, um, that, you know, all 15 of his opponents, you know, thought were crazy. I mean, you had the commentary saying like, you know, how is this guy, you know, standing up there and saying these things that, you know, national review and the Wall Street Journal and every other magazine was calling crazy for, for, uh, you know, for, for, for 20 years. Um, and yet he won because of those things, not, not, uh, despite them. And, and for that reason, he created a new baseline in, um, uh, in, in the GOP and the American right, you know, these are now things that, I mean, nobody was talking, you know, sure people were talking about immigration. Um, but hey, it was Bush who was pushing on amnesty. Um, and that's how I feel now with things like vaccines and medical freedom is that I could be saying, all I want is, I don't care about the federal election. Let's just focus on the GOP, super majorities and make sure we pass things like medical freedom. But as I mentioned before, you came on, we can't even get a basic COVID vaccine mandate bill passed in the Texas legislature. We're, you know, I could say we should be doing things, but we're not. We're not. And the reason we're not is because the GOP is, is now a mix of the traditional kind of Mitch McConnell Republicans and then this side of, uh, at least the fanic Trump grifters that will glum on to some of his branding, but certainly won't stick the landing and then often actually join with the McConnell types on policy. So we're just left with that. So you're saying that if someone will say, look, you know, I don't care about the presidential, make red States red again and, and the more red pilled, so to speak, the red States are the more it will push us into going our separate ways, which is really what we think needs to happen. But what you're saying is that you can't even have that until you red pill our elected representation in those States and you're not going to have that with the current GOP leadership. Right. Yeah. I mean, I agree with that and, and, uh, and replacing, um, replacing an ineffective moderate, uh, like Trump, who at the end of the day is he's just, you know, he's, he's, he's, you know, the only thing that sets him apart from the GOP establishment is mean tweets at this point. Um, and, uh, and, and frankly the, the old line corporatist GOP establishment loves that because like they'll take mean tweets all day long if they continue, if they, you know, if, if what they get, it doesn't get into their lane. They get to monopolize policy. I keep telling people this because this is my expertise and I worked on primaries for so many years. We have actually regressed in our ability to win primaries. We, we were starting to gain traction 2012, 2014 after tea party. We'd still lose most of the time gradually, you know, our winning percentage was increasing, but he just nuked that. And in several ways, one distraction, another is downright endorsing their candidates, you know, more often than he endorses the right ones. And you look back and I tell people, look at the panoply of GOP governors and senators and you cannot tell me that we've advanced the ball forward. It's not even like a Trump version of populism. That's maybe not quite where you and I am, but certainly is different than the G. No, it's the same old. Yeah. It's not even sincere. None of that stuff is sincere. I mean, this, this gets us to what I think is the big issue. I mean, this is why I'm, you know, I, I don't think it's a, I don't think it's an accident that some of the biggest DeSantis supporters are here in Florida where I live because we kind of have gotten a first front row seat to seeing this and, and you know, folks who are not in Florida or, you know, we're not like, like you kind of, you know, involved in, in what goes on in Tallahassee. I, you know, they don't see it and, and then they don't appreciate it. And I think it'll be the, the goal of the campaign to sort of translate that and tell that story to, to America, at least to GOP voters. But as far as I'm concerned, there's really only one issue that matters in, in this election and going forward. And, and it's the effective and creative use of state power to defend our citizens from the left's assault, not only in government, but in the civil societies that have institutes institutions that have been totally captured by the left. It's education, media, big business, big tech, the legal and medical establishment, entertainment, you know, I mean, all these forces are marshaled against us with a very strong ideological, you know, enforcement mechanism. They're, they're, they're, they want to use their immense power to flatten our voices and, and frankly, to push us from society. And the, the, the right in America has, you know, it's, it's, we've got two ways to go. On one hand is the old line, you know, Republican approach, which is, you know, sort of corporatists, but, you know, let's, let's sort of be nice about it and put it into ideological terms, give them the benefit of the doubt and, and say that these are kind of value neutral libertarians, you know, especially where corporations and their core campaign donations are concerned. But like, you know, David French, you know, why does David French tell us that drag queen story hours a blessing of liberty? You know, I mean, it sounded crazy, but it's because he thinks that the state, meaning us, our citizens have no interest in the devolution of society. Yeah. You know, and we're just going to have to live with ever increasing degeneracy, shove down our throats because of, you know, his, his, his lofty principles about individual liberty. And many of us on the right now understand that it's that position is a recipe for losing our civilization. Um, but, but don't the Trump people seem to get that? Well, yes, exactly. You know, that's, that's exactly it. I mean, it's not only Kristi Noem and, and, and, and, and Asa Hutchinson, who, uh, you know, will, you know, for, for big corporations shows up and says, Hey, don't pass this right wing law because, you know, we'll boycott your state and take all our employees out. You know, I mean, they'll fold like a cheap camera. Um, but yeah, I mean, he's going to fight. He's going to use the deep state. No, no, but I mean, as I said, aside from the mean tweets, this is Trump too. You know, his, his outside or image just disguises a totally conventional corporate is Republican. I mean, I'm not even giving him the benefit of the doubt saying that it's actually an ideological libertarian position because obviously it's not. Um, the fact that he doesn't seem to understand what this debate is all about. I mean, that doesn't matter. You know, he's shown that seems to be the type of guy that's like, look, and some people are thinking that he sided with Disney just to own DeSantis. There's no, that whatever DeSantis says, he's going to say the opposite. But I don't think that's fully true. There's a kernel of truth to that. I think if you look at the way he operated as present, he genuinely is. And it's so ironic because he is literally the opposite of what some of his supporters project on him. He is a very much a system stability guy. He's like, look, this is a fixed institution, America, Disney. Why are you pissing on them? You know, there's jobs at stake. He actually does believe that a stock market, you don't want the stock market to go down. That's why he had to do the COVID stuff. You know, we have to print the money. He actually very much respects the system, except for the narrow sliver of it. And the narrow moment of it that it kind of personally attacks him, but systematically putting his own personal thing aside, he seems to respect it. Is that what you gather from Trump? Yeah. I mean, I think that's true to the extent that that any of this is thought through rather than just instinctual. Yeah. I mean, I think that's it. You know, he'll he'll be very comfortable and look at even before he was president, I mean, look at his tweets about he's got tweets about every conceivable topic, usually where he's, you know, slamming a company or a person or, or, or, or, you know, or an institution or somebody. And, you know, oftentimes it's, it's, you know, for good reason. Um, but he thinks that, you know, just slamming them in public is enough. And obviously nobody cares. Um, it doesn't actually change behavior. Um, it's, uh, it's, it's, it's not much, you know, I mean, um, whoa, freeze frame. Yeah. It reminds me of something that I think is very important. I'm looking at these threatened, they're threatening to boycott Florida now and all this, you know, blowback. But the interesting thing is we already got the ball in the end zone. It's like you could fight after the game, but we want in other words, though, those, those drag performances are banned, you know, at least in front of minors. And now they're just, you know, closing up shop. You know what Trump, if Trump would have been Florida governor, you know, you would have gotten, he would have maybe yelped about it. It would have mobilized them to have the biggest drag queen shows. And then he wouldn't have followed through with it because he's scared. And then you wind up with the negative efficacy where you get more drag shows than ever. Right. Right. No, of course, but, but people will have gotten the dopamine hit of seeing his tweets about it. And, you know, and they kind of move on to the next thing. And, yeah, I mean, that's that's that's this whole guy's mo. And, you know, I mean, I'm kind of sick of it. It's it's and it's it's not even. You know, he has never shown not once has he shown the the willingness to use the powers at his disposal to actually rain in the left. I mean, if he didn't do it for four years, you know, why would he start now? You know, as he's he's attacking DeSantis for for for for Disney, you know, he did jailbreak, his willingness to do amnesty. I mean, he's embraced the key tenants of gender ideology from which everything else, you know, all the terrible things. Well, I am very I've been talking about this a lot of you, you know, about it. I am very disturbed because this is totally on brand for what Trump has perceived that he would be the most effective guy to get the right to boycott. I mean, he really that would be his thing. He's not such a, you know, a policy thinker, obviously. He's not going to on on policy outcomes, but kind of these quasi cultural battles. That's what people envision in him, but he's dead silent. His son dumped on the Bud Light fight. You got Bruce Jenner and Rick Greenell there, you know, pimping the homosexual agenda every second. And I guess using the the female bathroom there, or a barilago, it's like, what the heck? I mean, to me, that is very disturbing because one of the points I made earlier is that, look, if you're going to say the presidential election is not important. Well, what do you mean? Things like fighting target might be more impactful. I agree. But do you want a guy giving tailwinds to that or headwinds to that? Right. I mean, I don't, I don't think fighting target or Bud Light or, you know, frankly, even, you know, I mean, a lot of these things is, uh, I mean, that's not where the big fight is. I mean, that's, that's low lying, you know, that's low lying fruit. That's, that's, uh, that's kind of a, that's, that should be a gimme. Um, if you can't stand up and say, no, actually men or men and women are women and the entire, um, you know, the, the entire, uh, edifice on which gender ideology is based, which is that you can wake up and you can sort of, you know, define yourself and define, uh, you know, the most basic tenants of reality. Um, and then everyone is supposed to, uh, you know, genuine, flecked and agree with you. And, you know, thank you for sharing your truth. I mean, if you, if you can't oppose that, um, and oppose that strongly, I mean, DeSantis did, he was talking to Benny Johnson and he said, no, I'm not going to say that, that a man is a woman because it's obviously a lie. It's self-evident. It's not about the logistical problems of screwing up the rankings in female sports. I mean, if that is the thing, the female sport thing is, I mean, obviously, I think, you know, obviously I think men mentioned, mentioned competing in female sports. Yeah, of course. But like, if you're turning that into the fight, if you're saying that the extent to which we're going to fight this is, is, you know, stuff like that, um, then you're guaranteed to lose the big fight. Because at the end of the day, there are, you know, a thousand and one different, uh, scenarios like that that will pop up and, you know, eventually you will lose because as we go on, I mean, we've seen one of the, you know, one of the most terrifying things. I mean, I think that, um, um, I mean, the crazy part about all this is that I've long said that, um, that, uh, the whole Bruce Kaitlin Jenner thing, um, was a major factor or maybe not major, but it was a factor in Trump's victory in 2016. Because I think going through that in 2015 made people realize that this isn't really the same country that it was, you know, all of a sudden he pops up and then everybody, every institution, every media place, you know, um, is, is, is celebrating and affirming and saying it's wonderful. And, you know, God, God help you if you speak up and you say, no, this is, you know, this is ridiculous. What, what, you know, what the hell is this craziness? I mean, those people were shut down. They were, you know, they were sent from polite society. Um, there was really a sense at the time that, you know, um, it felt like, you know, the, the, the official truth changed. And the fact that the media was able to do this was tremendously scary. Um, I mean, I know I felt it myself. I was like, there's, there's, it's, it's very sinister the way the media was able to, uh, to take an issue and turn it into, um, you know, uh, a moral crusade, literally overnight. I mean, they, it used to take them decades to do this. And they did it literally overnight. They could get you to violate natural law. They can make it natural for every human being to wear a mask within a week in every setting, every time it is, it is very scary. And we need a bulwark, a messenger, a national advocate, a national megaphone. Now that alone is not going to do it. You got to build a movement. It's like saying, well, do you need a match or building a proper can fire from bottom up? We need to continue building that can fire, but we need a match at some point. And we don't, you know, we don't have that. And the question is, will Desantis be one? You seem to think that, that at least there's the potential there. And I, I definitely tend to agree. So again, people could follow you where at, uh, Dave Reboi on, um, on Twitter and, uh, and also the same, um, online and late republic nonsense, uh, is my sub stack. Um, but if you find me a Twitter, everything else will be revealed. Okay, folks. And you could find me at Daniel Horowitz at startmail.com. That is it for today. Thank you, Dave. And thank you all for tuning in. Let me know your comments, questions, and concerns till tomorrow. God bless you all. And thank you for listening."
