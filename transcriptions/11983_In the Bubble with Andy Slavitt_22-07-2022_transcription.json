We hardly know her, but baby we are determined to be her best friend. The dough is out now wherever you get your podcasts. Welcome to the Bubble. This is Andy Slavitt. It's Friday, July 22nd. Summer's flying by. So in the wake of the Dobbs Supreme Court case, it's interesting to note that there are about two and a half million unplanned pregnancies in the country every year. And a large portion of them, something like half, end up in abortion. And if I think back to when I first learned about how this whole getting someone pregnant process works, which I did at some young age, I think I remember that it requires two people, somebody to produce a sperm and somebody else to get pregnant. And by the way, I'm sure on this episode we will be referring to people as men and women in those traditional ways that many of us learned them, but it is important to point out that it is not the case always. There are people who identify as women that, of course, can get people pregnant. And the reverse is true that I don't mean to oversimplify. But the question still remains in the face of Roe. Why is one party, why is a person who gets pregnant 100% accountable for everything or often 100% accountable for everything? And is the culture shifting? Are there options to change? And that's what the conversation is about today. It took, it's probably, if I'm not mistaken, 50, 55 years since the pill came on the market, it would get plenty of other things, rings, IUDs, et cetera. Men do have, of course, birth control options, condoms, vasectomies. So given the fact that many women can't safely take birth control and given that they can often create side effects that are at a minimum unpleasant, it kind of begs the question, well, why can't this happen from the side of the sperm provider, the man in most situations here? And I think it's worth exploring and it's fascinating to me that the concept and the studies of male birth control have been around almost as long as the pill for almost four or five decades. I've got two guests on the show today who are both active in R&D around male contraception and both active thought leaders around the topic. Dr. Brian Nguyen was right down the road here at the University of Southern California, where he's the head of the Center for Male Contraception Development and Research. Welcome to the bubble, Brian. Handy, thanks for inviting me. I'm here in Pasadena. You could have come over, except I know you're on clinical call today. And Stephanie Page, who is at the University of Washington, an endocrinologist and a thought leader and someone who's been writing an awful lot about male contraceptives also on. You're a little bit up north from where we are. Welcome to the show. Thanks so much for having me, Andy. I look forward to the conversation. Stephanie, maybe we should just dig right in. You know, you and a colleague wrote a piece in the wake of Roe, getting overturned, which said that it's time for us to start putting the concept of the shared responsibility in male contraception on the table. Can you start by just explaining in your mind the connection between abortion rights and how they're disappearing in parts of the country and the work you're doing in male contraception? So the restriction on abortion that has come into play after since the DAWS decision really limits the access to safe abortion for millions of women in our country. And we know that the number one way to prevent unplanned pregnancy is with contraception. That's been shown time and time again. So the link really to the development of male contraceptives in the DAWS decision is trying to expand the option so that we can prevent unplanned pregnancies as best we can and minimize the loss of access to safe abortion. I just do want to be clear that even with expansion of contraception, we will always need access to safe abortion because no method is perfect. But nonetheless, it really is a call out to how do we both improve access to contraception and improve options? Well, you know, there's something really appealing about the idea of making it very clear that there is a shared responsibility here. And we should come back and talk about the impact we think this will have on unplanned pregnancies. But maybe you could just help, just give us a grounding if you would on how male contraception works. We'll walk us a little bit through the science. What various types of male contraception are being worked on and what is going on in some of the clinical trials, including the ones you're running? Sure. There's basically two different forms of male contraception. There's hormonal contraception and non-hormonal methods. And our group and Dr. Nguyen work mostly on development of hormonal contraception for men. So hormonal contraception for men works very similarly to hormonal contraception for women. The differences are that with women we're preventing ovulation for men, it's preventing the development of sperm. We are trying to develop them as a gel that people put on the skin every day as long-term injections and as implants, as well as a male pill. The current studies that we're doing are really focused on the contraceptive gel for men. And there's actually a trial going on right now sponsored by NIH and the Population Council, which is a global trial. So men in the United States, Europe, Africa, and South America are enrolling. And we hope to complete that trial in about a year's time. There are other studies that are going on developing the male pill that we're involved with as well as developing injections for men. These are slightly behind the gel in development, but nonetheless are in the pipeline. So what do we learn from the trials? Do we know how the effectiveness compares to female birth control? And what do we know about side effects from the hormonal contraceptives? So hormonal contraception for men has actually been in development for over 50 years. So we know a lot about the effectiveness and about the potential side effects. So in a clinical trial setting, so in the evaluation setting, these methods are about 95% effective. So very, very few pregnancies have occurred in the 2000 couples who've been enrolled in hormonal contraceptive trials. In terms of side effects, so as I said, this work's been going on for about 50 years and very similar to the development of the female pill. When these trials were first initiated, really high doses of hormones were used. And the side effect profile was quite similar to what we see in women. So some of the things that will be familiar to your listeners like changes in weight, acne, potential changes in mood and changes in sex drive. But as we've gone along in development and been able to minimize the hormonal doses and really more mimic what a man is naturally doing, the side effects have actually become very minimal. Yeah, side effects that I think you made clear that women have been putting up with for decades. And we'll talk a little bit about how the social reaction to those side effects for men. But Brian, just definitely saying that this is something that's been talked about or researched for 50 years. Why don't we have male contraception yet? Why do you think it hasn't happened? It doesn't sound like it's a science issue. It sounds like it must be more of a social issue or something to do with what the pharma companies see as the market. What's driving it? And before I answer that, actually, I wanted to go back to your question about differences in efficacy. Sure. One of the most unique aspects of hormonal male contraception is that we are trying to suppress men's sperm counts. In doing so, we regularly do testing of their sperm counts to let them know that they have zero sperm in their semen. And that's something that's very unique because when women take their birth control method, there is no marker or visible marker that allows us to know that their pill is working. And so when couples rely on the gel, they can be reassured that they are having upgraded in our course with zero sperm. Got it. So it sounds like we've got good science here yet to say hasn't happened. Tell us a little bit why you think that is. One of the reasons is that we've always prioritized female contraception because pregnancy is where pregnancy happens in the woman and the benefits have always outweighed the risk in the female population. In a healthy male, if they begin taking a medication, they can only incur side effects that can actually harm their health. Whereas for a female patient, if she does not take the method of contraception, then she could get pregnant, which we know is so much more risky in her body. So you've got to kind of count on men to not want to be responsible for creating another human being as enough motivation. And of course, you know, women have to be able to count on men to be that motivated and be able to take it regularly. I'm wondering in the trials that you've run, Brian, what are you hearing from men who are part of the experiment about why they want to be part of it? Not just the scientific results, but also kind of socially, how are people generally reacting? Yeah, that's a great question to ask. As part of our recruitment for individuals for the GEO trial, we actually speak to both the male partner and the female partner. And I love hearing what they have to say about what brought them to us in the first place. For a lot of men, I find that they have been in relationship with their partner for a prolonged period of time. And they've seen the different methods of birth control that their partners have used, and they've been frustrated, either frustrated with the experience of having to have an IUD placed and how uncomfortable that can be. It can be discomfort with side effects from hormonal contraception, or it can be just the inconvenience of having to go to the pharmacy and obtain their method. At some point, some men want to just relieve women of that burden. Even if it means trying out a new method, I'm always very impressed when men come to be with these reasons. Okay, let's take a break. When we come back, we're going to talk about whether or not male contraception is really going to make a difference in unplanned pregnancies, particularly given the changing cultural norms around relationships. We'll be back in a second. So, something I do actually pay a lot of attention to is my bed sheets. I only get so many hours of sleep at night, so I try to make them count. When I say I approve of a bed sheet, you know it's a real deal. I'm of course talking about cozy earth bamboo sheets. My God, you guys, these sheets have actually changed my sleep and changed my life. If my maybe two-in-pattic endorsement is enough, the cozy earth bamboo sheets are also endorsed by the one and only Oprah, and we all know how well she sleeps. The cozy earth's best-selling bamboo sheet set was named one of Oprah's favorite things in 2018. Huh, I'd like to get on that list. They also offer pillows and blankets, letting you deck out your whole bedroom in true luxury. Every time I slide into these sheets, I feel like I'm staying at a hotel. They're next level soft and so, so, so breathable. I don't like to feel too bummed up at night when I sleep in cozy earth's responsible, sourced, temperature-regulating bamboo, viscose bedding. It's perfect for me. So cozy earth provided an exclusive offer for our listeners today. Up to 35% off, site-wide when you use the code in the bubble, that's cozyearth.com and code in the bubble. Hey there, it's Mary Harris, and I host Slate's daily news podcast, What Next. It's a show I made because I was grappling with this question. Why is the news everywhere, and I have no idea what to pay attention to? My daily short podcast is here to help you make sense of things, from flushing out new angles to uncovering stories that have largely gone unreported. When the news feels overwhelming, I'm here to help you answer What Next. So subscribe wherever you're listening right now. So there's this sort of perception in society which paints men and probably the broad strokes, macho, sex-driven, non-compliant with healthcare, even their own health, let alone the health of their partner, ignorant, not necessarily very empathetic around women's issues. Are you seeing those perceptions bear out? Obviously you're dealing with a very self-selected population, people who have volunteered for this study, and so I wonder if you have any reflections either of you on whether or not what male acceptance more broadly might look like. I say that then that we currently see you're right, represent a very select group, but the fact that they come in with such conviction about how much they want to share their responsibility, it's actually very encouraging. I hope to manage some of the recruitment for our trials, and as more and more publicity comes out about male contraception, we probably get inquiries about the trial from all over the world at sites that we don't currently have a site yet. And just the volume of those inquiries from outside our centers just tells me that there's growing interest. Can I add to that also that certainly our patient experience, our participant experience, is very positive. So many men involved in our trials are disappointed when they're finished. They actually are wanting to continue to use the product, which we of course can't do in the context of it not being approved yet. And so I think we have that experience with our study volunteers who as you point out are selected, but there is broad-based survey data. There's market research data. There's scientific survey data from men across the multitude of countries that suggest these are hypothetical products, of course, that they are very interested in new novel male contraceptives. But again, that speaks, I think, to the idea that men are interested, and some men are interested actually in controlling their own fertility and ensuring that they don't father a pregnancy. So I think we're selling men short when we think of all men as being one type of behavior or having one type of motivation. Stephanie, what do we know what portion of unwanted pregnancies occur within monogamous relationships versus in whatever the non-monogamous relationship would be? I don't know whether that would be described as hook-up culture, but there's dates, just accidents. Do we really feel for that? So I think the best data that we have for that is what percentage of abortions occur in married couples, because of course we never know about monogamy and such. I believe that that number is about 25% of abortions occur within the context of marriage spry. Do you know? Yeah, actually the way I answer the question is that by absolute numbers, you have more unintended pregnancies among individuals who are in relationships and monogamous relationships. And the reason why is that number one, you're having more intercourse, number two, you're probably not using condoms at that point. So for those reasons, it's oftentimes in couples. What are the questions that the bags is the whole notion of trust in women's empowerment to take matters in their own hands? And I think in a married couple or a monogamous relationship, this idea of sharing the burden and the responsibility and the risk that you're pointing out feels right. And I'm encouraged to hear people are embracing it. When I think about all of the unwanted pregnancies that occur in other types of sexual relationships, it feels like that would require quite a big leap of faith for women to trust men to carry the burden of the contraception given that the woman, as you pointed out, Brian, are going to face a lot of the immediate consequences more directly. I respond by saying that one of the fallacies of male contraception and the use of male contraception is that if one partner uses it, that the other partner no longer has to use a method at all. Another paradigm is that both partners could use it. And that would respect the agency of both partners and the interests of both partners to protect themselves. Yeah, I think that it's a very important point. We know that there's a lot of unplanned pregnancy despite the fact that there's a lot of female contraception. So you alluded to a hookup culture before. That's a time when two contraceptives are going to be better than one. And in the context of monogamous relationship, sharing the burden of contraception is another way of looking at it. So there's also some survey data about trust, which is a huge issue. And many women, again, within the context of a committed monogamous relationship are willing to trust their partner. Hopefully that's earned in many cases. So I noticed you talked about your trials being funded by NIH. And what occurs to me is that what you didn't say is that they're being funded by pharmaceutical companies who if they see commercial applications, if they just be blunt, if they see money at the other end of this, if they see a market that people would use, would be making those investments. Does that indicate that pharmaceutical companies don't see a market here for some of the reasons that you probably both alluded to? Are they missing something? Are they wrong? How much is that a part of this equation? I mean, I think you're absolutely right. If they saw profits, they would invest. And it's always a risk benefit calculation. I think one of the things that's really tough is that this, whatever gets to the market first will be a first of its kind. And unfortunately, the regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and the European regulatory agencies have not really provided clear guidance as to how many couples for how long and so forth are going to need to be evaluated. So the cost of that investment is really unclear for the companies. So I think that's one piece. And I think the second piece is really trying to understand what the market is and what the uptake is. And it's so difficult when in most instances we're talking about a hypothetical. So you can do all the surveys you want, but is that going to pan out when men actually have access to the product? And I think there's just hesitancy when there's so much money to be made in other aspects of the pharmaceutical industry. Yeah, Brian, do you see the same? Or do you see any potential for interest? And also how important is it? How much more would this be the process up if there was an interest? Absolutely. I think that pharmaceutical support is absolutely essential for expanding our trials, improving our recruitment, giving us more manpower. It has been a huge barrier to development in the male contraception. And the contributing reason is this concern that there is just this greater risk benefit ratio whereby if for some reason there's an adverse event, a serious adverse event in a male user of this drug that the pharmaceutical company is going to be taking on a lot of risk for it. And there's also concern again that if a man uses it and the pharmaceutical company is the producer of both a male and a female contraceptive because they're both hormonal, then they might be eating away at the female cardigan market as well. So there are a lot of disincentives, which again just speaks to the need to dispel some of that and discuss this idea of dual partner contraceptive use. I think that one other thing to consider as well is how much we or the pharmaceutical company can shape culture. It's not necessarily a function of how much demand there is now, but when a product comes out, can demand be built around it? When we come back, we're going to finish by talking about the role of sexism is a playing in all of these conversations and whether we can expect to see something like this on the market in the near term. Why hello there. It's your old pal Sarah Silverman and I'm back with a brand new season of the Sarah Silverman podcast. On my podcast, I am talking about everything politics. Yeah, we get into it. I'm going to start sandwich shopping in LA. I know a few spots and I'm going to tell you about them. I'm also going to be talking to you. I will be reacting and responding to listener voicemails in real time. Let me tell you things can get weird and I love every second of it. Weird is my comfort zone. The newest season of the Sarah Silverman podcast is out now wherever you get your podcasts. Hi, I'm June Diane Raffiel and I'm Jessica St. Clair. And each week we are sitting down to talk all about life's twists, turns and absurdities on the deep dive. From exploring the depths of TikTok, which is our only news source to navigating the complexities of grief and loss, we are just two best friends behind a mic processing life together. This podcast is all about finding the silver linings in the madness. So get ready for unfiltered conversations about motherhood, careers, pop culture and everything in between. Here at the deep dive, we're all about community. We believe in the power of sharing experiences and the strength that comes from supporting one another and we would love to have you with us. So be sure to join us every Wednesday on the deep dive from Lemonade Media, wherever you get your podcasts. So I think we've been a little bit beating around the bush on this topic. So let's just put it on the table. You know, I think women would point out that they've been dealing with some of the side effects that men may find objectionable here for years. You got pharmaceutical companies, which have plenty of women and plenty of women scientists. But for a long time, and even today, the CEOs, most of the CEOs are men. And you know, you've got a physical health risk. I mean, it's it's it's remote, thankfully, in the US today. But you've got a risk and childbirth still of a very bad outcome parts of the world. And in the US, particularly in women with women of color. So there is this health risk that women want to protect themselves for. And to what extent is all of this progress blended by the fact that men just don't care enough and that there's just inherent sexism behind a lot of this? Yeah, I think to answer this question, I would go back to something you told me earlier about this cultural script about what it is to be a man to reject health care, reject what's feminine, you know, be macho, be sex driven. I think the more that we paint people or paint men in this box, the more that we prevent other narratives about men to emerge. And I think that's what we need to be focusing on now, which is this idea that men can be more than what we thought men can actually care about pregnancy and actually do care about pregnancy, preventing pregnancy, managing pregnancy, you know, all of it. You know, I think the other thing is is that we need to start reframing this risk benefit equation. And we've always thought about women to of course have all the risk of pregnancy. And then they take on the risk of contraceptive to prevent that. But there are lots of models in medicine now or emerging models in medicine where you can think about the couple as taking on the risk together. For example, in the setting of organ transplantation, a living donor gives a organ to another person. They are actually taking on a risk to prevent a health consequence than another person. So if we reframe the risk benefit calculation for the couple, a man taking on a contraceptive and having some side effects to prevent the risk in his partner actually has a lot different calculation associated with it. No, that's a good example. You know, and I like that example. We spent a lot of time on this show talking about people getting vaccinated or even wearing masks. One of the things that I think is a country and maybe more globally, but certainly as a country where you found disappointing is that people are motivated to protect their own health a lot more than they have been to wear a mask because they care about the contagion and the spread and spreading it to others. And that motivation doesn't appear strong. Now we can't paint everybody with a broad brush. In fact, we shouldn't paint anybody with a broad brush. There's a lot of people in the population that care deeply about the people in the world that they care about and they're people who are willing to do things for people that they don't know. So this notion, this model, we sort of are face to face with that kind of question all the time. And I love your idea of framing and I love Brian's concept that we have to set the right examples and set the right models if we want to turn these stereotypes over. Yeah. And I'll bring this in a little bit closer by saying that as a husband and as a father to a daughter, I'm very invested in the choices that they might make in terms of their choice of contraception. And if there's an opportunity to share some of that burden with a male partner so that they don't have to suffer, whether that be financially or even from a health standpoint in the rare case of complications, I would do it. The other comment I would make is that there were a lot of comments to the op-ed piece that we wrote regarding the real issue here is that men aren't responsible even if there is a birth and that the real key is stronger parental support laws and enforcing that men have to take financial responsibility for an unplanned pregnancy. And that is certainly important in our society and in dealing with sexism, but we have made some progress and we've made enormous progress in having broader conversations about sexuality. And so we can build on that, I think. It doesn't take that away. It doesn't mean that we have conquered the sexism of child rearing in our society because we haven't. But the more of these conversations we're having, the more opportunity there is to educate men about what they can do to be part of the solution. I think that's a really great point. And hopefully even generationally we're seeing differences. There are a lot more couples, a lot more families where the child responsibilities are increasingly shared. And yet we still sort of, to some degree, are counting on the enlightenment of men to embrace a problem that they historically haven't. Or at least in my generation, didn't do a great degree. My generation did more than the generation before, mine for sure. But I think when we see unfairnesses like we do in, or at least in my description of the Dobbs, Jackson ruling, I hope that that causes people to rethink a question. And what risks we're really asking our partners to take as men, and what we can do to share in that burden, share in that risk. I need to play off that point. I wanted to make sure that we talk about the need for properly measuring the impact of unintended pregnancy and how men benefit from preventing unintended pregnancy. We often talk about the health outcomes and the health benefits of women using contraception. But men certainly benefit when women use contraception and when women choose to abort an unintended pregnancy. We have studies that show that men's education improves, their ability to earn, also improves their work productivity also improves. So these are important outcomes that are not necessarily health outcomes, but they are economic outcomes that very much matter. So certainly incorporating that into our calculus of the benefits of everyone having a contraceptive method that works for them is super important. It's been a really rich conversation. So tell us how close we are if things continue to progress with these trials, Stephanie, to seeing FDA approval. And if we see FDA approval, we see something in the market, what will it look like? Will it be over the counter? Will it require a prescription? What are you envisioning? So the product that's furthest along in clinical development is this transdermal gel that I alluded to earlier, which men would apply every day. And when you say apply the applications to the shoulder area, is that right? Yeah, the contraceptive gel we're evaluating is very much like the consistency of hand sanitizer and men put a pump of the gel into their hands and they rub it onto their shoulders and they need to do that every day. Okay. Yeah, so that product we're currently testing it in about 450 couples across the globe. And we anticipate that that study will be concluded in the next 18 to 24 months. And so far, I can't comment too much on the results, but things look really promising. And so if that were to proceed to a final, what we call phase three study, we anticipate that that would start in the next couple of years. And that will be dependent on the FDA giving us guidance as to how many couples we will need and so forth. I would expect that will be a study of about 3000 couples. And that's where, of course, the funding issue comes in. But if we can identify a funding source and move forward with that, I think those results would be available in the next three to four years. So that's a long answer that I can consolidate into saying if things went really smoothly, we might see a product on the market in five to seven years. How long has there experienced health that it take to recruit 3000 couples for this trial? Because I think that feels like what's going to dictate, particularly if your phase two results are good, it feels like that's what's going to dictate a lot of the timing, right? Yeah, I think it will. I think we, you know, the phase three trial, the study we're doing now requires the participants to really be invested. We are checking on them on a monthly and sometimes every two week basis. And so the phase three trial will be a little less burdensome because we'll have more data to support the product. We would expect that that trial will have many more sites than the 15 that are currently participating and that we would again have sites across the globe. So it is a steep mountain to climb, but I think, you know, we would have, again, with resources, the ability to recruit much more quickly in some respects and also provide the participants a lot of reassurance. And so I'm optimistic. Well, we'll put a link in the show notes for people who are interested in these trials and want to participate. You can just go right and click on the link and that will help you figure out if you want to participate or if you know someone who does. Brian, any, any closing thoughts? Yeah. So, you know, I think that when you first started the podcast, you were referencing the Dobbs decision and, you know, what that means for women. And I'll say that one of the problems in our society that is historically and culturally we've attributed pregnancy and the care of pregnancy to women. And in doing so, we highlight the, you know, evidence of the patriarchy and ongoing misogyny that's within our judicial system because with a stake here with Dobbs is we're potentially criminalizing women's decisions about their own bodies. And if this is truly about protecting the fetus, then decisions about abortion are frequently made in partnerships with a male partner. So why are we not talking about men? And even if they're not, even if the decision is not made by the man, the man participated and it's got to have equal culpability. Right, exactly. And that's not really a conversation we're talking about because this has not really been about care of the unborn fetus, but rather it's been about, you know, punishing women. I find that to be a very disturbing evidence about the sexism in our current society. And so the way I see it developing male contraception is a step in the right direction towards right sizing that and bringing men to the conversation about our responsibility, which is a responsibility that is shared by all people, not just one single gender. There's so many contradictions in this ruling. My wife pointed out one very clear one, which is why can't women who are pregnant get a full tax deduction for the person that they're supposedly dependent on them. Yeah, exactly. So there's a lot inherent in here that if this were about caring for children, would be reflected very, very differently. Stephanie, let us give you the last word. How would you like to close out the conversation? I think that it's just really important to remember that the DAWS decision is having a disproportionate impact on women of color and women without with limited economic means. And so, contraception in the end is also about trying to ensure that those who are most affected by the limitations that our country is putting on women's reproductive health have access to making sure that all pregnancies are planned. So, you know, we feel like male contraception is something that can be added to the mix. It is not meant to replace female methods. I think that's just really important to make clear women need to have agency over their own bodies. But by adding more options for men, we hope that they will step up to the plate and be greater participants than I think they will. Well, thank you both for being here and for the work and research you're doing. Obviously, we brought not only attention to it, but particularly with the back half of our conversation, challenge everyone's thinking and how they think about these issues in ways that I think should represent what is a more fair and just a way and at a moment when I hope everybody's putting everything on the table. This is clearly one of the things that needs to be on the table. So, thank you both so much. Thanks so much for having us. It was great to talk to you guys about a topic that we are very, very passionate about. Thank you so much for taking the time and for your interest in this work. Andy, we really appreciate it. Okay, let me tell you what's coming up on the show. For those of you who have been watching the January 6 hearings, I'm really happy. Our Monday guest is Mark Liebovich. We're going to talk about with Mark, even so much what's happened with Trump on January 6, that is kind of the culmination of a series of events. We're going to talk about what happened in the years leading up to that in Washington and not really even focused just on Trump, but all the people in Washington that were ostensibly there to stop really bad things from happening and keep our government functioning who let that happen. The Lindsey Grahams, the Ted Cruz, the Marco Rubio's, the Bill Bars of the world. If you don't know, Mark, he's fantastic. As I think I mentioned, he's a writer with the Atlantic former New York Times reporter. We have some other great shows coming up, important show on COVID, where we're going to be talking about the latest that's happening. We have Tony Fauci coming back on the show. That'll be fun.
