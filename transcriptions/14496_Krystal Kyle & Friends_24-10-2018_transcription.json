    "text": " And we're back with another riveting episode of Slow Burn. Oh, wow. Oh, my God. No one would ever confuse us with that. Thank you, though. We are going into politics. Guys, Britney Spears is back and urban and urban as I heard urban inspired Vickers residency domination drops in February at the MGM, which is literally like two blocks from where she was before. It's also, by the way, her comeback, it was hard to believe in this comeback because she abandoned her own comeback, the announcement. She's like, I'm here for three minutes and I have to go to where in Vegas? No gas. Okay, did Joe watch the live stream? I did. The live stream was, so she announced that she was going to make an announcement on Ellen. And then wait, she had a live stream to announce. First, she announced. She first, she made an announcement that there was going to be an announcement. And then the live stream happened. And I guess during Ellen fans are outside of a part in the in Vegas. Her music is playing Mario Lopez is there materialized. Nobody introducing Britney. Although he introduced her and then had to introduce her again because she didn't come out. And then music played, she rose from the stage, waved at her fans and then walked to her car. This is on Ellen or the live stream. The live stream was like Ellen's YouTube channel. Ellen, she had no reason to be there other than to announce something would occur eventually. Another announcement. Yeah. Well, you know, I good for Britney. I don't I feel like that's all I have to say about her for the last five or six years. Just good for her. My feeling about her is always the same, which is shrug. I'm rooting for her. Yeah, it's it doesn't really go beyond that. I don't I don't I wish she had just called it hip hop inspired because hello, if you've been to a urban environment recently, it is overrun with white people. I no longer means what you think it means anymore. But other than that, it's going to be cold brew inspired. Right, exactly. Hympt milk benders. Sierra has figured out her lane. Like this show, the song is just like catchy. And then she just dances like a maniac has like a heart attack on stage is like that's what she should have always been doing. Right. We didn't come for the singing. No, but she's she's a better dancer than everyone. Right. She would be competing with I always say no one dances faster. Yeah. Which she just I'm like, this is you figured you packed it. Sierra, congratulations. Yeah. I'm proud of her too. I am. I hope that she just like she should go on a tour. She's dance. Sounds like a lot of work. I know. I feel like she gets up in the morning and a step up movie falls out of her. Well, if Justin Timberlake can go on tour. Okay. I saw people posting videos from his concert or he's on to a movie last night in New York. And I was a little disgusted by the people who uploaded those Instagram. I'm not going to mention any names, but I really took a hard Justin Timberlake turn. It's like, I don't I mean, he was like annoying at the Super Bowl, but I don't have the animosity. I am just gussed it. Man of the woods was a lot of its performative. Yes. I still listen to Rocky of Body. I still listen to Rocky of Body. Okay. And love sex magic with Sierra. What are we talking about? Let's go. Let's start the show. Later, there will be an interview with me and Karamo Brown from Netflix's Queer Eye. We get into it. I know we hate talking about the NFL and the white people who run it, but it's back in the news again. The Super Bowl seems like it is a year round topic at this point. But according to Rolling Stone, both Rihanna and Pink turned down offers to perform in the February halftime show. And so Maroon 5 was basically the NFL's last choice. Also, I have to say, a Rihanna half thing show would have been amazing. Also a Pink half time show would have been amazing. I feel bad, but they did the right thing. They fit all those carousels and like things she'd be hanging from. Big tops. The important part is that they turned it down in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick, which is a good thing. So, yes. The most important part of that story. No, I'm excited that they turned it down because of that. And less excited that Adam Levine was like, sure. Right. I mean, it's a funny thing because one, the Super Bowl is going to be in Atlanta this year. So everyone was like, great, you have an opportunity to actually feature the plethora of artists from Atlanta, most of whom are black. And instead they went with Maroon 5. But the other side of that is if you're a black artist, you probably don't want to perform at the Super Bowl because of how they treated Colin Kaepernick and because of how they've handled all these other issues. So it's sort of a little bit of a cast designing women that's right. White Atlanta people. And also, Cardi B said that she is not interested in performing in the Super Bowl either. And people as the cause of Colin, we should guess, assume that all these people are because of Colin Kaepernick. No, we should not. We should not necessarily assume that it's important. It's just, well, the non-white people. Okay. I don't think ludicrous is turning it down just because, you know, he has a bar mitz for that day. You think he's being offered it? I doubt it. Yeah. But Cardi B turned it down because of the Colin Kaepernick thing. And, you know, a lot of people rumored that she would have been performing with Maroon 5 because they're single girl like you has been number one for 13 fucking weeks. It is disturbing. I mean, I say this part of her. It is the chain-smoker song. It's the biggest hit of the decade. What? By the way, Maroon 5 has a number of singles like that where it's just the number one forever, hundreds of millions of views. And there's just no reason why it just is other than people like them. Well, that'll be the halftime. Is she the only one in that video or are there other? No, I actually have seen the video. There's a bunch of women in it. Is it the white version of Drake's Nice For What? No, because it's, well, one, there were white women and nice for what? For starters. And then also just a living a month. No, and um, it wasn't Emma Roberts or the Hermione, one of those girls doing spells. Yeah, one of the two of them. But it's like it's a wider swath of ladies in the girls. Like you they're not necessarily going to recognize everyone in it versus like a nice for what you will accept. You didn't recognize Hermione. Is that who's in it? Emma Watson. Or is it Emma Roberts? That's he's bizarre. One of them. One of them. Emma Thompson? Emma Bunton? Emma Lazarus who wrote the book on the Statue of Liberty? Emma P. Oh, my favorite. I love a cat. This is all to say that a lot of musicians don't want to be up in the Super Bowl halftime show, but not just musicians, comedian and actress and podcast rival. Podcast rival. That's right. No, you you her. She's Sally area. Your Mozart. Our rival is the daily. That's right. Okay. And Oprah, not Amy Schumer. All right. But Amy Schumer took the Instagram to declare that she will not appear in any Super Bowl ads next year. And she called for Maroon five to drop out of the halftime show as well. I didn't see that part. She uh, she wrote. I wonder why more white players aren't kneeling. Once you witness the truly deep inequality and endless racism people of color face in our country, not to mention the police brutality and murders. Why not Neil next year brothers? Otherwise, how are you not complicit? I think it would be good if Maroon five backed out of the Super Bowl like Rihanna did. I personally told my reps I wouldn't do any Super Bowl commercials this year. I know it must sound like a privilege as sacrifice, but it's all I got. Hidden NFL with the advertisers is the only way to really hurt them. First of all, that's not all you got. You could donate a lot of money to call on cabinets organization or to the many organizations that are fine trying to fight police brutality. Girl. Do I think it's awesome that she said brothers or brothers and sisters 50 times like she's Marvin Gaye? Yes. She said, stand up for your brothers and sisters of color. And my hottest thing a guy can do is get down on one knee, not to propose, but to reject the treatment of his teammates by this country. That is the weirdest way to. You know what? I could tell that she wrote this to herself. She shouldn't because again, a good example of you should have stopped early. Right. If she had stopped after, I'm not taking any money would have been like, okay, but then she had to keep going and you're just like, get down on one knee. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think Maroon five should drop out of the Super Bowl would have been sufficient, you know, and she telling us that color catheter was turning her on by getting off with me. Imagine being like, I mean, it's just not what's on my mind when this is occurring. Daddy, me and again, police brutality. The other thing is she when it came out, I was like, you know what? Good for her, but it did feel like she was trying to step on Rihanna's moment because Rihanna and Pink were getting the majority of the press for not performing. And she was like, me too. I'm not doing it either, which sure, but I just, I care less that you're not doing this than Rihanna and Pink. It is. She's like the only prominent voice I've heard though, be like in Maroon five, why are you doing this? Because it's weirdly a band where you don't expect them to have any political ideas or whatever. You know, I think we're a solo artist who would have been a little bit more conspicuous. But anyway, Maroon actually seven or whatever it is. Maroon, a bunch of white guys and one very accomplished black performance. Yes, a Grammy nominee, maybe winner on his own. Yeah, it's weird because if Rihanna had done the show, people would have been like, girl, what are you doing? But she would have never done the show as we found out. But with Maroon five is sort of just, okay, like no one's really upset. Well, you know, it's not that much for me. No one's really thinking of that. Yeah, no one expects much from them. They have inexplicable hits that I love. Except for girl, like, I don't like this song. I know it does. But moves like Jagger, unfortunately, decided to go full throttle against Maroon five. And it's also no shade. No shade. She appeared alongside Seth Rogen in a 2016 but like commercial. Are we sure she was going to be in a commercial work here? She wasn't it would last year. She hasn't just unless she has something coming out. This is like, I'm turning down this offer that has not been made to me yet because people are not yet making their Super Bowl commercials yet. I also will not be appearing in a Super Bowl commercial and I'm sure there I mean, maybe it's a nice preemptive strike for next year when Super Bowl commercial starts to roll around. People are going to be like, oh, I'm also not doing one. Right. But that's the other thing we're like the big deal about it being like Rihanna is, Rihanna very conceivably could have been a Super Bowl performer. If who's I don't want to be me if guys, girl, if we had said I'm not performing at the Super Bowl, the impact would not have been as strong because you know, no one's asking her to do it. And similarly with pink where you were like, oh, you're both very famous people who probably could have had this gig. You pick the person you could be gently mean us to. The number one. Rita Ora is a choice though because with her Black magic, she could miraculously end up at the Super Bowl. Right. People would be like, why are you here? But she's there performing a halftime show. Guys, you heard it here first. Keep it. It's not doing a live show of the Super Bowl halftime show. We're turning it down. We're turning it down. It would have been really cute. I mean, I love people screaming when you know, when you said Catherine don't know, and they just go like crazy. So much fun. How do we feel about Amy now? I mean, I don't know. She's, I commend the effort. Yeah, I guess. She used to be very messy. And it seems like she's still messy, but she's trying to not be messy. I mean, I think the real props here go to Rihanna and pink. Yes. Amy, sure. Better, better than the alternative. This room for everybody under Pink's big top. It's a well, oh, how very this is me. I will always think inside Amy Schumer was excellent. Her stand up. I have enjoyed some of the time. And I agree, she's less messy now than she was before the Instagram post could have been a little shorter. That's where I stand on her. Every Instagram post could be shorter. Right. Just rule of thumb. If you're if you're getting into what could be a graph, it's too long. She was like, she's like those hot guys on Instagram, who instead of just posting their photo of their abs and going, they decide to post like three paragraphs about something. Yeah, like, or like fortune cookie wisdom. Yes. Like, you know, I was in this industry trying to blah, blah, blah. And I'm like, did I need this? You don't need to post all the lyrics to fast car on your like, on your thirst picture, all your hard times. Anyway, it's nice that people were turning it down. I know that last year, there was a little bit of criticism against Lady Gaga for performing, but I feel like this year, if anyone, oh, that was two years ago, Justin Timberlake was this area. Wow. That's right. Well, he did it last year and we were like, of course he did. Also, don't watch the Super Bowl anyway, guys. How about that? Right. Leave it at that. Nobody watched the Super Bowl. Then no, you won't have to watch room five. You're too easy. Send a message to the NFL. Don't watch the Super Bowl and a story. Yeah, I concur there. It's super easy for me not to watch football. And I'm really happy with myself about it. All right. You heard it here first. We are not going to talk about the Super Bubble Bex year. Congrats to next year's players. Three doors down or whoever's going to fucking take a and I'm less something interesting happens that we have to talk about it. Anyway, we'll be back talking about Lewis C K. I sort of thought that we were done hearing about Lewis C K, you know, when he wasn't busy creeping into comedy rooms to do unexpected sex popping up and sellers. But on Monday morning on Howard Stern, Sirius X and radio show. Yes, that's a bad catalog. I don't know if you want to investigate. Like talk about things that will be problematic now. I feel like every awful thing that we find out about Trump, it's like, oh, he said this on a Howard Stern interview 10 years ago during like a five hour interview. Yeah, well, if you were on Howard Stern, I'm just going to say find that episode and get it deleted from me. There's no way you said something good or helpful. But Sarah Silverman was on it and girl, she jumped out the window, which she said some comments about Lewis C K and his masturbating in front of people without their consent. She said that he's done it to her before only plot twist. It was with her consent. She said, I don't know if I'm going to write saying this. I've known Lewis forever. I'm not making excuses for him. So please don't take it that way. But we are peers. We are equals. When we were kids and he asked if he could masturbate in front of me. Sometimes I'd go, fuck yeah, I want to see that. It's not analogous to the other women that are there talking about what he did to them. He could offer me nothing. We were only just friends. So sometimes, yeah, I wanted to see it. It was amazing. Sometimes I would say, fucking no gross. And we got pizza. I'm not saying everyone should embrace Lewis again. I believe he has remorse. I just want him to talk about it on stage. It's going to have to find his way or not find his way. I like that and the sentiment. However, it's she said it herself. It's with this headline and story blew up because it's not analogous in any way to the other stories. Like this is not, I don't care what he did consensually with his good friend like 25 years ago. Which comedian she tweeted at Sarah saying exactly that. Yeah. Yeah. Louis C.K. accused of Rebecca Corey said to be clear, C.K. had nothing to offer me as I too was his equal on the set the day he decided to sexually harass me. He took away a day I worked years for and still has no remorse. He's a predator who victimized women for decades and lied about it. And Silverman apologized after that saying she mostly regret it that she weighed in on the topic at all. Right. I mean, historically, I think Sarah Silverman has been just among the Rad or comics period. I just think she's somebody who's like, you know what I've said? Dumb fucking things. I'll list them in order. Blackface. Yeah. I mean, Brad to some. Yeah. I'm sure Megan Kelly loves Sarah. Oh god. We've seen that if MLK were alive, he would have voted for Bernie Sandin saying all kinds of dumb shit, frankly. She blocked me last election because for that. And then also when she tweeted last year that her in 2016, you should go vote. It's your civil disobedience. You don't know what you're talking about. So stop talking about shit. You know, nothing about. That doesn't make any fucking sense. You're saying voting is not civil disobedience. Go read the row, read a book. Again, everyone problem solved by reading books. Sitters in the hand of an angry god. Am I right? It's only civil. Just like, let's get into the definitions of words here. Yeah. She, you know, the thing that's frustrating because she is right. Like the and I think who was a Jen Kirkman pointed out that we often are asking women to weigh in on these terrible men. And it's shitty because like he's make, Louis, he is like making Sarah Silverman look stupid, like from afar, because she is going to be asked about him because she is publicly friends with him. And like that friendship, that's the thing these dudes, it's like a betrayal to these people that you care about. And you make the women in your life look dumb for one standing by you. And then, and then in his case in particular, not having any remorse because if he, at least public remorse, because if he had, she could at least sit down when she's asked about him and say, look at this thing. He said, look at what he's done. He's trying to be better. She doesn't even have anything to point to. So when she sits down to talk about him, it's just purely from, well, he didn't do it to me, basically, which is not helpful to anyone. Right. And no one's asking Aziz about this, because he's still repped by Dave Becky, who was Louis CK's manager. We're not asking other prominent men in the comedy scene, like, what's going on with Louis CK? Well, technically, we asked Jimmy Kimmel, and that turned into a mess. But it is weird that people keep being like, women, what do you think about someone masturbating in front of you? I think about this in like, even cases that aren't journalistic, like recently on Watch What Happens Live, Lena Dunham was a guest. And I don't okay. So Andy Cohen does this bit. I'm already interested. Yes, called Plead the Fifth, where he basically asks somewhat, not intrusive questions, but difficult questions and basically challenges the guests to answer them. Well, he asked Lena Dunham a question that is like provocative enough. He said, who's the most misogynist celebrity? And she sat there and thought about it. And she goes, Daniel Tash. Now, here's the thing. That answer is qualified, but he would never ask that to a male guest. You would because you know, they would not have like a good enough answer. Whereas, someone like Lena Dunham has been, you know, kind of forced to think about that talks about that publicly and stuff. And it's just, even though it's a good question for her to answer, it's not something that everybody would have to answer, you know, it's like when Andy asked Nicki Minaj, how many penises she'd seen and didn't ask Taylor Swift that question either. And Nicki said, why are you asking me? I have had a man for like a decade. She's had one boyfriend and you roll up and he's like, how many am I saying Nicki? Also, sister, also to question a lot of your judgment. If you think any aspect of Lewis C K masturbating was amazing. Amazing is a pretty specific word to apply to that situation. That's that. Well, also, by the way, Sarah Silverman sister Sarah Silverman sister talked about how he like masturbated in front of her 20 times. So which anyway, these are all these like sound bites are getting conflated and like put juxtaposed against these other women's stories, which are horrifying. We're talking about criminal ish behavior, which again is strange because Laura Silverman said it wasn't criminal, though it was disgusting. It's like, no, it is criminal, which is asking period is weird. So even just going back to whether or not you said yes, even asking deserves a long discussion about why he felt the need to even ask that. Well, it's weird because I had always assumed that this was some weird, like dynamic that started happening when he was, you know, with other comedians. Yeah, he was famous. Yeah. This nigga been masturbating since he was just like a kid running around the neighborhood, his parents, I never walk in on him doing this to somebody and be like, stop. Yeah, it does seem like there's a larger psychological issue there. For a just the jump. Yeah. Thank you, little Kim's La Balamafia. Also, women, you don't have to answer questions when these people I think that's the takeaway. And I think like you can just say like, I think that the best so far has been Robin Wright, where she's sort of just like, I don't know him. I hope he figures it out. And then she killed Kevin and then she killed Kevin. And then she killed Kevin. But you don't actually, and I think that there is something to like, if you're at an inner, you're sitting at an interview and you are asked that question, and you do recognize it to be sort of a double standard, just say it right then. Be like, when it who is Howard, who is the last male comedian, you asked that question too. And and leave it at that because that because then you're challenging these idiots to fucking be better at all. And you're pointing out the fact that there is a double standard in that it isn't fair that you're asked these questions. I wonder if he's masturbated in front of some men. I do not want that. I need to just get away from that. Do they just do they just kick back, you know, put on space balls and just with it out? You're saying there might be more people who know about this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A little circle jerk situation. Well, we don't know because they don't ask any of the dudes. I want to uncover this. I want to get to the bottom of it. Okay. All right. Thank you. I am. I am Jeff. I'm the star. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Star reporter. Law and law and order was jacking off. When we're back, Elle magazine, what are you doing? I'm going to get a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit. The midterms are less than two weeks away. And everyone is pulling out all the stops to get people registered to get to the polls. John Lovett is popping out of people's fridges. Still dressed like Favreau. I'm sure is, you know, yelling at people from his car. We are all devoted to getting people to vote. However, Elle magazine, maybe should have stopped with their attempt on Twitter last week. They ran a fake story with the headline. Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are splitting up. And the link to it was just a page encouraging people to register to vote. A lot of people were not happy with that. Because first, it was dumb. It was dumb. It was a real dumb. Elle, you are kind of a news organization. You can't just make things up and then say, well, it was for a good cause. No, the good cause you do is journalism. So making up news is a bad thing. Yeah, it is weird to not put any, a warning or any sort of clue that this is that this is satire. Yeah, at all. Like really trying to pass it off as like one of their stories is bizarre. Also, I think I saw people that were like, you know, they clicked on it and they weren't registered to vote and they registered. So it is one of those things where you're like, I guess if it got some people to vote. But I wonder how many people clicked on that were like fuck you Elle. Now it was a little bit difficult to vote. But I wonder how many people clicked on that. Now I'm like, now I'm not going to vote or like, now I'm not going to, I'm not going to read any more coverage of the ship because I'm only going to vote because Elle magazine tricked me with a fake story on gay and Kim. Also, they stole that fucking tweet. Oh no, that was all over Twitter before that. Yeah, the first person who did that was trans activist Ashley Marie Preston. She just had this random tweet that was like, Oh, you're not going to hear about like something about it. Something about like Kim and Kanye splitting up or something and it was a link to that. And she is not a journalistic organization. Yeah, she was just doing a joke. Right. And then it became sort of a meme that people started doing on Twitter. Oh, and then we just cast it off as. Oh, and then Elle did one themselves stealing the original one from Ashley. That's stupid. So it wasn't even an original thing that they did. No, it was clearly something they saw. Other people do and get a lot of positive feedback for us. So they thought it was benign enough to do. Yes. I think also and like if you're a comedian, if you're a performer and you're doing something like this and whatever and you're entertaining, but like, especially if you're a publication like voting, you should, you shouldn't be tricking people in the voting. People should be voting because it's important to do because they're American citizens who care about their country, like making it the thing where it's like, Oh, you see, you cared about Kim, but now you're going to vote is just like not the way to move forward really and is not the way our democracy should be functioning. Like you should just be honest with people. You should vote because it's important not because you clicked on a link that ended up somewhere else. And as you said, like there are probably people who clicked on it and then like, I don't know, registered and then now want to save us all. Okay, fine. There's still something to me about the angle of like, Oh, juicy news about pop culture tricked you dumbass. Now you're on a voting page. It's like, this is like shaming people who are kind of into pop culture and it's just guys were we already like, I think enough people feel shame for like being into celebrities and I don't think there's anything wrong about being into celebrities. So it's just not a cute angle to me. Also, if you're L magazine, you should know something about the intersection of pop culture, apology L. Yes. It is that assumption though that yeah, that people who were into celebrity gossip and news aren't voting when I have heard that there are, for example, Pods, they have America listeners who don't vote. So really, everyone needs to be looking at themselves and your hobbies and what you're interested in and what you turned you for entertainment is not a judgment call on how smart you are or how engaged you are with. Politics. And I think I've never encountered a person, IRL, who's like, I can engage with about pop culture, who specifically like, I'm not going to vote. But I do meet people who should be very smart, who have like, asked the nine reasons why they don't want to vote in the election. Anyway, I was also annoyed because this turned into a hot news story for conservative outlets that were like L magazine is spreading fake news. Well, they kind of are. Well, and then they like, they I got written up for dragging it in the Washington Examiner. They always get it right. They were like, Ira Madison the third and Roxanne Gay decrying magazines like L and Teen Vogue, which are killing women's media. So this is what you did. L. Wow. Look what you made me do be be touted by the Washington Examiner. And like the Daily Caller tweeted that it was Doug and Kanye responded to them with like either them or Breitbart with, I agree. It's just that thing though, where generally news organizations and and all publications like need to take a better look that right now shit is crazy. Like we things are crazy and you are contributing to to all of these conversations and you're just contributing and your sources of information. And so taking a second and being like, how are we helping? How are we hurting? What are we going to do about this shit? There's, you know, are we going to run a story about Ivanka that is not like a glowing fucking slobber fest because she's being covered that way. Other places like just because we're a women's magazine or whatever we're fashion magazine doesn't mean that we can't participate in this climate in a useful way. So it's just like there was also just no fucking thought that went into it, which is also it was a self congratulatory joke done for retweets. And that's for the rest of Twitter. Don't do that magazines. Just tell me what a vote. Yeah, that seems to work fine too. November 6. So make sure you and your friends are registered and visit votesaveamerica.com for all the resources and information that you actually need. Vote Safe America's got your back. Check it out. Up next an interview with Queer Eyes, Karomo Brown. And we're back. I'm sitting here with Karomo Brown from Netflix's Queer Eye. He is their resident culture expert and we're going to get into a conversation about politics is passed on the real world and more. Karomo. Hey, you are the culture expert on Queer Eye. So what's popping in the culture right now? Like what's a thing that you would imbue on most people? See, my title culture is very misleading. Okay. I'm actually the mental health expert on the show that fixes the hearts of minds. But, okay, yeah, that's a long title. It is, yeah. We came up a little bit earlier in our little mini group session. I would be the heart expert. Okay. Yeah. You're going to change that. They're not. But if you petition it maybe, you know. Yeah. But yeah, I mean, like in the culture right now, what do people need to focus on? Let's focus on like figuring out how to get Kanye West back on his meds. That'd be good. I love that. I don't know who that is. Don't know who you are. You are a cancel culture. Don't know who you're talking about. You can't be quite a cancel culture. I do not subscribe to cancel culture. You do not. I do not. The whole. Because what happened? The whole meaning of keep it is cancel. I mean, what happens if someone cancels you? I've almost been canceled before by the right. Oh, yeah. Okay. I probably deserved it. If someone canceled me, I would. I just go to Europe and chill. Yeah, just hang out. I find cancel me. Please. No, I don't want that to happen. Okay. Heart expert. Yeah. Heart expert. You want to reach out to Kanye then. You want you want someone to reach out to Kanye. Yeah. I want I want his physician to encourage him to get back on his medication, which he has openly admitted that he is off. And I want him to find support through therapy consistently because I don't think he's ever dealt with the trauma or of paying for the surgery that ultimately ended his mother's life. And I think that that plays into stardom and everything else. And I'm not trying to diagnose. I don't know the man, but I think there we should be rallying around him instead of canceling him. Okay. All right. It just, it literally is the same reason why I ended up in the White House earlier this year because I'm like, I can't cancel Trump and Pence. I might not have voted for them, but I must go in there and try to advocate and try to change some hearts and minds in hopes that things can change. I see. I was going to talk about that later. We get into it. Jump into it. Jump into it. So you don't want to cancel Pence. Miss Pence, who's out here campaigning with Mark Harris, who thinks that homosexuality should still be illegal. Mm. Mm. Mm. She is out there stealing Harriet Samson Harris's haircut and putting evil on it. But you don't want to cancel her. Shady! You're so shady. You're so shady. I want to educate her. I don't want to cancel her. I want to educate her and open her mind and open her heart up. I truly believe that's where it goes. Because the thing is, if we say cancel, she's just going to find a group of people who also feel canceled or rejected and say, let's band together and vote someone else in office who also believes this not sends. Well, that's how the X-Men were formed. Completely. Yeah. That's how the X-Men's were formed. Seriously. Yeah. And I'm not defending Karen Pence or Mike Pence or the Trump's at all. But what I do think is important is us, instead of focusing on that one fact, of saying there had to be other external issues that were going on. And now that we've seen what has happened there, how can we make sure that we don't repeat that behavior? How can I work with other people who have different views than me so that they can encourage their elected officials to say this is not okay behavior? So if we were in a position where the Reagan's were in office, we have Trump's in office and Pence's in office that are even worse, I reach out to the Republicans. And they reach out to those Republicans and say, this is what's happening. So the next time you vote, I need you to understand how that vote is affecting me and affecting my family and affecting our country. And hopefully you'll make a decision in that booth to vote for someone who's going to support us all. But sometimes you got to throw a brick at Stonewall. You do. You do. Truth be told. Truth be told. I like throwing bricks. Truth be told. You like them and shade. Clearly. It's shade and brick. Just like we have people on both ends of the spectrum, I think you need both you and I. I mean, this is a conversation that my castmate and I have, Jonathan Van Ness have all the time. Jonathan is very vocal. He's very vocal, but he's vocal on the opposite end. He's like, cancel all of them. He does not have time for Kanye. He doesn't want to talk to any of them. He doesn't want to speak to them. And I'm like, where does that get us? Now you're here and I'm here and none of us are talking. Have you ever lived in a household where someone is not talking to you? Well, my father didn't talk to me because he abandoned me. How did that make you feel? Okay. It's going to happen. So no, I get it when people aren't communicating. And how does that make you how does that feel? It's the worst. Yes, but you at least these are still people who are your family. You love them. You know, it's not someone who would. But hear me out with this. The little match girl. Hear me out with this. Though I did not vote for President Trump, I do need him succeed at this point. And I need us to succeed. By him in 2020. Hold on. Here we go. Hold on. Hear me out. I do believe that we have to vote him out in 2020. And I do believe the elections coming up on November 6 are very important that people need to get out and vote. But until the day that we are in a space that we're going to be voting Trump out of office, right now I need him to succeed. He is still the president of our country. And I do not agree with majority of what he does. And I don't believe that he stands for my values and doesn't mimic my attitude and my ideals. But I do believe that if we can use get enough people to influence him that there could be a way that he could succeed for all of us. Because until he's out of office, he's still making decisions on your behalf. So we can fight against him all we want to pretend like he's not in office. He's not my president. But then the day he is. And so do we want to make him work and work for us? Or do we want to pretend he's not there and let him keep making foolish decisions? I will say anybody, anybody, anybody, am I just that? It's like, come on. This is certainly a kumbai-ish feeling. It's not really that kumbai-ish. It's really realistic. I do want to ask though what happens if he fails? I feel like he's already failed. Thank you. So what is happening? You feel it. We're watching children be in cages. We're watching all of these direct effects of him failing. And so as a country, instead of saying, look, he failed and look, we knew this was going to happen. Oh my gosh, he's horrible. How do we get to a space where we work together so that he can succeed and succeed for all of us? And I think it starts with influencing those who we think are different than us. I was at a governor's debate in Illinois recently in Quincy, Illinois. And it was 95% Republican in there. And the majority of them were between the ages of 55 and 75 and white. And here I am, 37-year-old black gay guy. You jaw-play big girl? We did not. We did not. I actually watched them boo majority of that debate. I mean, boo every time education was brought up, boo every time healthcare was brought up, boo every time something that I value was brought up. They don't care about healthcare. They're about to die. So here we go. So the person I was with said the same thing you said. They don't care about it. So why do I need to talk to them? And I spent the hour after the debate walking around to each of those people and helping them to understand why it's important that they care. Putting a human face on these issues that politicians are just throwing out to make us feel like we have to either be left or right. So voters, yes. I agree talking to people who can vote. Yes. Trump, Pence, Fargot. Voters, voters are the ones who want to endure that is how you influence the senators and the elections. And we got again there. And even my interaction with Karen Pence's chief of staff was for me to go in there and say she has an ear to Karen. Karen has an ear to Mike. Do I believe one conversation is going to change things dramatically? But maybe I could seep into your subconscious so the next time you make a decision. Freddie Krueger? Yeah. Freddie Krueger was a bad bitch, baby. Listen. Okay. If I could be Freddie Krueger, I would do it. Yeah. Thank you. Trump wouldn't be an office then. Because you would have his dream. More than that, but let's not get to that. I want to talk. You seem less militant now than your early reality show days. Because I have always wanted to talk to you about the fact that you were so mad on the real world about Shavonda making out with a white man. See, if so misconception, I'm so glad. And now you have a white fiance. I do have a white fiance. But let's be clear. I wasn't mad at Shavonda dating a white man. Okay. I was upset that Shavonda had a boyfriend who she was prancing around and was sleeping with another man. So my morality and my issue was if you want to break up with him, give the man a chance to go about his business, but don't cheat on him. But see, the thing was, is that beauty. You did also say that she wasn't as connected to black culture as you were. Which she wasn't. Okay. And that wasn't a dance. Knock on her for dating a white man. Yeah, it wasn't knock on her. But the way that we started associating those things is, oh, you said she's not connected to black culture. And then you're upset because she's sleeping with a white guy. No, I'm saying you're not connected to black culture. And let me try to expose you. And I'm also saying, stop cheating. Go ahead and let him go. And then like sleep with the man you want to sleep with. And that was a misconception. Okay. And so the thing was, and the reason it was a misconception, which is why you see the man you stand in front of me, is because I didn't know how to articulate myself. And I also was an empathetic listener. So everything was coming out with anger, anger, anger, anger. So now I'm at a space where I don't need to communicate through anger. I can communicate through love and understanding. And then my thoughts come out more clear. And people now are like, oh, so you really wasn't that angry back then. You just didn't know how to articulate yourself. That's all there was. See? Okay. Gotcha. Other topic. I love it. Other time. Keep going. On the red carpet in February. Yes. Your t-shirt. Yes. With nigger, nigger, crossed out. Neither. Neither there. Yes. Yes. Yes. So what's up with that neither? So. I personally, listen, we use nigger on this show freely. Kara and I do. I don't, I didn't grow up, you know, with that being a word that, you know, I don't use, you know, and I understand, you know, that some black people don't feel comfortable with it. But I also feel like a statement like that is a bit sliding in the respectability politics for me. But I just always wanted to ask you about that. Sure. And me are going to be friends for the rest of my life. So, no, I'm being real. So I wore that shirt. First of all, I don't subscribe to that word. And the reason I don't subscribe to that word is because I spend a lot of time with people who are older generations at me. And so I understand the pain that that word used. There was a time that I casually threw that word around, especially when I was in high school. I would say even my friend from New College, I'm from Houston, Texas, and then my parents got divorced. I moved to Parkland, Florida, where the shooting just happened. And I'm from Milwaukee. My family uses that word. My mom does. My grandmother does. So hear me out. I've never had a problem with older people in the black community. This is, it's different. So, and this is one of the things with that word. But so the, those people who are older that I've interacted with, that word causes deep pain. And though I grew up in hip-hop culture where that word was thrown around very easily, as I started to really learn what that word was, and then I started to see people outside of our race, outside of the African American race start to use that word, it did start to bother me. Now the reason, I've had that shirt before. That's a their problem, though. That's a their problem? That's a white people problem, though. I mean, what I don't- That is a me problem. I don't feel like- I feel like black people being able to use the word and white people wanting to use the word are two different issues. That's just white people wanting to do whatever they want to do. Like they have since Columbus slinked over here. I disagree with you 100%. Okay. I disagree with you. And if someone was to call me the F word as a gay man, it would upset me. And so when I also hear straight people say that, calling each other that as something that they think is fun or using gay as a derogatory term, that's me and my culture making it seem as if this was acceptable behavior. You teach people how to treat you. That is one thing we do know to be true. And so when I see white Americans who use that word nonchalantly, who are not using the malicious way, and that's also thing. We can't pick and choose when like this person can use it and then this person we want to get upset. I think we can. This part's a white privilege that I can never use. This part's a white culture that I can't use. This part's a Jewish culture I don't use. You're going to privilege versus a word. I don't think that using a derogatory term gives us privilege. Now I'll get back to that. I don't think it gives me privilege, but I think I have the privilege to use it. But that's the same thing. You're saying that it gave you some privilege. And I don't think that I think that you're free to use anything you want to use, but you also should understand that there's repercussions and there's people that that works so does hurt. Now, the reason I wore that shirt then, because I've had that shirt for a very long time, was because I was. It was vintage. Vintage shirt. It was vintage. Vintage, honey. That event was the premiere of Unsolved. Biggie of Tupac. And I thought that it was very clear within all African American audience, which that was what was in attendance, almost 99% was African American. And also with the fact that these two artists were sort of the catalyst in a sense of making that word popular and making it part of pop culture. It was used by Biggie, it was used by the whole bad boy camp, it was used by Death Row, it was used by Tupac. And so I thought, what better way to express the fact- Lorraine Hansberry, August Wilson, Susan Lori Parks, is used by playwrights on Broadway. I'm not saying it's not, I'm not saying it's not, but I'm also saying, see what you're trying to do is you're trying to take away the fact of how I feel. No, I know you feel that way. My feeling for that and the reason I wore that shirt is to say, I actually don't believe or subscribe in this shirt. And so I am neither this nor that. So please understand that as we're going through this event, don't think that as you greet me, that those are appropriate way to greet me. And I will be very clear, and you know this, there are certain settings, especially in where it's fully African American, where we feel very comfortable with each other, and someone will walk up to you and say, what's up my N word? Megan, yeah, I'll say it to people. Yeah, and I don't like that greeting for me. Okay. I'd prefer someone to do it. So then I wouldn't greet you with that. And so that shirt was clearly letting them know my feelings on that. But somehow because we're looking for, we're looking for somehow respectability, positive, looking for all this, that it somehow doesn't become just my statement of saying, this is who I am and what I'm comfortable with. It wasn't that I brought shirts for everyone else to wear. I wore the shirt for myself and just said, this is why. Okay. I'm perfectly fine with people who don't want to use that word. Yeah. I'm perfectly fine with people. And then why do you have an issue with me wearing the shirt? I had an issue with you wearing the shirt because it was on a red carpet. It was in Getty Images. It got put online and that then subscribes of you sending a message out that you don't like the word. And I get that that was personally just for you. But also just know that when it becomes a public image, as a public figure, you wearing that shirt means that that's what you ascribe to. And that's how people will take it. So did you do it? I mean, I think he wears a MAGA hat. Yeah. We know that for him, that means make America great again. I love Trump. And obviously he would probably want to proselyze that to other people you wearing that shirt to me and other people we took it as this is your opinion. And you also, you know, wish that us other black folks would stop using that word. Yeah. And what's wrong with that? And not just for you. I love using it in general. But I love that word. I found the word beautiful. I found it powerful. I read it in playwrights who have won Pulitzer's who have won McArthur Genius grants who have won Oscars. I use it in my home. What do you have felt? Would you have felt okay, President Barack Obama would have said that during a speech? He did. You show me that speech. Barack Obama has said the word nigga. Show me the receipts. He said it's in his book. Show me the receipts. It's in my book as well. Just because I've written the word is not something that I'm using to greet or to define someone else. So if you. But Barack didn't have a problem with that word. He's he you've heard Barack Obama say that it's in his book and he said I don't have a problem with people calling me those words. All right. Because now you're now again. Let me call up Barack Obama right now. Let me get John Favreau in here to call Barack Obama. Very quick. Very quick. I will verify that and I will get back to you. Okay. But I do not think that Barack Obama who's written that book multiple times written that word multiple times in his book is from the south side of Chicago has a problem with by people using that word amongst them. Obviously he's not galling you know other politicians that word. But you like to pick and choose. I don't use it. You know but if you love the word people are so empowered by it want you to use it all the time because somewhere in your subconscious you know that is not right. Somewhere in your subconscious you don't use every word all the time. But you use it as a greeting. So why don't you greet everyone the same. So I greet everyone the same. Hey friends. How you doing? I never said I use it as a greeting. Well how else are you using it? I use it when we were talking as an adjective a verb. What do you we were talking about? Alec Baldwin on the podcast the other day saying that black people love him and I was like this isn't a matter black person that loves him. Okay. So instead of using his formal name you're using it as a noun to describe this person. Yeah he's wild. See now you're also adding a lot of definitions of this word. There are so many definitions just like there are many definitions you know it's like that Bernie Mac sketch where he said that bitch can mean a bunch of whole over different things. I think what the beauty of it might have been fucked. It might have been Monique who said bitch. Either way I will tell you this though and what I do appreciate about you is who you are your confidence and your ability to be yourself authentically and I respect that 100%. I would never ever judge you as a black man for being who you are and living your truth and I think that's the clear lesson of this is that especially in communities of colors or communities where people feel marginalized that somehow we feel like we all have to be on the same page and it's okay if we're not. It's okay if I have my viewpoint it's okay if you have your viewpoint because at the end of the day when I walk in this world I feel attacked. You feel attacked and we are still fighting the same battles and at the end of the day no matter what you actually refer to me as we're by fighting that battle I'm still have your back and you're gonna have minds and I think that's key. I agree. And that's all I'm saying about that. Well thank you Monique for coming on. No no I don't want to have my name. I want more with you. No. No. By the way you talking about all this white stuff you got a lot of white people on your phone right there. Who is that? It's the cast of Dynasty. Just saying. That is Diane Carroll right there. Her line of this caveat is burnt or the champagne is burnt. It's burnt. It's burnt. I love that. The champagne was obviously frozen in the bottle at some point. We're back. Keep it. We're here at our favorite segment of the episode. As usual it's keep it. I just want to say you never asked me what my favorite segment is. You just assume my favorite segment is keep it. Well what's your favorite segment this week? Oh okay that's it's keep up. Alright. You were right. What is your keep it? Mine is petty. Get ready. Two different Facebook comments I always see still and have for years. One is by straight people commenting on gay people's Facebook walls when they make a gay Facebook status. They say wait you're gay. Okay I already know you interpret half the fucking things I say is just gay noise. So your stupid joke like I didn't know you were gay you never brought it up before is dumb. And by the way it is all over the place. Every gay person on Facebook on Instagram gets comments from people being like wait I didn't know you're gay and that's like their big funny Johnny Carson joke yes sarcasm. Oh yeah and it's just that's it's not funny yes get over it yes don't comment on it. My other thing is when gay people who shall we say let's say they don't know who this is the name that came to mind tenach is they then comment revoke my gay card. Here's the thing gay people. That is a joke from I'm going to guess season one of Will and Grace. You need to update that reference. Okay number one. Two you are not rad because you don't know something about pop culture. You're pretending to be self-deprecating but what it really is is you're saying I don't know that frivolous information that other gay people seem to care about I'm above the fray and it's not cool stop congratulating yourself and pretending it's a joke I need to hear. It's an old joke. Sean Hayes is very talented though. Okay. Thank you. I was throwing the first brick at Stonewall. Throwing the first gay card at Stonewall. Kara what is your keep it. My keep it is to the people who decided that they would build a replica of the Titanic fill it with almost the same number of people and then sail it down the same route the Titanic took and really I think that's normal. Why why why why why just why I don't understand. I don't understand why would you do this it's not funny. Frankly it feels super kind of fucking rude to see many people who died on the Titanic. Why you have to do the same number of people the same route. I mean I don't know I guess you could just call it the Titanic if and even that doesn't seem necessary I just don't understand why I don't understand what what the point of this is what anyone is going to get out of this why anyone would want to do this how we're going to end this like great it made it to the place unlike those hundreds of other people who died. It's sponsored by Ryan Murphy. It just sounds like a season of American Horror Story. People are like enamored of the glamour of Titanic which is very strange. Also for a bunch of people on the Titanic wasn't glamorous they were down in like the underbelly yeah drowning like it also just it like it really exemplifies like class issues it just is it's just weird it's just super fucking weird. You're not Jack and Rose bitch right and who is going on this and it also if something happens to your ship. What if you die on the second Titanic. Okay that's how dumb do you look. Honestly all the clues were there. They did point out that they have the correct number of flights and wipes. Oh my god. It's just so rude to the people that like fuck you guys we've got enough boats for everyone this time because you all would have lived if only like it's it's so weird it's so weird and I don't know what there is to gain from this. It's it's it's my eyes are shooting like 80 directions. I'm like on fire from the story. It's so weird. What data read out is this booking a gig performing on that. Like another thing and this is stupid but like the Titanic now like they've made ships bigger than the Titanic. So you're not even like getting on anything. It's not like oh we're getting on like a really big fancy cruise ship like they've they've outdone it and they've made ones that I want to do. It's not even it's not even half the size of Jeff Bezos is yeah. Hey by the way do you know what also exists. Museums can we just turn it into one of those. There was there was a great Titanic exhibit. Remember you got to touch the big wall of ice and you're like fuck it was cold. It seems shitty that seemed that seemed horrific. You have been floating in that icy water. Just watch Titanic. Just watch Titanic. Don't they re-releasated theaters every year. Right. Unless Kathy Bates is on this boat and period garb you got to not get on that boat. Just watch the movie guys. Also I am pretty sure you do not get your insurance money if you die on the Titanic too. I would not pay that out. I wouldn't. Wow what do you got what do you got. That's the other thing I'm like well I. That might be the widest nonsense of the year. That has got to be. You know because you know everyone else is like are these ones you really got to get on that boat again. Like are they really do they know what happened. They love hats that much. You know uber wants to deliver burgers be a drones by the way white people have been wild this week. Anyway my keep it. This is this is like young and the restless. I keep returning to the soap opera saga of Gavin Newsome Donald Trump junior Kimberly golf oil still. This half a two man who loves slick pomade in Greenfield Indiana at a rally said I've known the president for 15 years and his son well I know him a little better. Oh gross. I do not need to hear about Don juniors dick. Stop stop. Also this woman does not need to talk like a dynasty character. Also is he still married. Why is she a campaign rallies. Yeah what does she bring. Why is he still doing campaign rallies. This is divorce got through yet. I find this whole thing disgusting. Like you really have lost the conservative moral high ground that they pretend that they're on when we're just cavorting around with your new woman. Well the ink isn't even trying to divorce yet. Why why why are you talking about this dick at a rally. I'm also listen. I I recently filled out my my ballot. I think I did vote for Gavin Newsom. So it's just a message to you buddy because I think you're probably going to win. Can you be a little better than this once your governor please because I don't like this. I don't like any of this that's happening. I don't like being reminded that you thought this woman was a suitable partner for you. I don't like being reminded that this bitch was almost the first lady of California. I don't like it. So please now be a little better so we can forget that you're all related to these people. Well he cheated on her. So I don't I don't. Allegedly. So I thought it was who is the one that cheated with his best friends. Wife like his campaign manager's wife. Enough frankly it just mentioned not being charged. We already know too much. Yes. We know too much. No more men in charge of literally anything. Oh yeah. I voted for him too. So come on bud. Be better. Better than this. It's not hard to be better than these people. It's not hard to not the girl standing up at the rally making gross ass like Donald Trump Jr. references. I know him a little better. Oh with like a Betty Boop glance like not even. Oh. Him and those giant belt buckles. You always see him in. Yeah. He's polo tucked in and the bell buckle and like the jacket that's stupid. Well even those guys are doing French tucks. God Queer eyes change things. He is so dumb. He looks like Ed Grimley. Anyway I call him a living high five left hanging just like put it there and then like the other person's like get away from me. We could make fun of Donald Trump Jr. all day. But we won't. I got to say too. I don't gun to my head if you put a picture of the two of the other one. Eric not sure that I could get it right. Right. No they're like minor characters like I kind of know but no. Right. No they both like they could be in like Glengary Glen Ross in the background. I don't know. But I also don't care. Yeah. Anyway that's our show. We'll see you next week. Well Lewis and I will see you next week. It's true. Care won't be here. I won't be here for two weeks guys. I'm sorry. They're both looking at me like I strangled their puppies. Heart shaped tears streaming from my face. She's going to make TV. I'm going to make television. I'm going to go do that. Toronto. Which is a Toronto industry by the way. Yes. Yes. So I'm going to be in Toronto so I will not be here to record but I will be back because God knows they need me. Yeah. Will you come back? Lewis might not even be here either. I'm just going to be a full swap out. It's going to be like Jacks or somebody. Just step. I can't wait till that's the swap. I can't wait to find out. I'll see you all in two weeks. Yeah. Peace out."
