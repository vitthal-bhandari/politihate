    "text": " data points. So what do you want the press to be doing differently in its day by day coverage of your economy? Well, I think that the big problem has been that the the coverage has tended, you know, kind of the bleeds it leads, but this time in economic data, the negatives get all of the attention and there's a lot of polling that indicates that people, you know, it's one thing for people to say, look, the inflation matters to be more than the job gains, but a plurality of voters appear to not be aware that we've been gaining jobs. You know, people just don't know. They people say they've heard more news items reporting negative news on employment than positive and employment is, of course, the economy is a good point. So I think that what's happening now is that there's been a kind of a negativity bias in coverage. And just, you know, the press should be giving people people have their own person. I can only take so much of that. Cortez, he also, I think it was Stelter, he also said, we're not in a recession, recessions, there's not two quarters in a row. There's spinning as hard as they can spin, sir. Tell us what's reality. Yeah, he also said, Krugman did, that it didn't matter whether or not in a recession. Well, it matters to regular people. It might not matter to smug New York media mavens like Stelter and Krugman, but believe me, it matters to regular working class citizens. He also said that when he talks to people that they tell him that things are fine. And I put this on my social media, I said, who is he talking to? Only people in the private aviation terminal at Teeterboro Airport. He's not talking to regular Americans if he believes that regular folks think things are fine out there. Now, let's look talk with some actual data because Krugman, despite the fact, by the way, talk about failure of credentialism, despite the fact that he has a Nobel Prize when it comes to the economy, he is a moron. So don't listen to him. Instead, look at the numbers, look at the data, make your own decision. So let's get to some actual data about what's going on out there and let's use thousands and thousands of data points that are incredibly important. And let's go to chart number one. This is the Small Business Optimism Index. That index is crashing. That chart goes back one year. The NFIB, the National Federation of Independent Business, is the largest organization by far in the country representing entrepreneurs and small business owners. As you can see from that chart, their confidence is absolutely tanking. That is the on-the-ground reality. And it's not tanking because they get negative news reports, as Krugman tries to say on the economy. It's tanking because they know they can't pay their bills. We know from a separate, allainable survey that 35% of them in June, we don't have July numbers yet, 35% of them said they didn't make rent in June. Okay, that's not a media narrative. That's not bad messaging. That is a terrible economy that they can't handle. If we go to the next chart, chart number two, also from the NFIB, this is, I think in some ways even worse because this is the forward-looking index from small business owners. And it is a net negative 61, positive versus negative. This is the lowest this index has ever been, Steve. For a survey that goes back four decades. Small business owners have never been more pessimistic about their future prospects when they look down the road at what is in front of them. And yet Paul Krugman wants us to believe, oh no, the economy's fine. And it doesn't matter if we're in a recession. Oh, and I talked to somebody in the Hamptons or a couple of people at some high-priced coffee shop who told me that things were fine in their life. They are totally disconnected from reality, real fully so. But again, there's always opportunity in calamity. There's opportunity for us as a movement for the America First Movement. And we've got a lot of work to do tomorrow in some key states. Joe Kent up in Washington State, Masters in Lake in Arizona. Joe Gibbs in Tudor Dixon, and Judge C.V. John Gibbs in Tudor Dixon in Michigan. We have work to do to elect these America First Champions who are going to start the really hard work of fixing this Biden-Palestinian McConnell mess, of digging us out of this economic morass. And the American people know damn well that we're in one, no matter what Stelter tries to spin with Paul Krugman. No, they keep saying about the jobs and all the jobs that came back because people went back to work after COVID and the relief stopped. But the small business, which is the engine of job growth, is cratering before ours in the, in the statistics are all out there. So it's not like, oh, they can't see a month down the, down range. The jobs in the retail sector, the jobs across the board by small businesses, because hey, if you ain't paying rent, that means you can barely pay, make payroll, right? So in the landlords are going to take so much of not paying rent before things get serious. And Steve, your second court, doesn't get? Yeah, go ahead, sir. Go ahead. Well, I just want to make a point too. I care more about small business for sure than big business, because I think big business abuses the American people so much. But we're seeing this at the big end as well, the same kind of weakness. We've talked quite a bit in recent weeks about Walmart, which has had two massive gaps down in its stock price in just the last three months. So even some of the most skilled executives in the entire world of retailing and really just business, they can't manage it. We got another data point though, just on Friday that we haven't mentioned yet, Procter & Gamble, another very well-run behemoth. And again, I'm not fans of these companies because I think they engage in corporate cultural Marxism. So I'm not praising P&G as a company that I like. But the point is it's very representative of what's going on with the consumer because they're so ubiquitous all over the country. Procter & Gamble fell 6% in stock in a single day for a company that's normally pretty boring, a stock that is normally pretty predictable. 6% it fell on Friday. That shows you that the bottom is falling out regarding the consumer and that this inflation explosion is not just unmanageable for small businesses, it's even unmanageable for big business. It's unfortunately totally broad and it is a reality that Americans face every day, even if CNN wants to pretend it doesn't exist. No, those companies are steady yeties and when they come with those kind of surprises, you know that there's nothing but instability and tectonic plate shift underneath. Hang for a second Cortez. I want to bring in Ben Hart, we got Finsham and Laker are going to come up from Arizona. Ben, you found a great buried lead today. It's very important. Talk to us about what you've the quote you found the financial times and what does that mean for Zelensky? Because you see in Europe there's a major shift going on before our eyes on the politics of this Ukraine warcer. Okay, come on, Steve. So here's the quote, it's the opening paragraph in this article and if folks want to want to dig deeper and get to the article itself, it's on both at Hanwell on Getter and also at Steve Bannon. European governments have eased back on efforts to curb trade in Russian oil, delaying a plan to shut Moscow out of the vital lords, loids of London maritime insurance market and allowing some international shipments, mid-fares of rising crude prices and tighter global energy supplies. So that's basically the introduction to this development. Back on the 4th of June, the European Union had introduced this embargo, the U.S. embargo on Russian oil and in tied in with that was a prohibition on insurance of oil carrying vessels. And that's specifically the link in the the whole, the link in the chain mail. Interestingly, just scrolling down this article is the fact that really the EU is trying to shift blame onto the UK, sort of no longer thanks to Brexit part of the European Union as having not replicated the same measures and London is still the central insurance, global insurance hub there. So they said, we know if the UK is not following in with this, there's very little point in the EU enforcing it. Really, however, the reason why the UK didn't follow through was not to be awkward or to go against the EU because of course, as we know, Boris Johnson is in the first tier of slavishly proselynsky European leaders. It's the United States that put pressure and expressing concern saying that an immediate global ban on maritime insurance would push up prices by pulling millions of barrels of Russian crude and petroleum products off the market. So that was really the reason. And that's just despite the happy talk that's coming out of the administration, the economy's fine and everything. And as you and Steve Cortez were just sort of laughingly referring to Paul Krugman as saying, no one's feeling any difficulty. The reality is that just a couple of months away from the elections midterms in November, the US administration, the Biden administration is acutely aware of the disaster that it's created, but doesn't have to pull back for me. Let me just go for the TV audience, our radio thing. The financial times like West, Eases, Russian oil curbs as inflation and energy risk mount. Read inflation energy risk as risk to their governments. This is why the whole, the things cratering right now, the whole thing over, we're not going to buy it, we can't do it. No, they're doing the exact opposite. This is why the de-escalation is coming from people who, the people are putting political pressure on like in Italy, like in France, like in Germany, talking about social, we're in a situation now that the financial times of London and other papers are talking about social unrest in Germany and China. I want you to think about that for a second. In Germany and China, their words not ours. They're talking about social unrest for the energy problem that the elites in Germany have caused the German people and the banking scandal and the real estate scandal for Lao Bai Jing in China. That's where they put tanks in front of the Bank of China. Also the Boyce from Brazil. Top story today about Edwarda Bolsonar, and it starts off with yours truly. Stephen K. Bannon in discussions with Edwarda Bolsonar. We'll get all that up. Ben, I had a lot more to do with you on the Pope, but we've got to do it at another time tonight or tomorrow. How do people get to your social media, sir? It's my exclusive social media platform. Just look for me at on what Steve. Can you just give me 30 seconds? I just want to book in what you were just saying. In the article that I was just talking about, the United States was pushing on the European Union rather than the embargo of putting a price ceiling on oil, on Russian oil. Which country in Europe was the most open, which country was leading from the front, amongst all of the 27 EU member states. Which country was leading from the front in arguing for the price ceiling on Russian oil experts? It was Mario Darragi. We saw what happened to him. He's gone. I think this is starting to even in people as artistically blind in death to reality as the Biden administration. They're starting to realize now that they're next. Ben Harnewell, great reporting. You've been on top of this and found all the buried leads about what's really going on. We're like, we got to talk about the Pope's disaster strip to Canada. Nobody showed up. Nobody cared. We'll get to all that. And all the time, Steve Cortez. Cortez, where'd I let you go? When the FTS got the West Eases Russian oil curves, right? When all you hear on MSNBC is, oh, they're winning and we're going to triple down from us as a street guy, sir, as far as they tell, go, who's about where trades are going to go. What does that tell you, sir? Right. Well, you know, yes, to connect this to financial market as a street guy, look at the euro currency. So the dollar has been getting crushed relative to real assets, right? Things like commodities and real estate. But the euro currency is getting crushed even more. Hence, the euro against the dollar has been going decidedly for an entire year against the euro currency a year ago. I believe it was right about 117. It's gotten all the way down to parity now or just above right now. But it got even below parity a little bit, one to one, something that people thought wasn't possible just months ago. And the main reason is Ukraine and the dependence of Western Europe on Russian energy. So as bad as this Ukraine escalation situation is for us, and it's quite bad for the United States, it is massively worse, legions' worth for Western Europeans. And I think, by the way, to connect this to what Ben was saying, that's one of the reasons why the continental European politicians actually seem to be somewhat reasonable when it comes to Russia, at least compared to the US and UK. So Macron, somebody who I don't agree with how much of anything, Macron has actually several times argued in favor of de-escalation and said, we cannot ice completely isolate Russia. We cannot act as though there's an existential threat there. But then when it comes to Boris Johnson and Joe Biden, we hear exactly the opposite. So unfortunately, there's this Anglo-American alliance that is pushing it extremely hard for escalation. It's bad for us, but it's even worse for Europe because of their total dependency on Russian energy. Something which, by the way, Steve, is important to note, something which Donald Trump warned them about. He was mocked by the Europeans at the time. He was completely eviscerated by the US media for supposedly having no idea what he was talking about. Look, like many of the statements of his, which may at the time seem to be a bit aggressive or a bit outlandish, he was very prescient and he was exactly correct. And here's the worst of it bringing back home to the US for getting for a second about the foreign affairs aspect is, thankfully, the United States, we are in a position of natural resources bestowed on us by Almighty God that we never have to be dependent. We have chosen to be dependent on foreign sources of energy only because of Joe Biden and his first major action in office of attacking American domestic energy production. It's an absolute dereliction of duty. It is a policy crime and we have been paying the price for literally literally paying the price for a year and a half. Part of fixing that, though, is what happens tomorrow, Steve. Let's connect this back to elections. Tomorrow's a huge day from MAGA. It's a huge day for our country. For America first, it's really almost like a super Tuesday. Our candidates have to win. Cortez, real quickly, your social media and sub-stack. Yeah, please find me at Steve and the sub-stack is there on the closing argument for John Gibbs. That's my Twitter at Steve at Cortez Steve on Twitter. The Guardian newspaper, the leading progressive left newspaper in the world, two days in a row, the cover story, Arizona. Today, it's Kerry, Lake and Mark Fincham. The election deniers all next in the war room. You know what's never good? When your nation's supposed authority on economic policy completely misses the flashing red lights of impending inflation. Now, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has finally admitted, quote, there's been an unanticipated and large shocks to the economy that have boosted energy and food prices and supply bottlenecks that affected our economy badly that I didn't at the time fully understand, end quote. You know who understands the real threat of inflation?

See, Bowers be booted from office after testifying in front of the January 6th Select Committee, but you're also looking at the potential that Donald Trump could have a clean sweep of victories among his other endorsed candidates. Not only is Blake Masters a top polling for the U.S. Senate seat, but even if Blake Masters were not to pull it off, Jim Lehman is second in that race and has been a consistent Trump act light. But the other races that we are going to be talking about in the days ahead are the Governor's race with Kerry Lake, Secretary of State Race with Mark Fincham, Abe Homide is running for Attorney General. Each of those three with Donald Trump's endorsement, each of those three have called for the de-certification of the 2020 election and the giving of the electoral college votes to Donald Trump despite Joe Biden legitimately winning the state of Arizona. And those candidates could win, not because of a lack of money being spent against them. Just say Kerry Lake's race, for example, she's facing Karen Taylor-Robeson, who has the endorsement of Mike Pence and Doug Ducey entering this weekend. Karen Taylor-Robeson's campaign spent $18.3 million on her group editorial bid compared to Kerry Lake, just $3.5 million. Kerry Lake, despite that advantage financially for Karen Taylor-Robeson, could pull off a win. We have a potential here where these candidates, these Trump act candidates, could really set a path of how Republican voters want their party to go looking ahead. The Guardian newspaper in England, it used to be called the Manchoa Seguardian, is the, it sets the thought framework for the progressive movement throughout the world, more powerful than even the New York Times in that regard. I've been at this for a long time now. Two days in a row, the lead story in the Guardian has been the race in Arizona. I've never seen that, not a state race. People understand the importance of what's happening in Arizona. Arizona is the railhead of the big steel. It's also the railhead of ultra-maga and the maga movement. President Trump in conservatism, real true conservatism. I've got Kerry Lake running for governor in Mark Fincham. Let me start with Fincham. Mark, right there. And by the way, MSNBC, if you're going to lift directly from the pages of a war room, how about a name check or a shout out? I mean, that's like they just take that was just a pure war room right there. You know, it's holiday, it's Fincham, it's Lake, it's D certification. Mark, in your opinion, the Secretary of State races, which never got any exposure at all, why is it that your race has attracted global media, sir? Well, because the Secretary of State is the perhaps the most meaningful of offices in all of state government when it comes to regulating the behavior of the very people that are supposed to supervise elections. Now, what I don't understand, and I've said this on your show before, they're in full Chernobyl meltdown mode over the notion that I, as a Secretary of State, would seek to faithfully and with fidelity, hold people accountable for following existing law. Because Mark, if they can't cheat, they can't win. Let me just give you a news flash. No two Mark Fincham. I think that this whole thing is about message over money. And I'm glad that you brought up the MSNBC piece over the tsunami of money that Karen Taylor Robson is paying for this over what Kerry's been able to pay. It's message over money. I don't think that you can buy enough ad time to talk people into believing something that they know not to be true. And that's one of the reasons that I think Kerry is doing so well. She's got a spot on message that resonates with the people of Arizona. I've got a spot on message that resonates with the people of Arizona about securing fair elections. Hard stop. It's not complicated other than fixing the mess that it's been turned into under Katie Hobbs and some of the individuals that have been essentially lawless when it comes to enforcing election law. Mark, in the next 24 hours, where do people go? We're beyond reading every notes that the differences are here. This is all about who shows up. So how are we going to get how are we going to get your folks to show up? Where do they go? How do people volunteer? What do they have to do in the next 24 hours? Well, the best thing they can do to help me is go to the polls tomorrow and vote in person. Don't try to mail a ballot in if you've got early voting because it's not going to come. You can drop an early ballot off. I believe today, if you do it at one of the government collection centers in Maricopa County. But if you are in rural Arizona, don't try and mail a ballot in. You're going to have to go to the polls. Point number two, I need to have everybody download the VOTFI Now app. That's B-O-T-I-F-Y-N-O-W app. Get yourself a user identity. And if you spot something that you think is nefarious, if you think that there's something going on in your particular area, whether it's extra ballots or questionable behavior, you see somebody stuffing ballots into a ballot box that just doesn't look right, take a picture, create an incident report and submit it. It goes into a national database of basically evidence for any causes of action. And then number three, go to votefincham.com. That's V-O-T-E-F is in Frank, I-N-C-H-E-M.com. You can click on the context tab. We need to have volunteers and we're going to need to have volunteers for the general election. So this isn't just something that happens in the next 24 hours. This is something that's ongoing. And of course, if you want to donate, we're going to have to raise a lot of money against the Democrats. They've already raised about two and a half million dollars to come against me. This is going to be a bloodbath in Arizona. It certainly is. Okay, next 24 hours. One more time. Where do they go to get out the vote in the next 24 hours of volunteer in the next 24 hours? Where do they go? Votefincham.com and click on the context tab up in the upper right hand corner. Just fill in your name. Email address, phone number, and we will reach out to you. Mark Finchem, fight on, sir. Tough 24 hours ahead of you. Kerry Lake. Kerry Lake. When you first came on, you started your campaign. I think we were the first show you came on. If you had told me at the time that somebody would put $18.3 million in a Republican primary, no, it is incomprehensible. And for folks in politics, people are gobsmacked about that. And three and a half, but you're ahead. Tell the nation, how is Kerry Lake ahead having $18.3 million dumped on you in TV ads in Arizona, ma'am? Not to mention the legacy media won't cover me. We've gotten here, Steve, because we're all about telling the truth and revealing the truth to the people. And that's what the people crave and want, and they want to fight her. And the legacy media refused to cover me for a long time. And if they did cover me, it was just hit pieces. I can't get interviews on some of the big shows. They only want the rhino on there. And it's been people like you and the alternative media, independent journalists who've reached out to me have done podcasts. And I've got a message that resonates with the people. We're going to make sure we have honest elections and a secure board of the two things that the you want to call it deep state, you want to call it swamp, don't want, but the people do want. And that's what we're going to get with a governor Kerry Lake. And I'm so proud of our team, how far we've come. We've worked, we've outworked everyone. I can't think of anybody who's worked harder than my team and myself, crisscrossing this state. We started the day in Colorado City, one of a small community that doesn't get a lot of attention. We ended the day in Tucson with a massive rally. People are energized and getting out the votes not going to be hard because we've been tortured by our government for the past three years because gas prices are so high. You can't afford groceries. It's going to be real easy to get people out to vote tomorrow. And I want to remind them they can vote today because we have early voting. So get out today or tomorrow, but don't miss this opportunity to change the course of politics in Arizona. Politics in Arizona in the country. I mean, by the way, the rally last night in Tucson is a university town. I mean, it's got a lot of great concerns, huge maga, but you drew it. Look like a thousand people at this. How did that happen? How did you get a thousand people to come out in uber liberal Tucson, ma'am? There was a line around the block to get in. It was so great. I took the stage. I said they say this is a liberal town. I don't believe it. Tucson is so ready for some meaningful change. The people down there talk about being tortured with that socialist mayor. And people are excited about the maga candidates. They're excited that we're going to take all the things President Trump did in the Oval Office, bringing America first policies and with the candidates such as myself, we're going to bring those to Arizona. Somebody called me Trump, a female version of Trump, a little softer around the edges. And I take that as the highest compliment. I have immense respect for President Trump, what he gave up for this country, what he continues to do for this country. And he has aired a generation of people, a leg his legacy of leaders coming up behind him that they thought they were getting rid of us and they can't get rid of us because we love this country too much to let it go. And we're going to fight until we save this republic. It's just amazing. Steve, the crowd was out of control super hot amazing. And I just can't believe for a Sunday night we brought a crowd out like that. Kerry, if you just hang on for a second, we'll take a short break. I know you get a bounce. I just want to talk to you about one of the reasons that you have a relationship with the people of Arizona, particularly in the Phoenix area, because you've been a major newscaster for a couple of decades. But I think, and I want the answer to hold for the break, I think one of the reasons that the establishment and the legacy media hate you so much and they do hate you is the reason they hate Trump. Trump was part of the system. And then he said, hey, I got to give that up to go save my country. Donald Trump could have had golf courses throughout the world, golf courses, the British Open Championship, all of it. That was all loving family. He gave all that up to be tortured like he is, because it's a patriot to save his country. I saw it up close and personal. He didn't have to do this. He did it for his love of his country and his country men. The same, I've seen the same hatred of you by the legacy media and by the establishment. They're like, hey, Kerry Lake was a major TV personality. Now she's like, she's gone to the dark side. She's talking about magga. She's talking about borders. She's talking about making things work for working class people in the middle class. And that's not what they want to hear. That's not the game. Sure commercial break. Kerry Lake, a historic run in Arizona, 18.3 million dollars has been dropped on her head. And she's still up. Short break. Kerry Lake next from Arizona. War room pandemic with Stephen K. Banner. The epidemic is a demon and we can't let this demon hide. War room pandemic. Here's your host, Stephen K. Banner. Okay, Walmart kicked him out, but the war room did not go to my pillow dot com right now promo code war room. Get the best deals. You get $19.80 cents for the pillow that Walmart, the big box through Lindell F4 plus everything else. The buy one get one's freeze the sheets the slippers the biblical blankets and pillows all of it. Go there today support the owner of your screenshot tomorrow. I'm giving it at six o'clock. In our six o'clock battleground state, we're actually going to take an entire hour and go through Arizona. Why now why it's important that details of demographics, economics, what made Arizona become the principal fight that the entire world is looking at. Okay. So tomorrow night with six, you're not going to miss it after our five o'clock show. I want to go back to Kerry Lake Kerry. You've had 18.3 million dollars and much more. The free media, the opposition's got is outrageous. You fought this with President Trump in this in the Trump movement and you galvanize working class Hispanics. It's just been amazing. Where are you going to be? How can people get to you in this in this last day in the run up before voting starts in person? I guess you got early voting today, but also tomorrow's election day. I know you're going to have a big rally tonight. Where do people go? How do they find you, ma'am? Go to my website, Kerry Lake.com K-A-R-I-L-A-K-E.com. The event tonight is in Phoenix at a place called the Duce and it's going to be the MAGA candidates. We're continuing part two of MAGA Fest tonight and go vote today. I mean, you don't have to wait till tomorrow. Go on up to one of the voting centers and vote today. They're scared to death of us, but we're going to be a great thing for Arizona. We are going to reform Arizona and get rid of all of the corruption in Arizona that we've been living with for far too long. We're at ground zero here when it comes to our border and our rotten elections and we're going to straighten things out. We just want honesty and truth and I think the people really want that. It's evident when you see the crowds we draw. Do you see what I was saying that one of the reasons they particularly look they're all over every MAGA candidate, they're getting on top of it, but they particularly have singled you out? Like Trump. Do you think it's because you were part of the media establishment there? Are you a well-known personality and they take personal umberts with that man? I think a little bit of that, but I think they're more worried about me doing what I say I'm going to do. Securing the border and restoring honesty to our election. And when we do that, their whole system crumbles because they can't win on ideas. Their policies, pardon my French, suck. They can't win on their policies. They got a cheat in order to win. And we're just going to restore honesty and they can't stand that. We're going to end their human smuggling. We're going to end their drug smuggling. We're going to end their sex trafficking. And we are going to make Arizona the greatest state in the country and that scares the hell out of them. I think that's why they're after me. And the funny thing is, you know, you said 18 million. It's going to be more like 26 million when you take all the dark money through Karen's friends that they pumped into this. And we have, we're still standing. We're not injured. We're not hurt. Because the people of this great state, Steve, have welcomed me into their homes for 27 years. They know who I am in my heart and in my soul. And all these lies she's put out, all the slander and defamation that they've thrown at me. It won't work because I have a relationship with the people. I've been in their homes every day. We've been through thick and thin. We've been through the good days and the bad days. We've laughed together, cried together. And they know me. They know me. And they know that this other woman I'm running against is a liar trying to buy this election and the people of Arizona won't have it. Kerry, Lake, one more time. How do people get to your site to find out where to go to Phoenix tonight and how to participate? Thank you, Kerry, Lake.com, K-A-R-I-L-A-K-E.com. We're really excited about tomorrow. We're having a big event tomorrow night. We believe we're going to be celebrating a huge victory. And then it's onward to take on the socialist Democrat, Krat, Demerat. I don't know. Rat, let's just call it that. Katie Hobbs. Katie Hobbs. Kerry, Lake, fight on, ma'am. Watch out, Katie. I'm coming for you. Thank you, Steve. Thank you. The indefatigable. Kerry, Lake. Okay. A story and a head-attract Mike Davis down the Great Mike Davis from Article 3 before he's doing some traveling coming up. Mike, over the weekend, you found this. Or somebody found it for me. You and I talked about it. The effent. It's blockbuster news, but only the great post-millennial, which is part of the Jack Passobac and the guy's attorney, point, Charlie Kirk's operation, have made a story about it. I want you to tell the audience, take your time here, tell the audience what we're finding out about the assassination attempt on Justice Kavanaugh, which still, you know, the Guardian had a huge story about the rise of political violence and didn't mention this once. Sir. Yeah. So it's Mr. Andy Neoh, NGO, Mr. A-N-D-Y-N-G-O. Put this on Twitter and getter. That's this 20, this 25-year-old man, 26-year-old man, Nicholas Rosky, is the suspect in the Capitol assassination attempt. He admitted he was doing it. The affidavit's submitted by the FBI show that Rosky identifies as a transsexual woman and goes by the name of Sophie. And like you said, that wasn't reported anywhere. People will say, well, how's that relevant? That's a kind of a bombshell, isn't it? Because he talks about, here's why it's relevant. He talks about shifting. This guy had a well-thought-through plan. And he had a bigger agenda saying, for history, I can flip the entire court. I've got to kill three. Did he not, sir? Yeah, he did. I mean, if you look at this plot, the post-planale posted this story, I mean, it's pretty damning stuff. We have this Rosky showing up at Kavanaugh's house at one o'clock in the morning. He's in Chevy Chase, Maryland, gets out of a cab. He has, they found a suitcase and a backpack on him with a tactical, police vest, tactical knife, pepper spray, zip ties, Glock, pistol, two magazines, an ammunition. And they found burglary tools, including a hammer, screwdriver, nail punch, crowbar, pistol, light, duct tape, and a pair of hiking boots with padded shoes on the soles. Now, you can say, okay, this guy's clearly crazy, but he's certainly not going to meet any definition of insanity here. He knew exactly what he was doing, and he tried to hide what he was doing as evidenced by his padded shoes. So he's not just some deranged animal who's insane who can claim insanity here. This guy had a well-thought-out plan. And the fact that the media is not covering this is stunning. And we go to the fact that he identifies as a trans woman, just imagine if this were a Trump supporter showing up to Justice Kagan or Sotomayor or Jackson's house or a white nationalist or whatever the hell the level. But it speaks to a different deeper issue of it, not just his motives, but his strategy. He got to the point. He said, if I can kill three, then we can flip the court, we can flip the court back and that will have massive ramifications, which I hate to be brutally fraying raised correct. This is why, why is this not a national security emergency with Merrick Garland and the FBI and the Secret Service and the Federal Protective Service and the court marshals? What are we talking about? This is everything and the evidence is right there from this kid. And he ain't the only, I am not smearing the progressive left, et cetera. They've got full rights that we do to get in heated conversations, do what you got to do, get people out. That's the American political process, and God bless them. I like when they fight hard. This is different. Okay, this is very different. And there are people out there like this guy. You think this guy's a lone wolf? You would be incorrect. And I'm not saying he's working in concert with anybody, but Mike, there are other people out there thinking down this line. And this is why where is Merrick Garland, the FBI, what is going on in the governors? I don't understand what Yunken and Hogan, two Republican governors have not put up a quarter down there and shut the whole thing down. Sir, now that this Roskey has identified as Sophie, the media is definitely going to bury this story forever because it doesn't fit their political narrative. But if you think about this, you had the Biden White House encouraging these illegal obstruction of justice campaigns at these justices homes from the White House podium. Jen Psaki, the former White House Press Secretary, encouraged these things. Merrick Garland has refused to enforce federal statute, 18 USC 1507, that makes it a federal crime to show up at a federal judges home and have harassed and intimidate them. You do not have a First Amendment right to obstruct justice. And then we had a senior Biden Justice Department official go testify in the House, at the House Judiciary Committee, that these these obstruction campaigns are protected by the First Amendment. They are absolutely not protected by the First Amendment, the Supreme Court in 1965 and Cox versus Louisiana made it very clear that these obstruction campaigns are not protected by the First Amendment. And just last week, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that you can arrest people for protesting within 200 feet of a courthouse. So if you're going to arrest people for protesting within 200 feet of a courthouse, and that doesn't violate the First Amendment, sure the hell doesn't violate the First Amendment to go harass Supreme Court justices and their families in their homes. Merrick Garland is encouraging this through his amnesty. And again, I keep saying this, he needs to be held accountable. The House Republicans must impeach him in January for letting this go on where it's led to his assassination, this assassination attempt, and other justices rewoping their homes. Mike, one of the reasons the audience loves you so much, you were in a law practice and you gave it up to go be a clerk for Gorsuch, you've been inside the system, you're not a madman like us, you're not a bomb, though, or did you ever could you imagine when you were clerk a situation we were actually be talking about, the potential assassination of Supreme Court justices, sir? Just imagine, we have Judge Katau, Justice Katauji Brown Jackson, first black woman on the Supreme Court, just imagine if people showed up to her house and protested before the Supreme Court rules on the affirmative action case next term. People would go ballistic and they shut its obstructive they should it would be it would be unacceptable. It would be unacceptable to do that. You agree on it totally unacceptable. I'm correct. I'm screaming just as loudly if you did it to Kagan by your big time Jackson, just like I'm doing for the six Republic Republican appointed. This is a deadly game and we saw this with this Raski person. Raski almost killed a Supreme Court Justice, his wife and their two young doctors. I mean, it's a lot closer than people understand. By the way, if we were not through the grace of God and his sister, you would have had Justice Kavanaugh and their kids assassinated. It was just it was just purely divine providence that that happened. He had a change and his sister they had to change her heart and able to contact some people that stopped it. There wasn't protection there and he had the tools to do it. Mike Davis, I know you get to go ahead. I have to be careful. The US marshals were there. So I had to be careful what I say here. So I don't reveal any inside secrets. But the Supreme Court Justice's half protection, it has been substantially increased. If people try to harm or do more to a Supreme Court Justice, they're going to end up in prison or dead. That needs to be said very loudly and clearly. But this it was but more but more me to be done and they need to stop the protest in these neighborhoods. Their neighbors and these people should not be intimidated. And this goes for Judge Jackson Brown, Brown Jackson. This goes for Kagan Sotomayor. All of it. It's not totally unacceptable. Totally unacceptable. Mike, how do people get to you, sir? Yes. Article three project.org, article number three projects.org. And then at article three, at Gether and Twitter, article number three, MRD, DMI is my personal MRD, DMI. And thank you, Steve. Thank you, brother. Thanks for changing your schedule. I'm going to come do this. The 80th birthday of Jerry Garcia. He never got that far. So we're honoring Jerry Garcia.

Okay, Edward Bolsonaro is going to join us in CPAC. Lead story on the cover of the financial times. The boy from Brazil, Bolsonaro's third son provides a key link to Trump's inner circle. Of course, inside the paper, it's a full-blown story. Edwarda is going to be at CPAC talk all about this and that massive election coming up right there. Huge story. We're going to talk about it later this afternoon. But also, Edwarda will join us. I don't know if Thursday, Friday, we'll figure it all out. But want to make sure everybody gets to know what's going on down in Brazil. Okay, Raymond Ibrahim, one of our regulars on here, contributed just to such a fantastic job of getting us up to speed on what's happening in this great fight against radical Islam. His new book is that, A Ford by Victor Davis-Hanson, Defenders of the West, the Christian heroes who stood against Islam. And I'm telling you, this is one for not just get for yourself, but if you get a grandson or granddaughter, this is something you want to get to inspire them. It is just amazing. St. Louis, Richard the Lion-hearted, El Cid, Dracula, Count Vlad. Raymond, walk us through the book. What inspires you, and I got to tell you, this is a page, I actually got it on a Friday, I think, afternoon in Reddit. I was done by Sunday morning. It was just amazing, sir. One sitting, one long sitting. That's great, Steve. I'm glad you liked it. So, yeah, the book, it's a companion book to Sordin Simitar, my previous book. And as I was writing that book, which was the broad history of military conflict between Islam and the Western world, I would read and come across all these really remarkable tales of heroism and valor of a lot of these characters that I ended up writing about. And I wanted to, because I didn't have much time in the first book in Sordin Simitar, to really kind of zoom in on the lives of these men, eight of them. And they are, as you indicated, God-free, Duke God-free of the First Crusade, who becomes the first king of Jerusalem and El Cid. Most people, if they've heard of El Cid, they just know Charlton Heston's movie, which is not very accurate when it comes to the conflict of Islam. And then King Richard Lionhearted and Saint Ferdinand and Saint Louis, who were actually first cousins, one was a king of Spain and one the king of France. And then we moved to the Balkans, to John Hunyadi of Hungary, and then Skanderbeg, who's probably in many ways the least known. And at the same time, the most popular, historically, is... He's like the Braveheart, right, the character. It's just... Yeah, definitely. His story is, if you want to encapsulate it, it's a story of William Wallace, Braveheart, basically for a quarter of a century, he defied the Ottomans with one-twentieth of their power and just completely humiliated them over and over and over again. I want to, by the way, the books, the page turner, but I want to say something about Bommadyr, the press, and Adam Bello, your publisher. The quality of the photographs and images and paintings is extraordinary, particularly they've taken the time to put in many of these in color. These are inspirational, just fabulous. I know you handpicked them, but the curation process, you could have written about 30 or 40 or 50. You had to curate this, but it's stunning. It is inspirational. For everybody out there has a son or a daughter that you want to imbue with proper values. You can't do better. The fenders of the West, the Christian heroes who stood against Islam and the Ford by Victor Davis-Hanson, the whole thing is fantastic. How did you give us a... How did you actually narrow it down to, was it eight or 10? I think it's eight? Is it eight or 10? Yeah, it was eight. How did you narrow it down eight? Earlier I cast my net and I had, you know, potentially up to 20. I was going to write short biographies, but it just became inevitable. Every biography I would write, each chapter just grew and grew and it needed more information. So I ended up just having to select and narrow it down as much as I could. Hopefully, there may be another book at some time where I can bring in some other ones, especially fast forwarding and moving to more of the modern era because that's another, there's a vacuum in the historical studies as far as what happened then. But I think one of the chief things with the book is, you know, we live in a day and age today where we just, there is no such thing as heroism or valor or self-sacrifice and it seems like every American has imbibed this idea, which is very cynical at root. And you can't. And that's why so many of these politicians get away with murder because we just assume it's okay for them to be, you know, opportunistic and cynical and hypocritical. But what's interesting is you see in this book, I mean, these weren't just some regular guys, these were kings, these were lords and dukes and counts and they gave up so much, including up to their life, just for a right cause and just for their faith and their belief. And I think people need to be reminded of this, their heritage that it exists and it's something that can be and hopefully will be reclaimed again. This is your heritage. Incredible valor and charitable bravery. How do, what do people go, I know they go to Amazon right now, where else they go to bombardier, your own personal site, where do people get more information on you and more information about the book? Well, while my website, Raymond at rheem.com has a lot of links, including for the book and information on the book. And really I'm seeing it, it's appearing in all sorts of booksellers, Barnes and Nobles and so forth. You can probably buy it online or actually get it physically. Well, if you go to your bookstore today or tomorrow, I guess you'll be able to know it came out, it came out last year. So actually in bookstore for right now, let's make sure we go get it from the author of Sordin Sematar, the fenders of the West, the Christian heroes who stood against Islam, Ford by Victor Davis, Tansan, Magdives, Obama, dear Adam Bellows, they done, they done good here.
