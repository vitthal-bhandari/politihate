    "text": " Today on the Matt Wall Show, desperate Democrats grasping for any reason to hate Amy Coney Barrett have now decided that her use of the term sexual preference is offensive and horrible. The entire left decided in the span of 24 hours that this term is offensive. We'll talk about the implications of living in a culture where words change meaning so quickly and also why the left's theory of sexual orientation completely contradicts their theories of gender. So that's that we'll discuss all of that. Also five headlines including a new Biden ad reaching out to black voters that is without exaggeration the most patronizing and degrading political ad I think I've ever seen and will play it for you and in our daily cancellation the NBA is canceled not just by me this is a decision we all have made and for good reason I think so we'll discuss that to all that coming up but first let's talk about light stream now I think many of us can say that we have interest rates that on our credit cards that are higher than we prefer we carry the balance on the cards and we're losing money by the second with the interest rates that's why you need light stream light stream offers credit card consolidation loans with five from 5.95% APR with auto pay and excellent credit the rate is fixed so it will never go up over the life of the loan and the application is 100% online you don't have to leave your house you don't have to put on pants it's great you can get a loan from five thousand dollars to a hundred thousand dollars and there are absolutely no fees. Look I think debt is a problem for a lot of us and I've seen it really prevent people from moving on with their lives and careers don't let that happen to you there's no reason for it my listeners can save even more with an additional interest rate discount the only way to get this discount is to go to lightstream.com slash Walsh l i g h t s t r e a m dot com slash Walsh subject to credit approval rate includes 0.5% auto pay discount lowest rate requires excellent credit terms and conditions apply and offers are subject to change without notice visit lightstream.com slash Walsh for more information. Well you know it's immensely tempting to say that Democrat senators questioning Amy Coney Barrett during her confirmation hearings this week are engaging in quite a lot of mansplaining. The condescension is there the unnecessary long-winded lectures the interruptions they're even using poster boards and other visual aids to get their points across. The only reason I won't call any of this mansplaining is that the term is vapid and stupid and used on used unironically only by people whose minds have been warped by politics and ideology still by the left's rules applied equitably as they like to say it must be concluded that Barrett's inquisitors are sexist bullies even the women who are apparently infected with internalized misogyny or some such nonsense but if the meaning and application of mansplaining changes according to the political needs of the moment at least the word is contrived and meaningless from the start the left invented that term I suppose they could do whatever they want with it the far more disturbing thing is to witness how real words words that existed before our era of woke politics are now redefined with rapid speed on the fly and with coordinated efficiency the hearings have provided us with perhaps the most glaring and most striking example of the left's language manipulation scheme that we've seen yet and we talked about the the game they're playing with the term court packing already but this is this is way worse than that so on Tuesday morning as you ate your breakfast burrito the term sexual preference was perfectly normal perfectly acceptable perfectly common and if you used it anywhere everyone would know what you meant and almost nobody would think to be offended by it by bedtime as you crawled beneath your covers sexual preference had become an unspeakable slur in the span of 18 hours this new meaning have been adopted by the media politicians even the dictionary itself anyone who wasn't paying attention to the news on wednesday will no doubt use this newly minted gay slur at some point in the future and be utterly baffled and horrified by the looks and breathless chastisements that follow that of course is part of the plan so how did this happen during the course of the confirmation hearings early on Tuesday Amy Cody Barrett responded to a question about gay rights and she said that she would quote never discriminate on the basis of sexual preference here she is in her own words listen and I do want to be clear that I have never discriminated on the basis of sexual preference and would not ever discriminate on the basis of sexual preference you know like racism I think discrimination is abhorrent gasp shocking well not really to most observers this seems like a totally normal statement hardly noteworthy but some on the left sensing that Barrett would give them few opportunities to be offended decided to make do with what they had so leftist twitter accounts began setting the stage claiming that the judge's use of the term sexual preference is somehow abhorrent all of a sudden it wasn't before it is now Kyle Griffin an MSMSMBC producer with almost a million followers was early on the bandwagon tweeting sexual preference a term used by justice Barrett is offensive and outdated the term implies sexuality is a choice it is not news organization should not repeat justice Barrett's words without providing that important context various others join the chorus eventually they seem to have attracted the attention of senator macy harono who leapt into action that evening harono circled back to scold Barrett calling her choice of language offensive and outdated repeating kyle griffin's tweet verbatim she then explained that only quote anti-lgbtq activists use the term because they want to suggest that sexual orientations of choice when in fact says harono it is a key part of an individual is identity individual's identity and it is she says immutable listen this morning senator feinstein asked you a question about the supreme court's 2015 decision in oborca fell the hot hodges the case in which the court recognized the constitutional right to same six marriage and i was disappointed that you wouldn't give a direct answer and whether you're agreed with the majority in that case or if you instead agree with your mentor justice kalia that no such right exists in the constitution so even though you didn't give a direct answer i think your response did uh speak volumes not once but twice you use the term sexual preference to describe those in the lgbtq community and let me make clear sexual preference is an offensive and outdated term it is used by anti-lgbtq activists to suggest that sexual orientation is a choice it is not sexual orientation is a key part of a person's identity that sexual orientation is both a normal expression of human sexuality and immutable was a key part of the majority's opinion in oborca fell which by the way scalia agree with so if it is your view that sexual orientation is merely a preference as you noted then the lgbtq community should be rightly concerned whether you would uphold their constitutional right to marry and then expectedly cori booger never missing an opportunity to grandstand also jumped in to register his objection to the term judge bared five years ago this re-court ruled that the constitution protects the rights of same-sex couples to marry uh this was a bergal case which has been discussed today the court declared the constitution grants lgbtq americans equal dignity in the eyes of the law hundreds of thousands of couples have built their lives on this decision i've married some of them myself on that day five years ago the court fulfilled really that ideal of equal justice under law um and yet now the same sex marriage is legal we've seen efforts to try to undermine that decision justice ginsburg wrote about legal rules that would quote create two kinds of marriage full marriage and skim milk marriage i firmly believe that our laws shouldn't allow discrimination against people on the basis of who they are i have a number of questions on this topic if i can get through them but i wanted to offer you a further opportunity to address the issue that i don't think you got to fully address that my colleague brought up when you did use the term sexual preference earlier today rather than sexual orientation is there a difference and what is it senator i really and using that word did not mean to imply that i think that you know um that it's a matter not a matter of that it's not an immutable characteristic or that it's solely a matter of preference i honestly did not mean any offense or to make any statement by that but what you just said you understand about that immutable characteristic in other words that one's uh sexuality is not a preference it is who they are is that what you're saying senator i'm saying i was not trying to make any comment on it i fully respect all the rights of the lgbt community a booger file is an important precedent of the court i reject any kind of discrimination on any sort of faces and then it was off to the races slate jesebel vox other outlets all join the dog pile publishing articles condemning sexual preference as offensive degrading bigoted a dog whistle we must say orientation not preference they all suddenly agreed our sexuality is is not a preference uh it is ingrained it is fundamental it is an unchangeable part of our essence as human beings and to cap it all off websters online dictionary changed its definition of the word preference at the end of the night to note that it is offensive what applied to sexuality now of course dictionary definitions change to reflect evolving meanings and common usages and that's fine but the usage and meaning of preference has not evolved the left to include now the dictionary is not merely noting a change in common usage but trying to affect a change by pretending that his that it has already occurred words evolve gradually and organically over many years changes in language in our society are rather than gradual and organic sudden artificial orchestrated ideological and this is a very different sort of thing now it's probably no use to point this out but many of the people and and media outlets lambasting barits for her use of sexual preference have themselves uttered or written it many times over the years the advocate for example blasted the anti-LGBTQ plus language only two weeks after publishing an article that makes uncritical use of that same term slate professed to be so alarmed by barits language after years of using the exact same language in its articles indeed just this year slates advice column featured a question from a 65 year old straight man wondering if his quote sexual preference may have changed over time as as he finds himself fantasizing about men and he decided to write slate about this the response from slate writer rich uh jus we act certainly does not sound consistent with sexual orientation as an immutable characteristic this is what he says quote from slate some people keep evolving sexually finding different things they're into at different times in an episode of netflix's sex explained fantasies are compared to language research suggests we don't unlearn old ones but we can learn new ones doctor just in lay mill miller who has studied fantasies extensively okay suggests that one way of picking up new sexual interests would be exposure via porn for example to something novel went on the brink of orgasm for many that's when the disgust response is reduced the ensuing orgasm could prompt the stimulus to be sought again and a new fantasy slash kink is is born okay that's slate evolving sexually new sexual interests a new fantasy is born this makes sexual orientation sound an awful lot like a preference that can be changed and in many cases does change there are many real-world examples of this happening slate itself provided one of them sexual orientation is immutable is dogma impotently asserting itself against the reality that clearly contradicts and disproves it besides there is an inescapable logical problem for adherence to left wing gender theory who also claim sexual orientation as ingrained and unchangeable the problem is that their their gender theories cannot coexist with their theory of sexual orientation these are mutually exclusive propositions for reasons that should be obvious take the example of a gay man who transitions into a woman if he is really a woman now he is no longer gay thus sexual orientation can change if you must always be gay because orientation is immutable he must always be a man there is no way around this without undermining or denying his self identity somewhere along the timeline in order to make both propositions work you must point to this individual and say that he was wrong about being gay or wrong about being a man or he's wrong about being a woman now but that is to claim that it's possible for a person to be wrong about their own self identity which would cause the whole artifice of left wing gender theory to collapse the scheme doesn't work if outsiders are able to judge a person's identity as incorrect based on our own logical or physical observations this is a problem that cannot be overcome though it can be blithely ignored the advantage after all to being a relativist is that you get to invent your own truth to suit the moment different moments call for different truths the relativist feels no need to maintain any common logical thread from one moment to the next now you may say that this is also the hallmark of insanity and you would be correct but insanity as we have discovered is our culture is most powerful political ideology let's get to our five headlines you know nothing beats a good comfortable sofa as far as i'm concerned you this is our argument i have with my wife all the time because she when it comes to sofas a lot of times she's looking for a style over comfort and my point is you know it's really more of a comfort thing it doesn't matter what the what the sofa looks like we have to sit in it we're not looking at it it's got to be comfortable well what if you could have both what if you could have a a sofa that looks great it is also very comfortable that's where um all form comes in you know if you've been listening to the show for a while you've probably heard me talk about helix mattress which which helix mattresses are or you know you want to talk about style and comfort very very comfortable well helix has left the bedroom and started making sofa they've uh sofas they've just launched a new company called all form and they're already making the best sofas we've ever seen or or sat on so what makes it all form sofo really cool for starters it's the easiest way you can customize a sofa using premium materials and at a fraction of the cost of traditional sofas you can pick your fabric the sofa color the color of the leg sofasize you can shape everything to your exact specifications they've got armchairs and love seats all the way up to an eight seat sectional so there's something there for everyone all form sofas are also delivered directly to your home with fast free shipping you know in the past if you want to order a sofa it could take weeks or even months to arrive and you would need someone to come and assemble a thing for you at your house i've been through that before it's not fun all form takes just three or seven days to arrive in the mail and you can assemble it yourself in a few minutes no tools needed it's just that simple um this is and the other thing if you go to the all form website which i've been on very easy to navigate and you just you put yourself it's a lot of fun you put put together the sofa you want and you can have one that looks great and is real comfortable to sit in if getting a sofa without trying trying it in store sounds a little risky you don't need to worry you get a hundred days to decide if you want to keep it i think that's enough time uh that's more than three months and if you don't love it which i think you will anyway but if you don't love it they'll pick

slash walsh and all formers offering 20 percent off all orders for our listeners if you go now all form dot com slash walsh okay um where are we let's find our headlines here if i can let's see okay good big report here in the daily wire says new we published emails allegedly show that democrat presidential candidate uh joe biden's son hunter biden leveraged his relationship with his father then vice president biden to increase his pay at Ukrainian gas company barisma the email comes from a laptop computer that was dropped off at a computer repair store last april in biden's homestate of delaware the person who brought the laptop in the store never paid for service never retrieved the device federal law enforcement officials reportedly seized the laptop in december after the store owner alerted them to it um but not before the store owner made a copy of the hard drive the new york post which was given a copy of the hard drive on sunday reported quote hunter biden discussed leveraging his connection to his father in a bid to boost his pay from a ukraine and national gas natural gas company uh in a lengthy memo to his then business partner the vent de von archer who already sat on barisma board biden repeatedly mentioned my guy while apparently referring to then vice president joe biden under president brock obama the elder biden was the point person for us policy towards ukraine and held a press conference there with prime minister the prime minister on april 22nd um and that goes into the specific you could read the the the new york post report but it goes into uh some of the examples of quoting quoting from these alleged emails sounds to me like i don't know a massive scandal but the deflating thing is that political scandals are of course meaningless if they aren't reported for this to do any damage against biden it would need to be reported by more than just fox news and the new york post um and us it would need to be reported in the mass media which it won't be of course so you want to talk about influencing elections while the mainstream media refusing to cover massive scandals when they pertain to one particular candidate that is certainly one way to influence influence an election and that is also most of the time the essence of fake news i say this all the time fake news is is usually not inventing stories that's that's not generally how fake news works fake news is in the stories they choose not to cover it's in pretending that something isn't news that's the fake news part most of the time all right joe biden is continuing his outreach to black voters and it as is often the case when white democrats reach out to black voters the results are pretty patronizing um and he you have to just hear this to believe it this is the biden ad on his youtube page featuring two guys having a rap battle where they discuss joe biden's policies in the rap battle take a listen yo why you ain't been answering your phone you know why i'm calling you you have to vote you know why i don't vote because as a black man i just feel like there's no hope our president telling people to go back to china taking the coronavirus as a joke and that's the part that frightened me when you choose a president it's supposed to be a knockout then why this situation doesn't entice in me if you got the answers to get me out this dark path my brother enlighten me we always telling each other to stay woke that's why this time we got our use our voice and you have to vote the fact that show biden has a plan for african-americans we're not dealing with your average joe i see the way you looking right now you know exactly what's going on with this for four years we had trumpin office and we made the most of it but we finally got somebody that could be in office that could give us a chance to have home ownership i'm talking to all of you 640 billion dollars over the course of ten years so we could finally get house and that's affordable okay a couple of things here first of all you have here in this ad two black men on a basketball court having a conversation through wrapping if this isn't the most stereotypical and insulting political ad we've seen in decades i don't know what is what what what would you what earns that title if not what you just heard right there second um you know maybe beside the point but the freestyle most of what you just heard there didn't even rhyme so he says uh but we finally got somebody that could be in office that can finally give us the chance to have home ownership i'm talking to all of you 640 billion dollars over the course of ten years so we finally get housing that's affordable that's not does a rhyme that's isn't a rap supposed to rhyme if you don't have music and uh if there's no background music and it doesn't rhyme then that's just nor that's just speaking all you're you're speaking is what you're doing you're just speaking with hand gestures so i mean by i guess i'm i freestyle all the time i guess i freestyle at my house to my wife i already took the trash out please stop asking me that was my freestyle i just uh i dropped a bar right there as the kids say is that what you do you drop the bars spit the bar how's it go i don't know uh so that that's man that's that's great that's we've done the cringe challenge before try to get through that whole video that's like four minutes i think the whole thing i played 30 seconds of it so see if you can get through the whole four minutes it's difficult all right um boycott nbc is currently trending uh it's we've got another boycott going and the reason is even dumber than than you think the reasons are always dumb for boycotts most of the time uh but this the reason is that they're boycotting nbc the left is because they're having uh nbc is having a town hall with trump which will run opposite of a different town hall on abc with biden and so that's the reason for the boycott this is bad because well the reason the real reason it's bad is because it involves trump and so that's why it's bad but the reason they're giving is that um if if you do both town halls at the same time people won't be able to watch both and so this is really a form of voter suppression because voters are not able to inform themselves because you got both town halls going on at the same time and that's a reason to uh to boycott yeah well the problem is for one thing who the hell actually wants to watch either of these town halls let alone both of them who would willingly sit and watch a politicians town hall for fun and second point do not have dvr is there anybody left in america who doesn't have the capability to digitally record programming and even if you don't don't you have the internet you can if you're boycotting if you're if you're hashtag boycott nbc you probably have the internet you can go on and find the the clip of it later and watch if you really want to so obviously a very stupid reason for a boycott number four uh more big news here oreo is uh defeating discrimination by releasing a rainbow colored cookie i feel like they've done this before maybe i'm wrong but either way remarkable just uh all you can do is marvel at the courage and boldness to have this rainbow colored cookie and the good thing is whatever distracts them from making more double stuffed Oreos you know like that's good to me if they focus their energy on making the the rainbow Oreos instead of the double stuffed um i i consider that a win because double stuffed Oreos are disgusting and i say that as a loyal Oreo eater going back decades the problem with the double stuffed Oreo is that you know when when you have that much of the cream you start to realize that the cream is not really cream it's some sort of hideous synthetic goop it's really the same problem with the quarter powder mcdonald's i think like the big mac is great because it's mostly just bread and and uh and the the sauce with two little slivers of of would be meat but then you get the bigger cut of the meat and it becomes obvious that this is not meat but rather salty greasy styrofoam so it really becomes too much of a good thing why are we talking about this i forget oh yeah rainbow colored Oreos so there you go five finally um more big news and innovation almost as impressive as the rainbow colored Oreo the iphone 12 uh was unveiled yesterday moment we've been waiting for here it is you can look at it right here uh spinning around and and dancing for you so there it is so it's it's you know you look at that you think well it's a lot like the iphone 11 and the iphone 10 and the iphone 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 very similar to that except this time with more cameras this is all they're doing now with the iphones i guess they're just they've run out of ideas they they just add new cameras each time every every successive iphone from now on there's just another camera they add on the thing is pockmarked with cameras at this point and uh all of this camera technology only so that narcissists can take clearer pictures of their own ugly faces that's all anybody uses it for anyway pretty soon it's going to be you know like pretty soon it's just gonna it's going to be just a camera i think that that's where we're headed that the phones we're gonna we're sort of transitioning back we're going full circle and by the iphone 20 it'll be just a polaroid camera dancing around there on the screen for you personally i would like a phone here's my crazy idea um i would like a phone that's a phone and also has the internet i like the internet part of it so just a phone with the internet that's all i need i don't need anything else and and also this would be the advantage you don't have any of the other technology uh then it it also maybe will have a battery that lasts more than 14 seconds that's my dream that's what i'm waiting for because the problem is that with all this new technology added you need more power so that so that now you have to like plug your iphone directly into the core of the earth in order to get a charge that lasts even you know a few hours so that's what i would like to see battery life internet phone text message that's all i need i'm a simple man okay we're gonna get to our daily cancellation in just a second but first we've been telling you about uh daily wires old glory baseball bat which is back if you haven't gotten yours yet you got to do that this is our limited edition handcrafted custom painted baseball bat emblazoned with the daily wire logo and since we relaunched on monday they've almost sold out again today is the last day they'll be available so you can still get yours if you hurry text the keyword baseball to 83400 to purchase your bat today all right time for our daily cancellation so today i'm canceling the nba um well i'm not really canceling them or it isn't just me this is a democratic cancellation we have canceled the nba together i i think for me i'm just sort of a typical case probably i never qualified as a die hard mba fan to begin with but i did enjoy the sport and typically became more invested during the playoffs i loved watching the mba finals especially and had missed probably very few mba finals in the past decade or so i never had a home team but i rooted for my favorite players i had followed uh labron james's career in particular since his first stint with the cleaver cavaliers but i didn't watch a single minute of this past mba season which just concluded labron and the lakers won the trophy on sunday i didn't realize the game was even happening or that the lakers were up in the series i didn't know anything about it i found out the next day due to the viral footage of lakers fans rioting and celebration because again apparently revelers celebrating a basketball team's victory are immune to covid just like blm activists and attendees of memorial services for democrats all of them are immune very very fascinating science so this was the first mba season that i've ever ignored and i have to tell you i didn't miss it being a sports fan is like being under some sort of trance you care immensely about this thing for reasons you can't quite explain but if the spell breaks and you stop caring you'll wonder why you ever did or why you should start again so for me the the spell broke because of the mba's ceaseless political propagandizing too aggressive too wearying too irritating just too much this sort of thing may be tolerable up to a certain line i'm not sure where that line is exactly but it has surely been crossed when a league canonizes and accused rapist and serial abuser like jake oblique and its top star tries to foment more division and chaos by telling wild tales about racist cops hunting black men and nearly all the players and coaches decide to turn the national anthem into a forum for self-aggrandizing political stunts that that's you cross the line i can deal with little a little bit of politics from professional athletes but if getting smacked in the face with an ideological two by four is the price of admission i'd rather just go do something else with my time and i'm not alone according to neilson this was the lowest rated mba finals in 40 years a mere 5.6 million viewers tuned in to watch the game that i didn't know was even being played to put that in perspective double that number watched a regular season sunday football match up on the same night game six of the finals last year had three times of viewership back in the michael jordan era in the 90s the championship round would routinely draw four five six times as many viewers there's no mystery about why people are tuning out now some in the sports world have tried to rescue the mba from the consequences of its own politicizing claiming that viewership is down because of other things like covid you know uh for example yahoo sports published an article yesterday arguing that the ratings decline suffered by other professional sports leagues like the nfl and mlb prove that politics can't be the driving factor but other professional sports leagues like the nfl mlb have also engaged in political sermonizing to one degree or another if the mba is being hit especially hard it's because they've been especially loud while screeching from their soapbox besides just ask the fans why they're turning away they'll tell you there was one poll done recently has nearly 40 percent watching fewer games because of politicization and that poll separately counts uh the fans who've switched off because of the mba's dealings with china so china hypocrisy and political posturing which are two very interconnected issues together account for almost 60 percent of fans these are not small numbers and this is not a small problem for the mba now it's probably true that covid isn't helping matters uh the absence of fans does tend to make the games less exciting even without all the social justice stuff but covid the election the riots all of the other unpleasant and worrisome subjects dominating the news are major reasons why so many americans would like to turn to sports for an escape and major reasons why we have little interest in our sports escapism being served to us with a side of left wing moralizing it's like it's like you know going to chucky cheese as a child only to be told that you can't jump in the ball pit or go on the jungle gym until you complete your multiplication tables and finish a plate of brussel sprouts you know chucky cheese exists precisely to be a place where multiplication tables and brussel sprouts don't exist you have defeated the purpose by combining these two universes now granted that may not be the best analogy because vegetables and mathematics are good for you even if you don't like them BLM talking points on the other hand promoted so relentlessly by the mba are not good or true or healthy or helpful in any way it's just that when we turn on the news or we enter into a political debate with someone we're prepared to encounter and engage with that kind of rhetoric they're part of the bargain they should not be need not be part of the sports bargain which makes our tolerance in that setting much lower we would rather sit and watch the game enjoy the sport for its own sake focus on a fun and frivolous and pointless thing for a while and that's it and if that's too much to ask so be it we'll turn the TV off and turn our energies elsewhere and you know it's probably for the best on second thought so the mba is uh really just canceled as i said i'm i'm not doing it they've they've just been canceled and it honestly is like a trance because once once once you just say okay i don't want to watch this anymore and then you look back and you think what why was i even watching to begin with in what way is my light you know my life now without watching the mba playoffs especially in what way has it been harmed is my life am i my worse off now without this am i like no i'm not in fact i just have more time to do other things of course i end up wasting that time too but still i can waste it in other potentially more fruitful ways so that's why the mba is canceled and that's going to do it for us today thanks for watching everybody thanks
