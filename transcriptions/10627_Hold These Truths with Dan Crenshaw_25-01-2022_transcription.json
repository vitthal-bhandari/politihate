    "text": " We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created. Because a member of Congress, I get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office. Experts on what they're talking about. This is the podcast for insights into the issues. China, bioterrorism, Medicare for all, in-depth discussions. Breaking it down into simple terms. We hold. We hold these truths. We hold these truths with Dan Crenshaw. Welcome back everybody. We are going to have a really interesting show today. I have Cara Dansky with us and who describes yourself as a radical feminist or just a feminist. I don't know. Either's fine. But thanks for having me either way. Yeah. Well, tell us about your shirt. You wore a shirt today. And there's a bit of a story behind that. So let's start with that. Yeah. So my shirt says woman, noun, adult human female. And the story behind it is that somewhat surprisingly, this is a controversial thing to say. So there's a woman in the UK. Her name is Kelly J. Keene. She's got a YouTube channel. And I hope everyone checks her out because you'll probably love her. She's great. And in 2018, she put up a billboard in the city of Liverpool that simply said woman, noun, adult human female. And a man named Adrian Harrop thought that that was quite controversial and offensive. And he campaigned successfully to get it removed. So it was removed. Evidently, the definition of a woman is taken to be controversial. And so ever since then, she has been selling t-shirts like the one I'm wearing. She has a shop called Standing for Women, where she sells these shirts, pens, umbrellas, all sorts of stuff. And she's great. I hope everyone checks her out. It seems like the UK has this problem more so than we do. I don't know. That might just be a perception. But they also have these kind of anti-free speech laws that make this entire conversation a little bit scarier in the UK, the fact that you can take that kind of stuff down. Whereas I don't think you could legally do that in the US. You think, God, for our Constitution. It would be interesting to test that. I don't know how much our First Amendment would protect us more than the UK laws. I don't think they have this problem worse than we have it. What I do think is that their media has gotten a little bit better at talking about the issue. One problem we have here is that most mainstream media outlets simply will not discuss this issue in any sort of honest way. Yeah, and that's fair. Unless it's Fox News or something. I mean, you find you're obviously not a Republican. You're a registered Democrat, but you find yourself having to come on podcasts like this one to even talk about it. We're strange bedfellows on these issues, the sort of cross-section between feminism and conservatism, which I don't think a lot of people would have anticipated. I want to read a little bit about your background so the audience knows some more about you. You are a public speaker writer, consultant. You've committed to protecting the rights, privacy, and safety in women and girls on the basis of sex. You've recently written a book, The Abolition of Sex, The Transgender Agenda, Arms, Women and Girls. You are president of the US chapter of Women's Declaration International, which seeks to promote the Declaration of Women's Sex-Based Rights. Your senior counsel at the ACLU for Center for Justice, which advocates for a transformation of US criminal justice system and an end to mass incarceration. You also are on the steering committee of the US chapter of Women Human Rights Campaign. You're also an attorney with a JD from the University of Pennsylvania Law School and a BA from Johns Hopkins University. You've got quite a bit of experience in criminal justice law and policy. I could go on. You served as a law clerk for the honorable Martha Vasquez at the US District Court of New Mexico. You've been a public defender. You're really in the thick of this, author, activist on these things. You understand the legal implications, which is really what I want to get to. This is a kind of a wonky policy podcast in the end. That's what our listeners like to hear. I want to get into the court cases of this, but maybe 30,000 feet, the philosophy of how all this started and something you write about is how this began with the postmodernist revolution. I'm not sure a lot of people understand what that even means. The postmodernist process. Can you explain that from the beginning and how this came to be? Postmodernism popped up in the mid 20th century in academia. It has a lot to say, but at its core is the notion that reality doesn't exist and everything can be deconstructed. Out of that came what is so-called queer theory, which evolved from postmodernism to say that the sex binary doesn't exist. That I really think is the source of the lot of the problems that we're seeing today. I also just want to say, though, there's nothing about this that's theoretical or hypothetical. It is happening in reality and in law today that, for example, the Biden administration is promulgating rules throughout federal administrative law to say that sex must, by definition, include gender identity, but no one really knows exactly what that means. It is having devastating consequences for women and girls in real life. It is actually happening now. Let's jump to that. There's a couple instances that you're referring to. One is at HHS. I think these rules are promulgating. One is at HUD. These do have implications in the real world. I believe in HUD, for instance, if you see you cannot discriminate based on gender identity, well, then you think the logical implication is that, well, now you can't have female-only housing. You can't have female-only shelters, right? Is that the problem that we're seeing? Absolutely. That's happening today. There have been instances in the United States where women who are staying in domestic-violent shelters, and to be clear, the reason that women stay in domestic-violent shelters is that they are fleeing violence, most often perpetrated by men. Those shelters are not permitted to... They have to allow men to be housed there under this particular HUD rule. Now, those are all being challenged to be clear. There are 20 states have filed a lawsuit in the Eastern District of Tennessee challenging the Biden administration's orders and memos that redefine sex to include so-called gender identity. I'm very proud that my organization, the U.S. Chapter of Women's Declaration International, has filed a brief in that case in support of the states that are challenging the administration. Yeah, and that's great news. You hear anecdotes quite often too that just don't make it into the media. I personally know, say, police officers in the Maryland area because my wife's family's from there, and they've told me these stories where biological men have come in and committed very, very violent acts against women. I mean, they're very disturbed people to begin with. This is a violent person to begin with. Male or female doesn't really matter. But then putting that stronger person in the shelter and in the vicinity of women, it defies common sense at all levels. I kind of want to go back to the logic behind this, or the lack of logic, or the philosophy, or however you want to call it, this postmodernism. Because I constantly try to understand the psychology of this sort of nihilism that is occurring with the postmodernist theory. And is that what it is? Do you think nihilism is this sort of desire for the destruction of institutions around us because change must be inevitably good? I don't know. I can't figure them out. So there's a feminist in the UK named Sheila Jeffries, and she would argue that this is a men's sexual rights movement. It is hard to understand. It does defy common sense. And so when common sense people try to make sense of it, it's very difficult to do that because it does. Right. We still don't articulate it. Yeah. It defies common sense. But we have to understand, and when I say these things, I know it sounds crazy, except that I can document it, there is literally a man going by the name Princess who was convicted of raping a 12 year old girl. That landed him in prison, and he is being held in the women's prison in the state of Washington today. There's another man who was convicted of murdering three prostituted women. That is literally the crime that landed him in prison. He is being held in a women's prison in the state of Washington right now. All you have to do is say, I'm a woman. Is there no other obligation on his part to, do they have any standards at all? Is it simply identification, self-identification? In California, by law signed by Governor Newsom in 2020, the law took effect in 2021. All you have to do is submit an application and say that you have a so-called female gender identity. That application then has to be approved by prison officials, so it's not automatic. But several of those applications have been approved, and none of them have been disapproved. In the state of Washington, it's not by law. It's by administrative policy, and I'm not exactly sure exactly what the policy says. But we know from the evidence that men are just being housed in women's prisons on the basis of their so-called gender identity. You asked the question of sort of why, and I said there's a feminist named Sheila Jeffries who would argue that this is a men's sexual rights movement, and I think that she's absolutely right about that. There's another woman, a friend of mine named Jennifer Billick, who writes at something called the 11th Hour Blog, and she documents exactly how this is being fueled by a very wealthy corporate industry that is designed to destroy the material reality of biological sex in reality, in society, and in the law. Well, let's expand on that. I mean, who? I mean, who is funding? Do we have people in particular that have this crazy ideology and are trying to fuel this? Because, look, common sense Americans are just blown away by this, right? This is not popular. I think you have polling on this. It seems obvious and self-evident that it's not popular. Glenn Youngkin won in Virginia because of these kind of issues. So who is behind this, and how do we identify them and stop them? Yeah, so I mean, just on the topic of Governor Youngkin, I was in Loudoun County in October and in August, and I was proud to stand with those parents who were holding the school district to account for their nonsensical, dangerous policy of allowing boys into the bathroom knowing that a girl had been sexually assaulted by a boy in the bathroom. So I was very proud to stand with those parents in Loudoun County. So who's doing this? So there's a man whose name is Martine Rothblatt, and he was on the cover of New York Magazine a few years ago being hailed as the wealthiest female CEO in America. He's a man. He has many billions of dollars. He spent millions of dollars creating a robot replica of his wife named Bina. I'm not kidding. This is all available online. You can find out. His name is Martine Rothblatt. And he has billions of dollars and he is a huge part of this. There's another man called John Stryker, S-T-R-Y-K-E-R, who founded something called the Arcus Foundation, which has billions of dollars. John Stryker also gave the ACLU $15 million in March of 2021. That's an extraordinary amount for a one-time donation to a nonprofit. He gave $15 million to the ACLU to fund so-called LGBTQ advocacy. But almost nothing that the ACLU does today is gay rights advocacy. It is all about pushing the T and the Q on ordinary Americans. I try to make the case in my book, Getting to Your Point About Ordinary Americans. And this is true across the political spectrum. And getting back to your points about postmodernism, if the people in the ivory towers had tried to persuade ordinary Americans that the material reality of sex doesn't exist, they would have failed. So what they did is they invented a new word and that new word is transgender. And they have persuaded most Americans that the word transgender describes a coherent category of people, which is a marginalized community. But it's not true. This whole thing is being driven and funded by billionaires. As many things are. And it is kind of intuitive what you're saying because, yeah, is this some radical male sexual movement in a way? Yeah, because if you look at the consequences of it, it's like you said, richest woman CEO. You're not a woman. The fastest woman swimmer or runner, but you're not a woman. So you're undermining women's accomplishments in very, very serious ways. And there's these heartbreaking stories. I was watching Fox News yesterday and Caitlin Jenner on talking about this. And let's call her she. Caitlin says that it's so confusing. It just drives me crazy. But she's saying like I would- But it doesn't have to be. It doesn't have to be. We can all speak truth. We can. And we have to. I would argue that we have a moral obligation to simply call men he. Yeah, I agree with that. I would agree with that. For the sake of nobody blowing me up, I'll say Caitlin is very common sense about this. It says, look, I would never compete against women. Even though I have no testosterone in my body at this point, this is what I said, I have no testosterone in my body at this point that just because of the hormonal therapies that they're going through. But I had it for decades. I'm clearly stronger than everyone else. And so then you hear these heartbreaking stories of these high school girls. They only have one shot. I mean, they're only a senior on the varsity team for one time. And then some male comes in and rips it out from under them. I kind of want to go through some examples of this just for the audience because there's plenty of them. So here's one in government, right? Rachel LeVine. She's confirmed as assistant secretary of health at HHS, the first female four star admiral of the US Public Health Service Commission Corps. She's not a female. That's a male. So you just stole that from women. ACLU, I'm kind of curious under position on an ACLU because I thought you were on a part of ACLU, but you seem to be pretty critical of them as well. So I worked at the ACLU from 2012 to 2014. Okay. As you mentioned, I was senior counsel on criminal justice policy and I worked on the ACLU's campaign to end mass incarceration. And I oversaw the investigation into, and I wrote the report on police militarization. And I left the ACLU at the end of 2014 for personal reasons, not having to do with this. But today, yes, I'm very critical of the ACLU and its work to undermine the rights, privacy and safety of women and girls. I think it's pathetic. Well, here's another example of them doing that. They tweeted and edited a quote on abortion from Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the anniversary of her death, where they swapped women for person. It seems small, but it's not small, especially with somebody like Ruth Bader Ginsburg. I mean, I mean, I disagree with her, but I cannot deny how groundbreaking she is and the kind of pathbreaker that she is. And to just diminish that for women, I think, is nonsense. And then to make matters worse, when asked about it, the executive director of the ACLU said something like, well, we shouldn't have edited her quote because we don't edit quotes, but we also have to understand that there are people who seek abortions who aren't women. It's just nonsense. Yeah, it's laughable. And it's hard not to laugh at it. It's upsetting because it is actually pretty serious because, you know, in like our doctor is supposed to pretend that they see something they don't. I mean, you know, that's the other question. When you start putting these kind of regulations and HHS and things like that, it is a woman therefore, and I think this you bring this up, is a patient not allowed to request a female doctor because that could easily happen too. Is it an OBGYN doctor? You know, a lot of women don't want to see a male doctor in these kind of settings. So you're not allowed to do that anymore. The way that I read the HHS rule is that in a facility funded by the ACA or under the ACA, if a woman demands to have a female healthcare provider and a facility provides her with a male healthcare provider who claims to identify as a woman, there's nothing she can do about it. That's, yeah. And this is recent executive orders from the Biden administration. First half of 2021. We're looking at. Yeah. Yeah. And I just want to also say it is really important to laugh at this because it is lunacy. It's ridiculous. But I also just, I really want to caution listeners against dismissing this as lunacy on the left, which it is, to be clear, it is lunacy on the left, but we shouldn't dismiss it as just that. We dismiss it at our peril because it is having an impact in the lives of all of us, but especially women and girls. I certainly think it's gaining more attention. I'm less and less concerned that people are dismissing it. I mean, Texas was a bit ridiculed. Republicans in Texas were ridiculed for focusing. This was some years back. I mean, the legislative session focused a lot on the bathroom bill and everybody was like, what are you? Stop it. What are you doing? You guys are idiots. You should have focused on something else. And I think it led to losses electorally. And that might actually may have been the case back then. I don't think that's the case now. I think people have woken up to the fact that this is real. I mean, there's a very serious movement that tries to push this. We're seeing it more and more around us, of course, less in Texas of all places. But it does happen around the world. I mean, when JK Rowling gets canceled for speaking basic truths and, you know, her own Harry Potter actors are demanding her head. I mean, you're in a crazy place at this point. Yes, absolutely. But I do love that we're talking about JK Rowling. So that's nice. Oh, do you have anything? What do you want to say about her? Well, just that it was great when she published her essay in 2020, which kind of broke this all open. I really hope that we'll have an American who will do something similar. Yes, somebody you wouldn't expect it from. I mean, obviously, there's plenty of Americans. I think because people like me on my side can say it all day until we're blue in the face, it reaches plenty of people. But it's actually take voices like yours who clearly don't have some conservative agenda to make this make light of this, I think. I promise I do not have a conservative agenda. But I also will say I hear from Democrats all the time, just this morning, I had an email from a woman who said, I'm never voting Democrat again. She said, I'm a lifelong Democrat and I'm never voting Democrat again. But she also said that, you know, and this is the real difficulty for women who in positions like mine, which is we're going to end up not voting. Well, Tulsi Gabbard, I was just thinking, Tulsi Gabbard's a great example, you know, well-known figure, you know, who kind of takes these sort of heterodox positions within the left. She's a personal friend. I like her a lot in respect to her ability to just speak truth. You know, obviously we disagree on plenty of things, but on some things I think she's really powerful on. Let's get into some of the laws and court cases perhaps. Maybe we can bore listeners to death with that. Let's go with the Equality Act first. I mean, I've had to vote on this thing multiple times now. And it sounds so nice. How could you be against equality, Dan? You must be some kind of authoritarian, horrible person. And well, it's a little more complicated than that. I mean, so can you run through your, how you see the Equality Act and some of the second third order consequences associated with it? Sure. So this is a bill that would redefine the word sex to include so-called gender identity throughout federal law, throughout the Civil Rights Act, including in places of public accommodation, which is very concerning to me. The definition of gender identity that appears in the so-called Equality Act is absolutely nonsensical. It just doesn't make any sense whatsoever. It doesn't tell us anything about what is actually meant by gender identity. Just open to interpretation by anyone and therefore it can be anything. It can be anything. And it annihilates the material reality of biological sex in law. And people will ask me sometimes, well, Cara, are you in favor of racial segregation in bathrooms? Of course not. The truth is that men and women are simply different for purposes of using public bathrooms in ways that women of various racial, ethnic, and religious backgrounds are not different. And so these arguments border on the absurd. But I do just also want to clarify, women's declaration international US chapter is completely in favor of having laws that protect people on the basis of sexual orientation and protect people on the basis of nonconformity with sex stereotypes. So in 2021, we published our version, which is called the Equality for All Act, which would protect lesbians, gay men, and bisexual people on the basis of sexual orientation and would protect everyone on the basis of nonconformity with sex stereotypes. We're very much in favor of that. What we are not in favor of is redefining the word sex in US law to include the nebulous, nonsensical, vague, and completely unscientific concept of gender identity. And that makes sense. I want to ask you about non-discrimination law in general, and I can't, because that seems like a step in the right direction to trying to thread this needle, because on the one hand, you don't want these consequences that we'd already talked about, where if you just redefine sex and leave it nebulous, then again, then you have men in women's Westrooms and shelters and locker rooms, and there's obvious consequences with that. But it does, especially with the way you phrased it, you're referring to, you don't like to use the word transgender, so you phrase it as people who don't conform to gender stereotypes. We know who you're talking about when you say that. What do you think about the court cases? I can't remember which Supreme Court case it was. Was it Bostock in Clayton County? So where the biological man who was fired for requesting accommodations, as he now identified as a woman, was this the funeral home case? Yes. I'm sympathetic to the funeral home owner, because if somebody radically changes their behavior, their behavior on a day to day from one day to the next, as an employer, what am I supposed to do with that? When do we still have some kind of freedom of association? I think that's very different from race, for instance, where that is inherent in you, and that doesn't affect your behavior per se, right? That's your race. It's an intrinsic part of you. You should not be able to discriminate against that. I would say sexual orientation as well. I would also place it in that category. But behavior, if you're dressing differently, if you're now acting differently, and especially in a place as sensitive as a funeral home, isn't there something to be said for that? And the last thing I'll say to the context behind my thoughts here is under the Trump administration, their policy for transgenderism, I thought, was quite good. It said, if you identify as transgender, you can be in the military. But you have to act as though you are your biological sex. If you want to tell me that on your off time that you were Sam, but now you're Sally, that's fine. I go have do your thing. When you come here, your haircut still has to be the same because it's military regulations. Your uniform still has to be the same. Military regulations. You don't get to then go do the physical standards of a woman just because you're identifying as a woman. No, you're still doing your run times in nine minutes, buddy. And that's, I think that's a healthy way to do it. I think it's the best way you can thread the needle. What are your thoughts on what I just said? Well, I mean, I guess at the end of the day, my concern is for the protection of women and girls on the basis of sex. And I think a lot of this stuff is just kind of made up nonsense. In the Bostock case, the funeral home case that you're referring to concerned a man named Amy Stevens. And it was coupled, the Supreme Court joined it with two other cases that concerned gay men who I think it was undisputed had been fired on the basis of their sexual orientation. And I wish the court had not done that. I agree. I think those are very separate things. And when the court joined those cases, that spelled, I think, the end for women and girls under Title VII. We have to be very clear because the Biden administration is obscuring this. The decision in Bostock was limited to Title VII. It concerns only employment law, but the Biden administration is now extending its logic to housing, as you said, housing to prisons. The Biden administration recently announced that the Bureau of Prisons is going to be housing men in women's prisons federally. Cheers. I extended to the HHS context, all the things we've already talked about. But I just wanted to clarify, the Bostock decision, as bad as it was, and as much as I don't like it, it was limited to the employment context. And that's being obscured all over the place. Did you agree with my reasoning on it? I mean, the way I think through that, or what am I getting wrong? I think we agree that we don't like the Bostock case. Right. Well, in terms of what you're getting wrong, I don't know that you're getting anything wrong. It's just that if a person wants to sort of go and, well, I guess what I want to say is this, people who don't conform to sex stereotypes, that doesn't magically make them part of something called transgender. So for example, Price Waterhouse was a decision from the 1980s where a woman named Anne Hopkins was punished in her place of employment because she refused to conform to the sex stereotypes of traditional femininity. She didn't like to wear high heels. She didn't like to wear makeup. She had short hair. And she was punished for that in her place of employment. People told her that she was too masculine. She used too many swear words. She wasn't feminine enough. And the Supreme Court ended up deciding, rightly, in my opinion, that you can't do that. You can't discriminate against people because they don't conform to the stereotypes of masculinity or femininity. But what it didn't do, because it was the 1980s, it didn't say that Anne Hopkins was transgender just because she refused to conform to the stereotypes of femininity. That's what we've got now, unfortunately. It's just when you're trying to create policy for such a question, it seems obvious that she was discriminated against unfairly because she's dressed as a little differently. But what if she was dressing in these weird drag queen outfits and disrupting the workplace in such a way? You're saying should employers have the ability to... Yeah. And that's why I focus on the word behavior. When your behavior changes radically, but you say it's because of your... Well, I'm not conforming to a gender stereotype, so I'm dressing like this weird drag queen creature thing and telling stories to children or whatever. Where is it employer to do? And are we just at this point right now because of this court case that you just can't do anything about it? I mean, so one of the biggest problems with the court case, the Bostock decision, is that it's said that people have the right to be protected on the basis of their transgender status, but it didn't tell us what that means. Literally, it just didn't tell us what that might mean. So does that prohibit an employer from discriminating against a person who wants to dress in drag and read stories to children? I don't know. That hasn't been tested in the courts yet, but just so your listeners know, that's a real thing. That's a real thing that people are dealing with. Public libraries all over the country are hosting so-called drag queen story hours where men dress in drag and read stories to children. It's just so inappropriate. I mean, it's really inappropriate. I don't know, and why are parents taking their kids to this? I don't know what... You're so open-minded sometimes that everything just falls out and it loses all the senses of decency. It happened even in Houston. I think we had this problem. There was a big outcry against it. I might have stopped because of it, but it's just strange. I've seen other disturbing videos where adults are bringing in drag queens to children's events and you see children and they're dancing with the kids and the kids are horrified. They're not into this. This isn't fun. This isn't learning about diversity. It's not learning about acceptance. It's trying to normalize pretty fringe behavior that a child's mind is just not ready for. Well, it is. I agree with you 100 percent except for the fact that our children are starting to be taught this in schools. I've read curriculum from Washington State that's being taught to five-year-olds. Kindergarteners are being taught that you can either be a girl or a boy. You can just decide. Or maybe you think you're a boy, but you're actually a girl or something like that. Children are really being manipulated and lied to. Even though I agree with you that children are not comfortable with what's going on, I worry that they will become more comfortable with it because adults are teaching them that it's acceptable and that it's appropriate. I really do worry because we do have to understand our children in public schools are being lied to about the material reality of biological sex. Back to boarding court cases because these do have an effect on obviously what we're talking about. Maybe you could walk us through these and tell us where we're at in the country on single sex bathrooms. There's the Gloucester County School Board versus Grimm. There's this dough versus Boyerton area school district that hit these questions. There's the Sol versus Connecticut Association of Schools, Hecox versus Little, BJP versus West Virginia State. Much of these all center around bathrooms. But can we go over these? Maybe this will help illuminate where we're at in law in case precedent at this point. Yeah. Grimm concerns a female high school student who identifies as male claims to who the school district had a policy that said you can either use the girls bathroom or you can use this private bathroom which is in a different location in the school. And Grimm didn't like that and filed a lawsuit represented by the ACLU challenging the school district's policy. The case is very confusing in terms of its procedural history. I believe that Grimm initially lost and appealed and lost again and tried to get to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court kicked it back. And in the meantime we had a change of administration which changed the Title IX rules. The procedural history of Grimm is very confusing. But at the end of the day, Grimm won. And the Supreme Court declined to take up the matter which means that in the Fourth Circuit it's unlawful to discriminate on the basis of someone's so-called gender identity. So Boyer Town is very different. In Boyer Town the school district announced a policy of letting anyone access any bathroom on the basis of their so-called gender identity. And a group of kids made up of some girls and some boys sued and said we don't like that. We want to have opposite sex bathrooms. And they lost and they appealed and they lost before the Third Circuit. In the course of which there were oral arguments in which one of the sitting judges on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals admonished the student's lawyer not to use the phrase opposite sex because he was worried that the phrase opposite sex would confuse matters. And sometimes when I write about this I like to point out somehow in 2015 in the Obergefell decision the Supreme Court managed to use the phrase opposite sex without confusion. People are actually not confused about this. Anyway so that's- No one is confused. No one is confused except for this particular judge in the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. So that's Boyer Town. The sole case is pending before the Second Circuit right now. This is a case where four girls sued a state athletic association because the athletic association permitted boys to compete on the girls track team. And so the girls sued the state athletic association. And that case is pending before the Second Circuit to decide whether the case has become moot because the boys who had been competing have graduated. So we're waiting to hear what the Second Circuit thinks about that. Keycox versus Little is a case that comes out of Idaho which has a law in place signed by the governor that protects women's sports on the basis of sex. And a young man named Lindsay, Keycox, sued the state on that basis. And that case is also awaiting a determination to determine whether that case is moot because Lindsay has dropped out of college. So that's currently pending before the District Court for the District of Idaho to make some factual determinations about whether the case is moot. And I think Texas just voted on a similar bill. I believe Texas voted on a bill to save women's sports. I think that that is true and Governor Abbott signed it. I think it is also true that it only goes through high school. It doesn't protect women's collegiate athletics. I think I could be wrong about that. I think that's the case. I have to look. I mean, but from everything you just described, it seems like a lot of bad news where, you know, where do we stand right now if the courts have become this radicalized? It's just amazing to me how such a small minority can influence such great change and force people into very obscene accommodations. I think that's part of the challenge here is that Americans across the political spectrum have been persuaded that there is a small minority of people who do have this power. But I think that's really the wrong framing. It's not that there's a small minority of marginalized people who are accomplishing all of this. It really is a top down money driven corporate driven enterprise. There is no such small minority of people. Now, if you're talking about the small minority of people who have differences of sexual development, sometimes referred to as intersex, that's a different thing. There are people who have chromosomal makeups that are different from the typical XX or XY. That is true. There is that group of people. But that's not what we're talking about here. Those people have their own political battle. And that's not what we're talking about when we're talking about what I use in the title of my book, the transgender agenda. It's a very different thing. Yeah. No, and I understand that. I think what I mean is, you know, in this day and age, you're at a company and everybody in that company is just normal people, but they're also terrified of being called misogynists or bigots on Twitter or whatever. And there's two people that make a big stink about the bathrooms and they will immediately cave to it. I think that's the phenomenon that that's what I meant by how small minorities can affect such great change. And I think Americans are susceptible to it because we have a long history of that where minority rights, you know, we're Americans, right? But we've been fighting for this for a long time, for the rights of women, for the, you know, for freeing the slaves. There's a long history in this country of giving people their rights. And I think the transgender movement has wrapped themselves up into that very successfully and made people scared to speak out against, obviously there's a limit to this. And the limit seems pretty obvious. You cannot grant somebody rights that infringe on the rights of someone else. That's not rights in a classical sense. That's effectively what's happening. Yes, that's what's being demanded, except that there is no coherent category of people. Which makes it even more confusing. Yeah. And I do understand, I understand that Americans are under tremendous, tremendous social pressure to go along with this. And you know, I know a woman who was a Democrat. She's a radical feminist and she was a Democrat. She's very politically active. She went to her state party leadership. She said, I have some real concerns about gender identity. I'd like to talk with you about. They said, we're not interested in your views. She said, fine, you don't want my vote. You won't have it. She quit the Democratic Party. She registered as a Republican. She invited me to join a meeting of the Republican women in her city, which is a fairly major US city. And I did and I was happy to do that. And so I'm meeting with this group of Republican women. And one of them said, Kara, what are we going to do about the issue of transgender athletes in women's sports? And I said, okay, let's talk about that. But first, what do you mean by transgender athletes? And she paused and she said, I thought I had to say that. And I said, well, do you mean men and boys? And she said, yeah. And I said, okay, well, we can just say that then. And she said, I didn't think we were allowed to say that. So and I, and I, and I credit her. That's a Republican woman. And even she felt so much pressure to conform to the language that she was scared. To speak the truth. And so I'm really glad that we had that conversation. But I really just feel like across the political spectrum, we've got to stop caving to the language. Like we've just got to stop doing it. We just have to be able to speak the truth about the reality of biological sex. It becomes this like 1984 or well in new speech. Yes, it does. It's it's very strange. Very much. You go a long list of things that look like that. I'm sort of the woke speak that that has occurred in society. Heck, I'm even seeing it on the right a little bit in sort of different ways. But it's it's it's not good. We need to get back to seeking truth. Well, you know, if I may, in March of 2021, the Senate Judiciary Committee had a hearing on the so-called equality act, which we were talking about. And is in his introductory remarks, Senator Grassley referred to transgender athletes. And it's so frustrating to me to watch Republicans who are not my allies. But when prominent and very powerful Republicans use the language of the opposition, it's frustrating. Yeah. And I see your point. It kind of gives them what they want. I think we just sort of the probably didn't think that through. We don't think that through very much and very much detail. But to your point, I think you have to. It was interesting about the equality act. I remember it was getting debated the first time around back when we actually did debates on the floor and we could do motions to recommit. And the Democrats got rid of those. So there is no debate and there's no there's no moment where we can sort of publicly disagree anymore on the floor. It's actually it's actually a really bad procedural move. I think Republicans should probably bring it back. But the I'll never forget because we were making these arguments that if the equality act will result in men and women's sports. That was our big argument. And of course, we're right. And I thought that the Democrats were going to get up there and say, no, you're misreading it. It won't do that. They try to play some smoke and mirrors legally with the language. It's not what they did at all, actually. They fully admitted that it would result in that. And I forget the member. She's gone now. She was the one that had the scandal from California. But she got up there. And I guess she was probably collegiate athlete or something. And she said, we don't need your help protecting our sports. We'll be fine. And it's like, how dare you? Because that's not true. It's not true. An MMA fighter who's getting their butt kicked by a man, she does need help. She does need your help. And she does need your protection because this is really this is now it's borderline dangerous. I mean, I've I don't know if you heard of that case in particular, it's a little old, but there's concussions involved. There's actual bodily damage being done here. Yes. His name is Valen Fox and he broke the skull of a woman named Tamika Brents. Yes. You know, exactly. What? It's almost like you're an expert in this. But, you know, I do want to say when when this was being discussed in the House Judiciary Committee, I think it was 2019, a friend of mine named Julia Beck testified, she was invited to testify by a Republican. She herself is a radical feminist, lesbian, Democrat. And she spoke in opposition to the Equality Act before the House Judiciary Committee. And you know, it was interesting. I watched the footage of her testimony. She pleaded with House Democrats to vote no on the Equality Act. And all of the men just glared at her, glared at her. And none of the women on the Democratic side would look her in the eye. Geez, that's awful. Well, we make strange bedfellows, I suppose. It's the movement of radical feminist lesbians and conservatives. Right. Welcome to the fold. I like your battle ax earrings, by the way. I wouldn't mess with you. Those are pretty cool. Thanks. Kara, thanks so much for being on. This has been a really great discussion. Thanks for having me. I appreciate it. Of course. Where can people find you? Twitter, Instagram. Twitter at kdansky. My website is karudansky.com. And please visit women's declaration USA.com where you can find the declaration on women's sex-based rights. We invite everyone who's aligned with our movement to protect the sex-based rights of women and girls to sign the declaration. Great. Well, this has been great. Really informative. Thank you. Thanks."
