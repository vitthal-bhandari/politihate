    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blazetv.com slash The Blind. Today, consumer costs continue to rise and hey, the $3.5 trillion spending bill has not even been passed yet. I can't wait for that to happen. And also, Joe Biden on a much much more related note, Joe Biden apparently is losing America's trust according to the new polls. We will get into all that and much, much more. And it all starts right now. Hey, happy Friday. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez. Today joined. I know it is a Friday show. You are not expecting to see him, but he is here live in the flesh. Super gear host of Stu does America. Thank God it's Friday, Sarah. Yes, I love Friday so much. So joined once again by Yaku Buyan's host of the Yaku Buyan show also a Blaist TV contributor, also wearing a very cool shirt. Thank you for asking. Get the shirt. Yaku winds dot com. Get the shirt when you do you help us literally rescue children from sex trafficking? And this is part of the problem. Did you come up with that yourself? Sort of. Well, we have people. Okay, well, I was going to say that it's a very creative. I was involved. Poor. No, I'm not going to take poor. No, poor. No, yeah, poor. No, please get the shirt. Come on. Yes, Yaku Buyan start. Yes. Yaku Buyan start. Yes. Yaku Buyan start. But they have to know we have to know how to spell your name together. Hey, he's the O. B O O Y E N S dot com. Good question. It's just easy. Well, it's one of the most common questions that I get is how do you spell Yaku's name again? It's good to be with Stu. Good try spelling a bragir. Yeah. Yeah, it works out for everybody. So everyone just calls me Stu. Well, and I was going to say in Stu, which isn't even your real name. That's true. None of this makes any sense. I just thought when I met you the first time that your mom or grandma cooked real good Stu and you were the kid always around the kitchen. That's what it's called. What should we name him? Oh, I know. All right, let's get into the Friday headlines. So a Dollar Tree is going to they are to sell more items above a dollar. That's what they're planning to do as costs rise, just to offset the cost obviously for, you know, the range of goods of the things that they're getting and higher price points. The supply chain, obviously, we talked about that yesterday's program with Pat, how the supply chain, you know, has some kinks in it right now. And as a result, and plus inflation, tight labor market as a result, it is driving the costs upward Dollar Tree in specifically has experimented with selling items for $3 and $5 since 2019 in a shelf section labeled Dollar Tree plus. It cracks me up. It's like, no, no, no, this is the high end part of the Dollar Tree. Yeah, you are going to the designer part of the Dollar Tree when you go here. The exclusive line. Yeah. And so there those tests are going to continue in a few hundred of its roughly $7,900 tree stores. I had no idea that were so many, but they're going to include more above dollar items to respond to these rising costs. And you know, like I said, this is, this is, it's just September. And the Biden administration has actually not really done that much yet. So I can't wait. I can't wait to see what happens as we continue, you know, passing these trillion and trillion of dollar spending bills. I can't wait to go to $100 tree, which is coming soon. It's got a lot of fun. I actually was in Dollar Tree recently. It's awesome. Yeah. It's it's actually legitimately incredible. I do love going there. I cannot believe the things are a dollar that are in that place. I've never been to five below. Five below. Five below. Five below is good. Five below is awesome. There's so much stuff in there at once. If you have kids who love these guests, because they feel like they just it's amazing. It got something right. Oh, yeah. My son's always like can I have that I'm like why don't I care what it is I don't care if it lasts five minutes because you know all these toys break because actually I know that's all of it so it doesn't last but you know what on a serious note Joe Biden you know athletes fighters you have your resume so many fights wins losses whatever he can now literally say that he's the first president I said to broke the Dollar Tree and broke the Dollar Tree sad and he's supposed to be there for the the little guy exactly that's what he's breaking everything for the little guy well the left actually doesn't like Dollar Tree I found this out recently yeah because like you know there's there the other stores do like dollar general there's a couple of other ones and they had already you family dollar and they kind of already abandoned the one dollar price they had gone up a little bit already Dollar Tree was the last holdout but what I found interesting is that the left has as they always do have a thing they have a thing against Dollar Tree why because Dollar Tree has obviously for a dollar all this stuff in a big section of food and the food is like you know look it's there you know like you get your mac and cheese and there you get so it's not going to be the highest end stuff in the world but for a buck you can feed you know your kid you can feed yourself like in a really cheap way better than no food exactly yeah what's happened though according to the left is that they have come into all these neighborhoods and people see that they have really low priced food they keep buying it which is which means they don't go by all of the I guess organic like you know I don't know yeah the hippie stuff with Sarah Busy right so they don't buy all that and I guess that means they're not healthy so the point is that Dollar Tree is making these communities unhealthy and they actually have targeted dollar stores because they're selling food too inexpensively to the community do this is screwed up do I would say this okay I would say this all things unhealthy comes from the left number one at the jab in your arm and then the other thing here we go the other thing is this right fight fight I fight I'm fighting right heck I fight everything evil but here's the deal though I think they don't like Dollar Tree because it stands against entitlement programs right you can you can feed your family because they allow because you can feed your family you don't need the government to support you we don't need you we need you to to think that you can't feed yourself so right you got to come to Uncle Sam you got to get your stamps you need your you know you need your entitlement that is a great line up line up come line up to the food line right no Dollar Tree said no you can get there's so cool stuff in there you're a direct you can get yourself some Coca-Cola that's a good company but you can get some things you can get yourself some cookies and amazing things my kids love it yeah it is really fun but I mean we are this is just the beginning of this right now I mean you know sure a dollar twenty five a dollar fifty a dollar store might not be the biggest difference in the world but we're looking at real supply chain problems but look at percentage increase when you go from a dollar to dollar twenty five that's a twenty five percent increase it does make it does make a difference to us just to a lot of people and it's hitting them not just the Dollar Tree but everywhere they're looking you know one of the weird things that's going on in China right now is because of covid they had issues with power generation so they set power limits across the country and then they what's happening is the places that do all the manufacturing in China are over shooting their limits so they are going to they're doing things like shutting down once a day doing rolling blackouts all the things that it's like California they're doing all those things and they're unable to produce in the amounts that they believed they were going to be able to at the beginning of the year so the demand is coming back with the economy coming back China is you know not able to actually keep the power on at these factories that's going to create more and more shortages I I the one thing if it means nothing else other than other than this think about actually doing your Christmas shopping early this year because these a lot of these toys that are usually in bountiful supply make going dry up real fast this year so if you can get out ahead of it do it yeah we were first-hand you know struggled with this my wife could her car got rear-ended by somebody and you know a seven-day job for the fixing a bumper and everybody's safe praise God right turns into a nine-week job because they can't find parts of the bumper American made vehicle I buy American right American made vehicle but the parts are manufactured in China right and so there's no parts so so nine weeks of fixing a bumper right and so yeah it's real it's passed down we're seeing it pop up all over and if you see a 25% increase at dollar tree you're gonna see a 25% increase across the board because that's how economics work well and we talked about this we kind of touched on this yesterday's program but you know it's just it's crazy to me you have Jen Psaki coming out and saying oh well businesses that are gonna you know pass that cost onto the consumers that's just unfair and absurd as if that isn't the way that it's always worked and by the way has to work if you want businesses to stay in business yeah I mean is there any surprise Jen Psaki thinks economics are absurd no no no okay actually here okay so they control room is telling you they have this club let's go ahead just for funsies let's go ahead and listen to the poor man's peppermint patty watch obviously the president's commitment remains not raising taxes for anyone making less than $400,000 a year there are some and I'm not sure if this is the case in this report who argue that in the past companies have passed on these costs to consumers I'm not sure if that's the argument being made in this report we feel that that's unfair and absurd and the American people would not stand for that but I will take a closer look at this report and get you a more substantive response such attitude I love that that's her thing I don't know if you've ever noticed it's the it's the little brush the hair behind the ear then the it's like the hey you yeah hi you I'm going to lie to you and behavioral science those are her signals the telltale giveaway said okay she's in uncomfortable waters right yeah uncomfortable look we got a president that says $300,000 is free why would they think that you're gonna pass down cost to the consumer yeah it's gonna cost zero the three point no it's just an illusion when you see that there's $3.5 trillion here included in the spending package it's it actually cost zero dollars because that's how math works yeah when you are able to say you know what you know what cost is zero dollars is a bill that's larger than the entire GDP of India yes that is zero dollars that is I mean like when you have that sort of freedom it's just I marvel at that at this administration because they think you are so dumb yes like they think you are the dumbest human being below sub-human level intelligence yeah I mean to go on and say these things like they're out there saying well you know the guy the guy in the horse we know the border guard wow that was horrific when the photographer himself has come out and said the thing didn't happen 3.5 trillion dollars is zero dollars they just saying these things like that not even a child would be able to decipher in seconds and they just keep doing it because they know the people they're looking at and trying to reach are so incredibly stupid and they're right about half the country aren't they yeah the fact that half the country buys this nonsense proves the right they're right still we can't we can't argue that any longer we can't all right because it's on our watch as a population we said yesterday when the American people step up and say enough is enough there's action they just never do so why would you someone asked me I can't believe these people are so evil I say they're a godless people why are we surprised that they're gonna be evil right why would it evil evil has no bounds evil doesn't stop at three trillion dollars it'll go to ten trillion dollars there's no there's no govern there's no bumper rails when you roll this just go it's a highway yeah well that's just one to remain a guy for means to know one pushes back yeah so many problems on the left come from the absence of a limiting principle right there's nothing that can stop this and it's funny because the debt ceiling acts as a pseudo limiting principle we all know it's BS yeah but at least they have to address it every couple of years and now they're talking about just getting rid of it completely because honestly it just becomes this stupid show where we're just like they're thinking why are we still talking about this debt ceiling oh my they're sitting around going why are we still working with budgets yeah it's just and you just print more duh yeah that's true you just more of it always print more which is funny coming from the environmental this document came out yesterday and then we're kind of a little bit off the topic but I think it comes to the spending Friday right so you have three point five they wanted six trillion right and then AOC and all that we're like oh we are already we're already bending so much for you we only want three point five trillion now we have this document that came out yesterday where Joe Manchin now we know he was on record giving Chuck Schumer a number of what it was one point five trillion dollars and they're you know of course the Democrats like this is absurd one point five trillion dollars is crazy it would be like the third largest spending bill in the history of the United States and it's like that's the moderate Democrat coming out with his crazy number right and the only ones that pass it are a Joe Biden bill and another COVID bill yeah I mean this is just so crazy and the amount of spending you know it gets to a point where inflation is going to get out of control yes we're gonna feel it it's gonna we're all gonna get hit hard we're gonna see the supply chain problems we're gonna see the inflation but there is that trigger there's that tipping point to go to the back to the Malcolm Gladwell concept it hits that point and then it's out of control it happened in Zimbabwe it happened in Argentina it happened in Germany it's happened all over the world we really don't want to hit that point and everything that conservatives have worried have complained about for years and years and years about how we keep spending and spending and spending has come to fruition here in the last two years between COVID and Biden those two things combined are the horror show that conservatives always worried about and we're about to see how bad and ugly the Scots my my concern with it is in 2008 it was a controlled market right it was the housing market that caused a collapse right now it's not a market it's the mark everything it's everything yeah and so when that goes oh that's an avalanche I mean it's I don't know how you recover that is Zimbabwe that is me standing at an ATM in Zimbabwe personally and no money comes out of the machine because there's no money there's no money if the inflation is through the ceiling and and by the way just as we wrap up this segment I just would like to point out you heard Jen Psaki say you know they keep throwing around the $400,000 amount again remember first they said people making $4,000 then they said well what we meant were families making $400,000 not not peace so you may see your taxes increase if you're if your combined income is $400,000 now they're shifting that again to just well people making $400,000 I'm sure you will hear once again as this goes through and they have to figure out a way to pay for it well what we meant was a combined total of $400,000 and actually we overshot that so if you make more than 50,000 years is it the gender confusion definition of people or actual the term people which one people who knows these days all right we've got more to come first we want to thank our sponsor Bonner Wine so if you enjoy a glass or just a

off right now not just off the wine but also off of the shipping all right that is Calgirlwine2021.com I want to get to Biden apparently is losing America's trust in the latest polls but just kind of I feel like this is kind of intertwined with this other story that I'd like to get to which is Hunter Biden still appears to own 10 percent steak in a Chinese government linked firm that has invested in company sanctioned by the United States and again this is despite how many times have we heard from the president or from the White House that his family would not have any foreign business ties and also from again the poor man's peppermint patty that we heard from earlier Jen Psaki who has repeatedly said Hunter Biden was in the process of getting rid of that ownership stake in the company well I look I know they're really not great at math but it's it was January and now it's September and that is month one two month nine so we have gone nine months now and he still owns that 10% steak I you know call me cynical but I feel like he was never planning to actually take himself out of that Chinese firm I don't know I just it's that's just me being very cynical no history no repeated patterns of behavior that I'm drawing that conclusion from of course no not at all not at all that this is about to get a lot uglier for for this family sadly because there are multiple people and I can I know Peter Schweizer is one of them who have this laptop who I can't wait I mean and they're going through multiple email accounts that they've been given access all above board but you know one of the best researchers in America is Peter Schweizer him having actually for our security I you know what I Peter Schweizer will not kill himself that I will say because this he's planning on you know really coming out with a big expose on this I know I think at the beginning of the year and what we're finding as they're going through these documents and emails and everything else is this is not a hunter Biden story this is a Joe Biden story it's a bit family story the money flows we all know about the big guy but it's more than that it goes deeper than that and you know I was reading the this you know I read these books so you don't have to the peril with Bob Woodward and Robert Costa that came out and you know they go through one of the sections when he's trying to figure out whether to run for president and a big part of his consideration was hunter like I mean he's out of control what do we do they go through like one of the interventions they tried to hold and at times you you can feel bad for Biden knowing his family situation his wife died his other kid died Bob Biden died and and now you know hunter Biden lives like a maniac right I mean like as a father I can't imagine what that must be like but the prop the proper way to handle that is not to try to protect him correct from his criminal activity correct you can not try to protect him from every terrible decision he's made I mean if they would have let him slide into this day and into these bad areas a little bit and feel the consequences of it maybe it wouldn't have ended up this way unfortunately they they have gone out of their way to to allow hunter to use his influence to make his life a lot better and and get lots and lots of money and you know escape all sorts of negative consequences that's made hunters life worse and it's about to make Joe's life worse because the things he's done I think are going to come out to bite him by the way if I may quickly mention if you want to get the ultimate merchandise item related to hunter Biden you need hunter Biden laptop case dot com hunter Biden laptop case dot com it's as cool as a is Yakos shirt but it's so pretty cool look I'll say this thank yes I please get the shirt but I'll say thank you there it is that is so funny if you have your left there you go there you go well if my concern is if you have that in Starbucks you're gonna try to take it conservative is gonna snatch it go I got it or that's a ploy from the left to just confuse a whole lot of people you know well look you got to a you know FBI raids your house and they avoid taking the laptop yeah yeah I spoke to him when that happened you know Mayor Giuliani look here's the deal they did not give the Trump children a minute to disassociate with foreign business practices right they made Ivanka pull her clothing line far less oh come on they made her pull her clothing line out of department stores they shut things down the Trump organization hurt for four years when the president was not and junior couldn't be there and you know help Eric and help the red look they didn't give him a minute right and you can't even stew you me can travel to a country that sanctioned by the US but hunter Biden can have ownership in nationally government owned businesses but as an American if you travel to a nonce to a sanctioned US country you're gonna get stopped at entry you're gonna get interrogated you can't I'm sure you could lose your passport but the the president's son can have affairs and what's also gonna come up which is you know particularly important to me is his nefarious sexual activity outside of our border that breaks a slew of US laws which he should pay for here because he is in fact an American citizen so I agree with you it's gonna get really hot in the kitchen right but no the Trump children did not get a minute to disassociate from business and financially get get hurt for the sake of serving the American people right but this dude can run around right and play big play big leagues with China it is really interesting to see how the media can shape the entire narrative just by saying that the story was false at the beginning of it yeah and then once they once they're like oh actually by the way this whole story was true everyone seems to forget about it because there were some really damning things you bring up the the child issue look he had some text messages that came out that anyone else you're right you're right right and and I mean multiple issues and everyone just kind of glossed over it because they told us the New York Post was somehow lying and now all of a sudden we hear oh actually that was those those documents those text messages all of that was legit but it's like everyone's forgotten about it by now it's amazing how that works it really is I'm like hello like we remember we do this for a living but I just feel like there's just maybe you know you beat the American population over the head with a stick for so long they just they're like yeah oh I don't just make it stop make it stop hurting I don't remember what happened they banned the Twitter account of the nation's oldest news group yeah yeah yeah and it was real and it was real the whole time I mean I remember hearing the story initially like we he left it at a brick repair store like I totally believed it was a real laptop but the the initial story I was like that it seems a little shady like well how do they get this thing they got it at the store like like Hunter is this what that's you know he's that dumb he was high as a guy yeah yeah he was right and I think that's you know that this there's so many of these loose ends he's has not been able to cover himself and that's why we have Hunter Biden left up case dot com yeah I mean I just feel like it's a moment of brilliance thank you very much thank you very much I feel it does feel like the type of thing that would would cause a good conversation if you haven't have it on your laptop so it's true I love that all right so let's get to the latest polls after the break for someone to thank our sponsor built bar so if you maybe you're like me and you just you

one you like the most you can go to built.com use promo code news 15 you'll say 15% off of your order over at built that's B U I L T dot com promo code news 15 all right let's go over these latest polls because I you know I think it it may show that there are some voters who may have voted for Joe Biden who may be regretting their decision right now definitely Biden fatigue I think we can say is officially a thing so only 45% of Americans view Biden as a strong leader this is down from a height of 49% in October last year this is Fox News polling by the way 53% of Americans do not be the president as a strong leader recent Gallup polling from last week shows that Americans are not happy with the president the majority of Americans disapprove of Biden with his approval rating hitting an administration low of 43% a Pew Research Center poll published last week also illustrated a shrinking approval rating for the president which plummeted from 55% in just July to 44% in September those of you who don't math that's an 11 point decline and according to this same Pew data only 43 only 43% of Americans believe that Biden is quote mentally sharp which is down 11 points from March of this year which I'm shocked that he got 54% in March yeah I'm margin of error and that was 55% but like that's an amazing one I mean at first you know look his it's it's been mentally sharp mentally sharp it's incredible that anyone thinks he's mentally sharp I don't see how anyone can think even if you like him right he's mentally sharp it's interesting his polling is is weird because you know we just came off the president Trump's four years where President Trump never had a great approval rating is very consistent though probably the most consistent approval rating we've seen in a president I think in a ball time and and this is something that's happened in polling over over decades where because we kind of become more polarized people have a little bit more of a locked-in audience like you know the range isn't as wide I mean you used to see you know people like George H.W. Bush hit 80% and 20% approval rating in two years you know that doesn't really happen all that much anymore President Trump was basically between 47 and 38 his entire presidency and it bounced around you love him or you hate him but with the one thing with Trump was he could have shot people on Fifth Avenue and not dropped below 38 he had a really high floor of really dedicated supporters that would never go anywhere Joe Biden does not have that he does he does not have that he has people who don't like him but he has very few people who like him people don't have any passion for Joe Biden Joe Biden's only characteristic that hasn't been the White House is his name is not Donald Trump so yes there are people who don't like Trump and that there are that was the cases entire presidency a locked-in group at the top saying I hate him locked in group on the other side saying I love him but with Joe Biden the bottom is zero like it depends if it keeps going like this he's gonna he's gonna dream of the days he was back at 38% approval the the independence will turn on him and they already have in large numbers and you will start seeing Democrats turn on him too when it just went when he's giving them a bad name when that Afghanistan was the real big one I think we've seen glimmers of that with that point why because they'll eat their own young they are loyal to nobody but themselves and when he starts making them look bad like Nicki Minaj all of a sudden oh Tom West Kanye West they will sacrifice their own second Rihanna I think Rihanna shirt he was still legal think while it's still legal like oh how dare you you one of us you're not allowed to think we tell you we the great Illuminati tell you what you can and cannot think and if you dare to think for yourself we're gonna ostracize you they will ostracize him you're a hundred percent right and he's starting to make them look real bad bill Bill my heart okay you all these guys are coming saying hey I Shaquille O'Neal Shaq coming out saying I'm disassociating myself of being a celebrity I'm not with that class this is just two days ago I'm not with these folks they're not representing me you know and so this is gonna happen and then they're gonna they're gonna sacrifice him I don't know what that looks like and in dear Lord may we never know what it looks like when you have a current vice president step into a president role but it's gonna get ugly I think we plummet below 20% on this guys approval rating pretty quickly because he's gonna keep making mistakes and and then and then what happens because you mentioned early right because you mentioned earlier there is the Hunter Biden laptop it is being reviewed by the removed what happens right well I don't think they can do anything until 2022 at the very earliest they don't want to give the Senate up if you think about what would happen Kamala mood move up there then it would be a 50-50 tie with no vice president to get a new vice president prove you'd need Republicans to come on board to get a new one yeah so that would be put them in a really tough position I don't think I honestly outside of him having some massive health problem that they can't cover up I mean to the point of like if he was just asleep all day in his office they just got yeah I think that's like legit they pull a larger Wilson and just like prop them up and you know hey sorry he's he can't make it yeah it would be we get a Bernie style so I don't think until 2022 I think if he's that if it continues to go this way you'll get to a point where I think they really consider him making an early announcement I'm not running for real and it lived in Johnson situation I'm not running for reelection and then they'll go into that next phase where perhaps it's Kamala perhaps it's someone else but they'll start moving in that direction that's a position they don't want to be in and I don't think they will be in it unless like there's a difference between him spending three point five trillion dollars and the result of that being inflation like crazy or locking in really liberal policies they'll sit through a lot of that yeah what they don't want to sit through is in competence and you know like they are fine pulling all the troops out of Afghanistan they don't care about that at all but they look so terrible in the way they did it it was indefensible and you keep having situations like that and there's been several of them so far I mean that you know I was like it's the worst but September only nine months this guy's broken stuff in nine months remember steers another I was about to say the border as bad as it is maybe a gift because he can't stop it they don't know how they don't know how they can't stop it I'm telling you they opened the floodgates and they broke the valve they they don't know how to close it that people are coming yeah and it's gonna make him look so bad because bad things are going to happen unfortunately that's what's gonna say a gift but at what cost how many thousands of illegal immigrants are going to be illegal immigrants right coming through the roof right but but again now we get back to me and in biblical times you know there is no awakening without persecution there is no revolution without force you know it gets really bad and so it's it's revolution time by the way America the hint is but it's gonna get really really trying to get me kicked off of YouTube no I'm not I'm just me I'm sorry I apologize you know I'm kidding but but but but the deal is just for me I have a really hard time living life going let's take another shot let's take another shot let's take another shot I'm like good Lord it's time to throw punches I mean it's time to and legally of course right right legally not we have the Constitution we have the legal standing on these things we do we just don't execute them you know yeah still that's right on that it look we're at a point where the pressure is building and I think you know everyone's at each other's throats all the time and you know it is a it's it's we're in that point where it feels like these divides are almost impossible to heal I mean I how many times do you see people saying you know what we should just give up let's just break into two countries it's like that look the United States of America I like it here I want it to become I like I wanted to improve I want to return yeah exactly we do have a way I mean look if we all we need to do is go back to the basics here right we have a constitutional framework that works it took us from you know the 1700s to this massive superpower where we're doing all sorts of incredible things here all the time we've ripped billions of people out of poverty over the past 20 years this is not something you want to throw away and at some point we need to realize we need to become we need to show some gratitude to what this country is and what it's done and the people start you know who are constantly trying to tear it apart need to be called out for what they're doing because we lose this we lose it all yeah you're making me get a bromance with you because I'm an immigrant for you not know how good it is here they don't so bad somewhere else yes they don't they don't I mean I have no perspective they do not have the perspective that you do which is why so many immigrants legal immigrants who did it the right way who came here who loved America so much that they wanted to come here and do it the right way that's why they are you guys are like the most patriotic people that I've that I've ever met which is it's sad for Americans who were born here all right we got to take a break we'll be back I mean it really like it's not even close yeah it's not even close yeah yeah teachers at Leander independent school district this is north of Austin here in Texas of all places received a training presentation last year in October that instructed them to discuss gender identity with students and also ask them whether it was okay to share the students preferred pronouns with their parents this was a training called I already know I know I'm gonna call on you first he's like chomping at the bit ready to go I'm sure you already know all about this it's called supporting LGBTQ plus youth in schools and as led by two school social workers working for the district Felix Barnhart and Monica Kelly who describes herself as a fat positive sex positive therapist so that's definitely a person you want working with your children it says add your pronouns wherever your name is published and then also whenever you are introducing yourself just to normalize the sharing of pronouns let students identify themselves on the first day of class with their individual name and pronouns and make sure to inform substitute teachers of these pronouns you don't want the substitute misgendering them and there's a place on the form that they give to the students it says may I use these pronouns when I contact home in this form that they had the students fill out and then another follow-up would you like to follow up with me in a private conversation about your pronouns because that's not creepy at all and could lead to other things and they say that's because well a student might be out at school but not out to their parents so we just want to keep them in this safe space I have a feeling the acubuience here I'm gonna really really try to keep you on the air I know you go you you do it you go for it so I'm so royally pissed right now I maybe shouldn't even talk this is the proverbial definition of child abuse child indoctrination you're taking a kid that's normal and you're making him think whether he's not you're making him question you're forcing him or her to question well am I the weird one for being normal right and that is evil that is evil intent you've got the Episcopal School of Dallas a Christian school for parents out there if this isn't your school again this is why I say fight starting with this nonsense right it's now in the Christian community now yep a hundred percent a hundred percent this is now entering church and Christian schools are now saying we're so woke we're just gonna make the kids all just normalized what's normal this is not normal this is a fragment of society that thinks this way that we are changing culture we're changing language for these people and this is how you lose your nation you change language you can't lose a nation you know or move a nation without changing language which is why Hollywood is so so powerful right they're changing language they take the normal kit who knows he's a boy and they make him go home at five six seven and question well am I weird am I can I and that you are they ask a normal question like a boy says hey mom can I try on your shoes or hey can I can I wear your makeup and they're just like oh you must oh you're super imposing you know yeah right yeah yeah these are the mothers that never should have been mothers right this is the mothers that need some serious deep therapy right because they had trauma they were sexually abused something happened in the past and now they're gonna vicariously push it on their child as we saw with James you know a friend of the in Dallas the case or it's just the trendy thing to do right now it's just trendy why because they get attention and this is why these school boards are carrying because they're getting attention it's a popularity contest and the collateral damage is a whole generation of children even the ones that can weather the storm and and still go now I am a boy are in a tumble dryer today they're up there I don't know quite know what's right what's not that's flat-out evil man yeah there's nothing they can depend on you know and there's there's just nothing to depend on to your point now yeah go this is happening all across the world and in changing the language is a huge part of it I recommend Michael Knowles book that just came out I don't know a month or two ago called speechless he goes through all the history of how these how people have used changing language to change societies it's frightening and it's real and it can happen anywhere it really can and it's happening here I honestly met the point where I think you know public schools are lost I mean I mean I don't even yes I mean you're right you got a fight if you're kids in there you got to do everything you can to do the given the best experience possible but like there was a time where maybe public schools made sense and I think we're past that time but but until we can not have our tax dollars go to that yeah I'm like I'm still fighting for it no of course look we're still paying for it every ever exactly look not everybody can go to private school I mean if you can it's a great idea I think and but as you mentioned it's not even a hundred percent there even in private schools even in Christian school try having to watch it all yeah the time we have to be I mean you really need a new full-time job I have a friend who is who homeschooled all of his kids and and I remember thinking to myself like I just like not something I could do I could do right like I did it for a year like oh right yeah you know and it's not it's not for everybody there's some but there's something that everybody can do yes even if it's just you know trying to do adding on and just keeping constant contact with that teacher and the and the curriculum and doing everything you can but I think we're we need to get the school choice thing is real it should happen it should have happened a long time ago it should have been probably the top outside of just like okay they've shut all our businesses down covid should have driven the Republican Party and conservatives in particular to push hard to get something like school choice put together so that we you know you know I you know my kids went back to school on August 13th 2020 you know that was not the case for a lot of my friends and their kids isn't it incredible to hear nationwide I'm like oh my god people weren't going to school like the entire school year pretty much the entire school year yeah crazy crazy and what's it gonna do to these kids you know you have to be able to take your tax dollars out of that system and push them somewhere else and you know we've always we've always been saying that there's never been a better example than covid to prove it covid plus CRT is the path to to educational freedom for our kids and we we need to focus on that a lot more I think and Trump was but the GOP didn't support him they didn't actually step up and say school choice and so again I'm well I think they said like they people said it they said it but we didn't see the right give us some some action give us some summary I think too though a lot of it has to come from not from the federal level you know I think because you know he didn't have enough power to get it done anyway he didn't have enough senators and everything you could this stuff can be done at the state level yes and happy yeah all right we got to take a very cool feedback a first-coupled school of Dallas I want to read this is this is it all right it is Friday which means I get to read hate mail that my producer puts in there
