    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucksxton show podcast Welcome back in our number three clay Travis bucksxton show encourage you to go subscribe to the podcast We love all of you on our nearly 500 stations nationwide, but We understand maybe you were traveling for easter. We hope all of you had a fantastic easter weekend Maybe you are just going to be on the road for spring or as we move into summer vacation time Maybe you're going to be chilling on the beach. Maybe you're like bucksxton you get really annoyed with the audio People are playing their music too loud. You just want to put your earbuds in and listen to us and relax Go subscribe to the podcast Somebody on the plane last night was having a oh What happened? Don't even get don't even get me started speaker phone conversation We had to wait on the tarmac for a while speaker phone like she got her speaker phone in front of her She's like yeah blah blah talking like you know you're in a you're in a and like we're packed in here like sardines in a little People are just barbarians clay. I don't know what to say you're an old man to still be relatively young Um, but I will say in defense of speaker phone conversations Sometimes those phones it's almost impossible to and by the only one it's almost impossible to hear On some of these phones it feels like the sound quality of the phone if you have You know a smartphone Because most people don't really use the phones to make that many calls anymore Like how many people do you call on a regular basis book like an actual legitimate conversation versus text Actually call the talk to on the phone less than six Yeah, so and I feel like almost everybody is texting and everything else So I think they've let the quality of actually being able to speak on a phone Vanish and so the reason i'm bringing this up is I will go speaker phone a lot of times Even if i'm walking in a public venue because otherwise I can't really hear what somebody's saying now It's not like i'm having an in-depth conversation about you know Important things in my life or something, but it's like hey to the kids need to get picked up Hey, what's going on with uh, what's going on with the dinner dinner plans or something like that So maybe some small measure Of that the speaker phone was having to occur because it couldn't work, but in general I would say just text all these plans Update We get told you breaking news. Uh, they have identified the shooter. He was an employee of the luival um bank If you're just getting in your car there were four people killed Eight wounded. Uh, the shooter was also killed And it sounds like the guy had a death wish and he was suicidal And he decided just kind of snapped 25 year old shooter In luival that is the update on that story so far as it goes Um, but I mentioned that and I don't know how many people are paying attention to this buck But if you look at what Gavin Newsom is doing and let me go ahead and close out by the way Subscribe to the podcast clay travis buck sexton tens of millions of downloads every single Uh, a month you can get all sorts of brand new awesome content there as well Join the cool kids. We love all of you listening live But also you can listen to the podcast and you can listen like laura travis my wife does at two x speed And we sound like we're doing micro machines ads, but we get done really really fast and my son Who is 15 has stepped it up to another level He said he sometimes listens to the show at three x speed because he does high school debate And they have to talk so fast that he's used to that so You can get through the flow get through the show and pick up a lot of different Uh, glean a lot of information really rapidly if that is the way that you want to consume him We love you no matter how you're consuming now Gavin Newsom Who it's worth mentioning Did you know buck that ron des santis one in florida By more than gavin new sum did in california That's a pretty staggering state. I haven't heard very many people make reference to it florida was one by ron des santis By 19 samad percent he won his state By more than gavin new sum won the state of california so we think about california as kind of like this blue utopia Oh, there's so many people out there that are far left wing Des santis in florida was more popular in 2022 Than new sum was in california that's pretty pretty crazy But gavin new sum has started this tour around red states because let's be honest He is setting the table To be the front runner for the 2028 Presidential nomination and also buck i'll be honest with you I think gavin new sum is just trying to keep his name out there in the event that something happens with joe biden Joe biden still has not announced He could have some sort of health condition over the next couple of years And I think joe biden wants his name Uh, sorry gavin new sum wants his name floating in the event that something like that could happen But he's not just weighing in on things about his own perspective He's actually criticizing ron des santis and maybe this is an early setup for 2028 Uh, he is now going around saying that des santis shouldn't run for president because he hasn't been that good of a governor And I don't know who is out there requesting all of these commentaries But let's listen to this is governor gavin new sum trying to give advice in terms of campaign Look for ron des santis. What is his political path here? Should he be running away from criticizing trump? Should he be speaking up for the rule of law? He's going to get rolled by trump trump's just going to roll him Thumped I honestly if I were offering him political advice I'd tell him to pack up and and wait a few years And actually do some of the hard work which actually includes governing not just identity and culture war I'd expand medicaid Now the backs of folks out there that need preventative care I'd be focusing on the acuity of the environment mother nature. She bats last bats a thousand I hope he would start to focus on some of those issues that would be my advice come back As a more seasoned and capable leader with a little humility He's delusional. It's a note. I actually think would be amazing for Both entertainment purposes as in it'd be fantastic just to watch Um and and really important for the country to see I'm not even talking about elections or trump or desantis or anything else or gavin new some stepping in To have a a serious debate right now, you know a lincoln douglas styles what I did in in high school Right. That was my I was a lincoln douglas debater. That's what they called it Uh, were you were as all the badasses were let's be honest between you I'm not debating and me doing civil war sleepaway camp We were two of the badest asses in uh in america back in the day Some kids in high school were quarterback of the football team. We're like all standing lacrosse. Did you wear a top back Top hat What did you wear a top hat like the aber No, you were a top hat I don't know. I mean, maybe there was that's a lincoln douglas style Maybe that's the thing you did but i'm just saying we were we were badass lincoln douglas debaters Oh, that's right when it came for summary remarks at the end who people better watch out but But I know everyone's just they're like they're like our sons are not gonna be as nerdy as you guys That's fine. That's fine um aranda santis Gavin Newsom debate on state governance in america would be Incredible. I mean, I agree and and you know, I don't know You could find someone to moderate it on equal now you could say why why would they do this? I mean first of all Why wouldn't they do this because their respective sides you would assume would want to see this? I would love to see it because What what what it would force Is someone like avenue simp to have to account for why is everyone leaving your state? Yeah, every every member of the media. I mean of course the california media is a joke, right? But every member you know the journalists that worked for the la times and stuff like that the san francisco chronicle Um, they should be asking every time what are you gonna do to get people to stop leaving? Because that is an even more powerful vote in a sense that how people cast their ballots Is where they choose to live in a post-covid america? I really believe that So florida has more people moving to it than any state in the country and more people moving than at any point in its history California has the opposite situation more people leaving and they're not leaving because they think it's so awesome in california Right that doesn't make any sense. Obviously they think california is deteriorating. I would love to hear the explanations I would love to hear the breakdown from the left of why this is happening um because As you look at this clay, you know, there was another Uh, you know, we talked about the cash app founder of obley was stabbed to death in san francisco You know the xan francisco fire commissioner was just beaten bloody and hospitalized with a crowbar by a lunatic That just happened over the weekend. I mean this stuff just keeps happening in california That's what we need and and to build on your people leaving california argument since covid started 700 000 people have left california and 800 000 people have moved to florida So that is to me the ultimate referendum on whether people appreciate and respect your governance buck every year since california became a state in 1850 all the way up to 2020 california gained population 2020 2021 As I just mentioned hundreds of thousands of people have suddenly left It's never occurred before in the history of the state of california This to me is the If if we could wave a magic wand and we could just have a match up that to me Directly addresses so many of the issues that arose out of covid in this country It would be desantis versus Desantis versus gavin nousam Because I would love to hear gavin nousam try to justify masking I would love to hear him try to justify arresting paddle borders off the coast Pulling and filling up skate parks with sand I think desantis could really make the case against gavin nousam and how much he got wrong And how much desantis got right and I just keep coming back because i'm writing my new books going to be out in august And I just edited this section over the weekend buck. I spent most of the weekend Uh that I wasn't with my family working on editing the book The fact that there still hasn't been a reckoning I am furious That democrats got everything wrong on covid And really not one democrat has lost their job as a result Did you say I think I sent it to you this morning? There's a school in if the good york and david zweig Who is he's a democrat? Obviously based on working for the new york times and he's pretty much told us I think he came on the show once and said I don't really you know We don't agree on politics but we agree on this because it's reality It's truth when it came to masking Uh, and he's been brave on the issue I'll give him credit because he's gone against his core audience Which is what people are unwilling to do no matter how crazy it is There is a school here. I got to pull up the name of it in upstate new york Um that Is it's a private school, but it is requiring here we go. This is called the the title of the article is Uh, the school that couldn't quit covid. This is by david zweig from the free press And this the Elizabeth and clune montessori school of ithica couple hundred students clay They still to this day everybody as we speak to you require children to be masked and separated outdoors at lunch No talking allowed That is the school's policy. It is child abuse. There should be people arrested who run that school I'm glad you bring that up because I wanted to give it the exact opposite of that I want to give a shout out to this school in miami. There was a great article about them in the wall street journal Uh, the the school is the sintner academy And they were one of the very first places to not require kids to have To wear masks and they found out something really interesting buck and it is I think all of you out there They have three primary goals zero covid policy meaning they don't require anything to change because of covid No critical race theory And they say we have a young men's restroom and a young women's restroom We don't allow anybody to pick the restroom. They're going to use Uh, and they said something interesting. I was just reading this over the weekend Um, what they found they get they got criticized to the high heavens for not requiring masks. They were a hundred percent right. They had cameras showing up every day Uh, they said when they put all those policies in place They allowed teachers to leave they said the ultimate result was a more harmonious school Uh, they said The sintner says the parents and administrators and teachers that were not fully aligned with us ran for the fences But were instantly immediately replaced by families literally moving from all over the world And they said really interesting. He said I don't know why But this is a quote from him forced masks forced vaccines CRT It's the same bundle of parents The ones that are against all of that flooded the school They have so many new students And I think this is the example of how when you get things right you should be rewarded So while that ridiculous school in new york should be rightly ridiculed The sintner school down sintner academy down in miami Good for them. I read about this kind of school i'd like to have my kids in if i were living in miami absolutely The biden white house may go down as being the most pro-abortion administration in history So how do we protect the unborn lives being lost every day?

It wasn't to meet with the families of the victim of the trans terrorists who murdered Six people at that school in nashville. No, she went to nashville to stand in solidarity with the two lawmakers who were expelled from a nashville Um, i'm sorry of the tennessee state legislature And here she is talking about this play 24 On a serious note clay just real quick Because we're going to talk about the unserious parts of kamala harris and as a as a speaker Um They haven't released the manifesto Biden did not go The media now does not want to talk about it It is very clear to me based on the evidence We had that this was a trans terrorist who was pushed at least in part By the rhetoric of the democrat party around the genocide against trans people So just remember that everybody wouldn't go to meet with the families of the children who were murdered But we'll go because a couple of lawmakers Got lost their jobs temporarily Basically for breaking the rules of the body that they were elected to And uh, but the good news about kamala harris is i think they should just deploy kamala harris all over the country to talk about All kinds of issues for democrats because she is just instant Oh my god, make it stop when she starts trying to connect with people as a nashvillean buck the fact that she showed up in nashville And did not meet with any of the victims of this shooting And instead went to make a directly partisan political play On behalf of a couple of guys that are going to immediately by and large return to the tennessee legislature Is indefensible and it's part and parcel. I told you this when the show happened. I said Uh, when this shooting happened joe biden will not come to nashville because it's a trans shooter He hasn't been here kamala came she did meet with the family She just tried to ridicule the decision made by the tennessee legislature My glendale and his team at my pillow meeting the demands are one of the largest cells ever They've discounted the price of their very popular my slippers 150 slippers now.

The audience knows without me answering what the answer to that is All right, so zero minutes for buck. I bet a huge percentage of our audience watched at least one minute of the masters this weekend John rom one Congratulations to john rom but I wanted to bring this up because In may buck of 2021 that is over a year after covid had first arrived in the united states John rom had a six stroke lead at the memorial golf tournament On saturday that means all he had to do was come back on sunday and basically not be an unmitigated disaster And he would have won I believe it was 1.6 million dollars The pga Because he somehow tested positive for covid Required that he withdraw from the golf tournament and pulled him off the course Less than two years later. He wins the masters. So congratulations to him but I bring it up Because We cannot forget what they did to us And i'm just going to keep hammering this all the way up to 2024 Because democrats showed you who they were buck you had that great tweet that we talked about I think it was on friday that really I thought summed it up quite well covid was the ultimate test of judgment and i'm paraphrasing For anyone out there in a position of power And for the people who failed They have to be held accountable And one of the people who failed was joe biden over the weekend. They had the white house easter egg roll or whatever they call it And joe biden was with our roaker He is not yet biden has not officially announced that he's running in 2024. We're moving into april Maybe we're going to move into may I've got a theory on what's going on. I want to share it with you buck and see if you buy in at all But here is biden asked by our roaker about whether or not he's going to run Are you saying that uh that you would be uh taking part in uh our upcoming election I'll either roll an egg or being the good, you know, the guy who's pushing them out. Come on help Help her brother out Playing on running out, but we're not prepared to announce it yet. Okay Yeah All right Tell me if you buy this theory buck We're now at basically middle of april. It's actually very it's going to be late when biden announces that he's going to run again presuming that he is I think that he is waiting to announce Until there are more charges brought against trump And if you listen to congressman jim jordan, he said he thinks the department of justice is going to bring charges too If that's correct Then biden can avoid people saying hey Your department of justice is charging someone you're running against by saying hey, I haven't even fully announced yet It's a stupid fig leaf, but we know that many in the media will follow whatever direction the biden administration leads them Is there and this is my theory The reason why biden has not announced is because he wants the jack smith the oj investigation complete And he can then use as justification why he thinks it's so important to run Because donald trump is a threat to democracy and given all the charges against him. He fills compelled There's no other choice. Do you buy that theory? Why would he not announce otherwise? Here's my can I just say here's the part of it that because I see it right like it that lines up except If it wasn't biden you'd have the same criticism. He let's say gavin newson took over It's a democrat appointed deal. I think it's way less of a criticism Okay, basically you're saying this is a fig leaf that may not even cover up the you know The stuff if you get what i'm like. This is a very very thin very small big leaf It's bs. I don't know we've we've seen Larger bs carried by the by the by the administration Clay, I honestly just think at this point the whole the whole point of brag Was to break the dam and and now whatever comes trumps way is just good People it's so hard for vernder to think of it this way or to process it But the longer that we have donald trump under indictment The less outrageous to some people it will seem that there's not only that indictment but another one You know just reset your perception of what's going on here at some level. I I For look But That theory i'm just trying in my head to think why would they not have gone ahead and announced that biden's going to run Officially what do they gain by not doing it for instance de santis? You're right. He's got to get the legislation passed that would allow him to run So in theory when he announces in june or thereabouts Still there's you know six eight months until the primary season in in iowa So i think holding him up What what sounds to me more than and this now i see a little bit more of like how maybe the fig leaf is supposed to be covered Not the situation here. It's not that biden will get so much heat For taking out his chief political rival with his d oj The waiting is kind of like him lying about how oh i ran because of trump and the charlotte bill It creates a narrative of the need for re-election. Yes, that's okay I thought you're saying it was about appearing You know balanced and fair with the d oj. I don't think that's a consideration at all If they're waiting so that this can come down and biden can say i'm stability And now i have a reason for the sake of the country i have to provide this stability You need to stop this monstrosity of trump from you like that I can see as a narrative political issue sure No, they carried the water for him on charlotte's bill, which was a total lie Right the very fine people lie the idea that trump was somehow endorsing nazis It's all made up But biden actually made that a signature element of the reason why he was running and virtually right one called him on it So if he waits for these charges to come down and then says the soul of america demands that i do it I can't figure out otherwise buck. Why would they not have already announced? I mean, I don't know maybe because it keeps us all sitting around wondering if he's going to announce or not I mean it might be a simple or something like that It really doesn't know if he's going to announce that would actually make some sense to me Maybe he's got some health conditions that are even more substantial than we know of And maybe he wants kamala to be the person who gets the nomination like you could sketch that out There's no advantage right and there's probably some uh Campaign finance requirements and issues that come into play that we're not necessarily You have to really exist in that world to understand all the documentation and all the things that go into it Um, you know, look he just wants He wants hunter biden to be able to sell as many 50 000 Fingar paintings as he can in peace before he Decides that he's going to run for reelection, right? I mean he wants to I think just continue with status quo as long as he can before he Is talked about in in that way more it's posturing I don't really know how much it matters. The only way it really matters is if for some reason the delay is that there's an honest Possibility that he but I just I mean clay you look at us I look I had this for last week for us and I had I took some notes on it incumbent presidents Losing I mean we just had one recently so but incumbents incumbent presidents losing other than 2020 you go you go back You look at it It happens is very rare It's rare so 92 92 and 80 right in my life. We've had 1980 92 and then obviously 2020 so it's only i'm 44 now. It's happened three times in my life So, you know, it's the odds are not saying and everybody needs to pay attention to this This idea as bad as biden has been that it's going to be a cakewalk for it. No, it is going to be a nasty brutal insanely tight Election in 2024. I mean there's going to be there's going to be billions of dollars spent To try to convince in a country of 340 million people though with all the illegals coming in. I don't know what the honest population number is citizens. Yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean but there's going to be billions of dollars spent to convince The equivalent of a quarter million people or less something like that in a half a dozen states to vote differently Yep, that's what the that is what so you are talking about the the very thinnest edge of the wedge here that is going to make all the difference 156 million people voted in 2020 If 20,000 of them had changed their mind Donald Trump would be president in the right states in Wisconsin in Arizona and in Georgia So whatever that tiny pen prick is of 156 million.

Um, michael malas who's a very interesting guy Uh an anarchist, but very interesting and very red pilled Um, he joined me for conversation. That'll be out today in the podcast Tudor dixon podcast is also a part of it. So there's a lot of Uh interesting stuff going on there.

It's an early report about budweiser or bud bud light budweiser whatever is it verified Fox news is reporting. Oh it is okay. There is well I don't know that there's data directly to reflect what exactly is going on But the headline Literally that just came across the wire Uh, and by the wire, I mean my twitter feed, but it sounds cooler to say the wire Uh headline fox news and hyzer bush distributors in heartland and south Are spooked by the backlash they are seeing to the dylan molvaney pact That that is according to a report. So look I really think this is an example Of it's dixie chicks like where not only did bud light insult It's it's overall audience. I think they directly insulted the base Right. And so I think there is going to be the base bud light drinker is a You know, I would say middle class to a little bit lower middle class Dude who just enjoys beer and wants to kick back and watch games on the weekend And I think that audience when it is described as Fratty and out of touch humor I think that audience is going to be like double bird to you I'll go buy another beer because bud light is not so unique in its taste That you're going to drink a miller light or a coars light or some other Big branded light beer and feel like it tastes that much different I When I was a beer drinker before I found out I couldn't uh ingest beer, you know safely Um, I couldn't I can't really tell the difference. I don't I mean look I've made fun of wine Um and super expensive wines and I always get the wine people who are like I I can't tell the difference very much between like Super expensive wine and normal line. I bet most of you cannot either. I'm talking about expensive bottles of wine I don't think I could tell the difference if you gave and I had a lot of them to drink over the years If you gave me let's say bud light miller light coars light And stack them all in front of me and put a blindfold on I think there's almost zero chance I could tell them apart got a bunch of lines lit want to get to your calls to close us out here mic is a firearms instructor in austin texas wants to weigh in on that case of uh, Daniel perry mic. Thanks for calling in Absolutely. And once again, my name is michael cargeld owner of central texas gun works And i'm a firearms instructor and we in texas have a stinger ground law We also have a castle doctrine if someone tries to enter your vehicle tries to remove you from your vehicle tries to kill you While you're your vehicle you can use force a daily force to stop them anywhere you ever write to be As long as you're not committing the crime anything greater than class c misdemeanor You can use force a daily force to stop that person you can stay in your ground So when you see the facts of this case to you it's a no brainer on the law. There's no way there should have been a conviction No, no, there's no way at all, you know, because we have we have too many things in the law Um that protect this young man and what if what this guy is standing up? So this district attorney is trying to say that is legal in austin texas at ten o'clock at night For you to carry ar 15 where a face mask tactical gear block traffic bang on the vehicle Point a gun at someone and threaten them And that's legal that yeah That's a really by the way That's a really excellent way to frame this forever's understanding because those are all facts Everything that might just laid out those are not facts that are in dispute both sides agree to it And that is what the district attorney here is saying that you're allowed to do that if you're if you're for blm Of course you're allowed to wear you're allowed to wear tactical gear cover your face Be part of a mob bang on someone's car door surround their car And point a rifle directly at them after threatening and shouting at them And you're not allowed to defend yourself if you're a person on the receiving end of that It's outrageous paul in san antone. Oh is an attorney you want to talk about this austin texas case as well paul what you got for us Yes, sir. Absolutely real quick. I know we're running out of time The michael morton discovery act. Uh, it's about eight nine years old now Michael morton was illegally held in prison because I prosecutor knowingly withheld exculpatory evidence That prosecutor eventually went to prison himself And that spawned the michael morton discovery act that requires as a matter of law You must Give over the exculpatory evidence to the defense side Now the only thing that I would say that I was going to play devil's advocate here for the prosecutor I don't know the exact facts of this case, but Uh, the only time you're not entitled to self-defense in texas is when you provoke the difficulty in the first place In other words, you cannot provoke the difficulty then clean self-defense now. I don't believe that's what happened But that would be the only leg you could possibly stand on right? Paul just so for example if you walk up to somebody a bar and you you know you sort of like shove somebody and say hey Buddy, that's my chair and then he goes and he's gonna take a swing at you. You can't draw your sidearm and shoot it That's exactly right that would yeah, it's called provoking the difficulty that doctrine goes back to the late 1800s I've used that case for than one that makes sense practice over the last 20 years. Hey, Mike Thanks so much. I'm sorry. Uh, pardon me. Paul. Thank you so much. Paul in san antonia for calling in great call The uh, the as we always say play the expertise that this audience As as a unit has on a whole range of issues is a phenomenal. It's a phenomenal asset to the show every day There's no doubt and that's why we love to call out. Hey, if you're an expert in this particular area if you practice law if you're Anything really I mean we we have given out Basically any signifier and said hey give us a buzz if that reflects you And thankfully you guys always come through and we hope we continue to always come through with you tomorrow Scheduled to be joined by riley gains. I think what happened to her at san francisco state university is Really cutting through the noise when it comes to women being attacked for standing up for biological women You won't want to miss it. That's tomorrow. Thanks for hanging claim ball"
