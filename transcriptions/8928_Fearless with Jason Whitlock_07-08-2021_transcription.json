    "text": " Hey, what's up y'all? This is Uncle Jimmy from a fearless feature, Jason Whitlock. Y'all know who I am. The Sa-ha, the sidekick. The bodyguard for the big guy, that's me. Hey, this is the part of the show where in case you missed something over our past week, we just let you get caught up on what happened. It's kind of like the best stuff. All right, so let's get to it, OK? On Monday's show, Jason talks about Brian Stilter and Jackie Spirit comparing Donald Trump to coke leader Jim Jones. You remember that guy from the 70s, Mr. Kool-Aid? Yeah, Jason finds a way to compare those two. Check it out. Donald Trump is not Jim Jones. CNN's Brian Stilter and the rest of corporate media have far more in common with the disgraced coke leader than America's 45th president. Some of you will reject that assertion of fact because you've been programmed to hear any defense of Trump as an attack on you. Your Trump obsession blinds you from recognizing the harm of your corporate and social media obsessions. Yesterday, on Stilter's struggling television show Reliable Sources, California Democratic Congresswoman Jackie Spirit, analogized Trump and Trump supporters to Jones and his cult members who died in 1978 at a mass suicide in Jonestown, Guyana. Let's take a listen to what Spirit had to say about Trump and Jones. And you've got to remember, Spirit was shot in Guyana. She was a political aide of Leo Ryan, a congressman Leo Ryan back then. And she was in Guyana trying to board a plane to escape and was shot five times and survived. Listen to her analogy of Trump and Jones. So you look at Donald Trump, charismatic leader, who was able to continue to talk in terms that appealed to those who are disaffected, disillusioned, and who were looking for something, much like those who became part of Jim Jones' congregation, the People's Temple. They were lost souls. And the only difference between Jim Jones and Donald Trump is the fact that we now have social media. So all these people can find themselves in ways that they couldn't find themselves before. So he basically was a merchant of deceit, both of them, merchants of deceit, both of them making people not look at facts, not think independently, and so a story for them that was indeed destructive. This is not the first time Spirit has analogized Trump to Jim Jones. As best I can tell, she started making the comparison shortly after the 2020 election. Back in December, she spelled out the Trump Jones parallel in an interview with the Daily Beast. Spear, as I said earlier, was in Jones Town in 1978 as a political aide helping to investigate allegations of abuse. Or boss, Leo Ryan, was murdered just shortly before the mass suicide. But here's the problem for a stelter and spear. Jim Jones' rise to infamy began in Indianapolis, my hometown. Jim Jones is no mystery to me. He is not a mystery at all. The Jones Town massacre was major news in that town and in my household. In the 1950s and 60s, my grandmother, my mother, my auntie, all made several visits to Jones's church. Black religious leaders and black people found Jones's message irresistible. How could they not? He was as dynamic and orator as Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. Jones promoted racial unity in political activism and ruled the country. He aspired to be the white MLK. He proved to be a brilliant manipulator of scripture and people. Before moving to California in 1965, Jones mastered the art of packaging political Marxism with Christianity. By the time Jones and the People's Temple established their headquarters in San Francisco, Jones felt comfortable enough to fully unveil his true agenda. Communism. He disavowed Christianity and the Bible. He argued the Bible was a weapon used to oppress black people and women. He preached that America was irredeemingly racist and fascist. Any of this sound familiar? Any of this sound familiar? Jones became a major player in Democratic politics. He helped George Moscone win election in San Francisco's mayor. Jones counseled Vice President Walter Mondale and First Lady Rosalynn Carter. Jones befriended Kamala Harris' mentor and lover, Willie Brown. Allegedly. California Governor Jerry Brown said Jones was Martin Luther King, Jr., Albert Einstein, Angela Davis, and Chinese Communist revolutionary Chairman Miles Sedong rolled into one. Jim Jones used the Black Lives Matter formula 50 years ago. When you refuse to learn from history, you repeat it. Black people were repeating history. The atheists say tannic clowns on CNN, MSNBC, at the New York Times, The Washington Post, and posting on Facebook, Instagram, and Black Twitter are feeding you Marxist Kool-Aid. Donald Trump is the sugary sweetener. He makes the Kool-Aid taste good on the way down. Donald Trump is there to fool you. Brian Stelter, Jackie Spears, racial Matt Allen, Don Lemon, and perhaps the minister at your church are telling you, first it's Trump hate. It will make you feel better. No? It disguises the real agenda, the promotion of Marxism and communism. Hating anyone or anything does not improve you. It kills you. Jim Jones taught his followers to hate America. That's how he opened their minds to loving socialism and communism. The message of hate resonates with African-Americans because of the discrimination we faced. It resonates with the LGBTQ community because of the discrimination they faced. It resonates with hardcore feminists because of the discrimination women have faced. But hate is not a solution. It's a delusion that leads to awful alliances, terrible decision-making, and a convoluted worldview. Jim Jones was a communist from day one. He attended Communist Party USA meetings long before he became an ordained minister. He pretended to be a Christian to attract a following. He moved to California to do what thou willed. He headquartered in San Francisco because the environment there was more tolerant of his sexual perversions. He fled for Guyana in 1977 because a journalist was going to expose his cult's abuses. The San Francisco Chronicle, aka corporate media, wouldn't publish Marshall Kildoff's expose. He had to publish it in a monthly magazine. Jones left for his Communist Jungle Paradise, the day an editor at the magazine, read him the allegations seeking comment from Jones. Jones was a white liberal prescribing utopian death for black people. In Guyana, he literally instructed his followers to use the Bible as toilet paper. 68% of the people who moved to Jones Town were black. His United States following was estimated to be 80% black. How many times are we going to fall for the exact same banana in the tailpipe? Corporate backing of the Jim Jones slash Marxist playbook does not sanitize the wickedness. Neither does the support of LeBron James, Colin Kaepernick, Megan Rapinoe, Maxine Waters, Nancy Pelosi, Al Sharpton, and Stacey Abrams. Jackie Speer, the Jones Town victim, she's a typical political opportunist. She knows the Jones Town tragedy was a direct result of the kind of radical far left politics promoted today by Black Lives Matter and Tifa and embraced by the Democratic Party. The New People's Temple, the modern day People's Temple, is the BLM LGBTQ plus DNC alphabet mafia. It's a cult of atheist political activists who preach anti-American sentiment as a way of pushing Marxism. Your preacher, yes, your preacher is likely a brainwashed member of this cult. If he's not a member, he's probably a sympathizer who fails to recognize the danger of his sympathy. Or he's just a bad minister who lacks the courage and resolve to stick to the gospel. The promise of man-made utopia and the demonization of America's failures are a shortcut for building a following. Social media apps are flooded with Jim Jones wannabes. They call themselves Sean King, Jamel Hill, Bishop Talbert Swan, D. Ray McKesson, Charlemagne the God, among other things. Donald Trump, these are a lot of things, some of them clearly bad, but he's not the second coming of Jim Jones. The people using religion and politics to bait Black people and America into preferring communism and abandoning Christianity, they're not Trump supporters. They're Trump haters. And on Tuesday's show, Jason compares this new Wogity Woke sports era and the fact that there's no consequences to anything anybody does and the effect that it's happening on today's game and sports world overall. You need to check this without listening to this. I've been feeling for the past month or two or maybe even longer, maybe for the past year. Yes? No, no, no. This is on a very serious no-Jim. Save the jokes for about, give me two minutes, no jokes. Consequences and the elimination of consequences. I wrote a column today for the blaze about NBA free agency and whatnot. And it was about the NBA and the lack of consequences for the NBA basically turning on its fan base and on traditional sports fans. But I also saw this morning that Simone Biles, the Olympian, the face of the Tokyo Olympians, Olympics, the woman, the 24-year-old woman, American woman who basically quit on the team competition and then bowed out of a bunch of the individual competitions. She made her return to the Olympics last night, Jim, in the bean and finished in third place. And America is celebrating her third place finish and it's one of the most courageous things I think has ever been done in sports. Simone Biles had tapped out because of mental stress according to her headspace not being in the right place. She couldn't perform because her headspace was all wrong. And now that she's come back and finished third with the bronze medal, well, Hallelujah, it's one of the greatest, most courageous things. The mental toughness she just displayed is absolutely incredible. Are my two minutes up? Not quite yet. Absolutely incredible. Her finishing in third and I don't want to, look, man, I couldn't come in one millionth place at any Olympic event. I don't want to denigrate her third place finish. But this whole celebration of like it's incredible, she tapped out. She's admitted in her post performance press conference yesterday. There was nothing physically wrong with her. She just mentally wasn't in the right headspace. And she said a couple of things that I found interesting. I want to read full quotes from what ESPN reported her saying yesterday and then I want to react to a couple of them. It wasn't easy pulling out of all those competitions. People just thought it was easy. But I physically and mentally was not in the right headspace. And I didn't want to jeopardize my health and my safety because at the end of the day, it's just not worth it. My mental and physical health is above all medals that I could ever win. So to be clear, to do being, which I didn't think I was going to be, I was going to be just meant the world to be back out there. And I wasn't expecting to walk away with the medal. I, and this is the key word, I was just going out there doing this for me. And I know where you think I'm going to go like, oh, it's narcissistic. She's just doing this for me. She's not doing it for family. She's not in service to her team. She's not doing it to represent the country. She's doing this for me. The Olympics traditionally have been much bigger than the individual. You go out there and compete. Of course you're doing it for yourself, but you're also doing it to represent your country, to honor all the people who have helped you along the way in this day and age, to honor the financial contributions and support you've gotten from your sponsors. She's saying she's doing this for me. It is a touch narcissistic. It is a touch selfie, millennial generation. It is all of those things, but I also think it's a window into her soul and the window being that being that she has been tugged in so many different directions over the past five, six years of her Olympic career and tugged in so many directions since being a child because many of these Olympians start at age four, five, six, whatever and they devote their life to this. They have to, they have to maintain a certain weight and do all kinds of things and it's a big sacrifice. At the end of this, all she wants to do is something for herself. I'm almost thinking she's putting together an argument. The window into her soul is that there's something about the Olympic process and it makes me quick. Is there something about the American process that when you run the gauntlet, when you do all these things that in order to be great in America? Is the end result that you become a selfish narcissistic person? Have you made so many sacrifices in pursuit of athletic greatness that the only landing spot for you as an individual is to become a narcissist, is to become only about you? Maybe I'm not sitting here calling Simone Biles a bad person. I'm questioning or wondering about the process to greatness here in America or maybe anywhere in the world, the kind of sacrifices you have to make. I think it's unique here in America and maybe in a few other countries, is that so many people jump on your back when you're pursuing or you're close to greatness. So many corporations jump on your back and want a piece of you and want to ride your elevator to greatness in promotion of their product that it just makes you a very cynical, narcissistic, selfish person. That's what I'm hearing from Simone Biles. One of the consequences of greatness in American sports with all the pressure you get from corporations and all the directions you get pulled and everybody trying to benefit off of your success from the media, to your parents, to friends, to corporations, to everybody wants a piece of the Simone Biles pie. And at the end of that, she's been so picked apart that she becomes very narcissist and it's not about the team. It's not about America. It's only about Simone Biles. That perhaps is one of the consequences to sports greatness. What they're also coupled with that, and this is why this thing, the NBA thing I wrote this morning and I wish that I had had the ability to tie these two things together in my column, but I didn't. I didn't think of it until much later when I was thinking about Simone Biles and reading up on it, but in pro sports at this time, it's become more like Hollywood, where there are no consequences, regardless of what you do as a professional athlete or as a sports lead, as long as you promote the right message. And so the NBA has pissed on its fan base, has gone, the NFL pissed on its fan base, has gone completely woke, has gone completely anti-American, has disavowed all of the normal values that are attached to sports, the patriotism, the support for law enforcement. Again, the national anthem, there's a reason why we played the national anthem at the beginning of sporting events in America. That was to attach sports to Americana and to make people think of sports and competing in sports as the ultimate celebration of American values. Never quit. If you sacrifice for others, sacrifice for your team and for the good of everyone else, everybody benefits. These are the values. Some people listen to America was never like that. It's all a hoax. It's all a scare. No, that's not true. America's flawed like everybody else and everything else on the planet, but there was a time in America and America became great because of that time when people did sacrifice for others and the benefit of others. And people, I can see people, the cynics, the woke, the people that pander to social media, not in racist America. Yes, in racist America they did. Go back and look at the hundreds of thousands of people who sacrificed their lives in the Civil War so that Jason Whitlock and Jimmy Dodds could live free. Many of those people were white people and they knew exactly what they were doing. The overwhelming majority of those people were white people. They knew exactly what they were doing. Go read, play, or listen to the battle hymn of the Republic where the soldiers were actually singing a song that acknowledged they were sacrificing their lives so that others could live free. So don't, you know, everybody wants to point to America's tragedies and pull, oh my God, America's terrible. They did this. They did that. People don't want to talk about what America and Americans did in order to increase freedom here in this country more than any other country on the planet. We did that. But, and so what I'm saying, sports have walked away from all of that and those of us that have always liked the values preached in sports, have seen NBA, NFL players and Major League Baseball, NHL, the National Hockey Association, they've all pissed on those traditional American values. They haven't suffered any consequences. And I say that because NBA free agency started on Monday and it's a great reminder to me that NBA players have seen their ratings decline, their relevance and traction decline. People haven't really been attending games the last two years. There's been all, they've done all kinds of damage to their league. But they haven't suffered the consequences for that. We have the entertainment world which now, and I've said this for many years to friends of mine about sports, professional sports. They're just TV shows. They're just movies. Tom Brady's just playing a role on a reality TV show called the NFL. And what, and if you go look at Hollywood and the movie and TV industry, they have eliminated consequences for bad product. Hollywood over the past decade, at least the past decade has been serving up trash movies for at least a decade. Movies that bomb at the box office are poorly written, anybody would have brain would be like, wow, this is a trash movie. They've all declined. No one cares. Everybody's still getting paid. Everybody's getting paid more money. I wrote about today, Alex Caruso, relating his back to sports, the Lakers back up point guard, low bald white dude with the headband. He got a four year, $37 million contract from the Chicago Bulls. He had six points last year, four years, $37 million. They're making it rain on players all across the NBA. People, there was something to, I'm a sports fan. Shea, have you heard of Shea Gilgusson, Alexander or something like that? Plays for Oklahoma City. I think that's Ice Cube, son. He had a $172 million contract this week. Is my two minutes up? Not quite. He had a $172 million. Actually, I can't let it rain on me for a $100 million. And I'm like, God, imagine Johnson played 13 years and I understand inflation and I understand times have changed and that, that has Johnson made like 25 million over his career in 13 years and Shea, somebody who are Alexander or whatever, is getting a $172 from Oklahoma City. Where the hell Oklahoma get a $100 million from? And so, if I'm an NBA player and you sat and listened to guys like me, people over social media, oh, you're taking a dump on the NBA. We're not watching anymore. You're going to learn, we've been wagging our fingers at these guys. The customer's always right. You're going to learn a tough lesson. You're going to learn today, Whitlock. Yeah, yeah. But again, we've been telling the athletes that this dumb stuff they've been doing turning off the traditional sports fan, sabotaging their domestic appeal and television ratings and Jersey sales and all of that. We've been wagging our finger at them. Oh, you're going to pay a price for that stupidity. No, they haven't. Jim, they've paid no price in their, look, who know, maybe if they had done the right thing instead of a $172 million, this Shea guy would have gotten $230 million. He don't know nor does he care. This is all monopoly money to me and to them and what has happened in all forms of entertainment is that we've printed so much money in America. We just printed, printed, printed, printed, printed money. It doesn't matter whether the NBA product is any good. It doesn't matter if the fans, the customers enjoy the product. The gains are not presented for us, the fan. They're presented as a marketing tool and they've always been this way. It's always been this way, but it's just more pronounced now. They're presented to benefit major corporations, international corporations, and are you on message with the globalist agenda? It was like a realization to me or confirmation of a realization because Jim, I said on the Fox lot when we worked at Fox Sports, this had to be about five years ago. It was an executive. I was very close to, it's no longer there at Fox now. I don't want to attach this anybody that's at Fox because he's really, he's legitimate not there. But we sat out in that little outdoor area at Fox Sports and I can remember he sat and he was, man, when do you think this woke shit's going to end? And we sat there and guessed, it's probably got another two years, maybe 18 months, but it's all going to boomerang and it's going to come back and reality is going to set in. And that was five years ago we had this conversation. And when I look up and see NBA free agency and everybody getting paid and the NBA just marching on like nothing ever happened, like the bubble and all the Black Lives Matter messaging and the big FU that they gave all traditional sports fans. LeBron James running around, oh my god, I'm getting hunted every day, America is racist. I'm out of our Bay could have been me. I could have been jogging through an empty house. Like I'm out of our Bay. They've just taken a total dump on their fan base and they've paid no consequence. They're laughing at us. You know what happened to LeBron James if he went running through a neighborhood, white people see what they run up and asking for. His autograph. Thank you. But there's just no consequences and I analogized this. I saw it in Hollywood because I like movies. And I remember I had that great I pick theater two blocks of me where I lived on the Wilshire corridor in LA. And I used to love to go. And then literally around 2012-2013 I can say to him why are all these movies just horrible? Every movie I go to I'm walking I'm walking out of halfway through 25% of the way through. It's like man they ripping me off. It's not the same. These these because I have a high threshold and I'm a critic but it's like these movies are terrible. And I can remember every when 12 years of slave came out and and everybody's just ranting and raving about oh my god this is the greatest movie. This is 10 times better than Roots. I heard I heard Bill Maher say that on TV how much better 12 years of slave was than Roots and all this. Bill Maher said. Bill Maher said it. The white guy. Yes. Okay well he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he's qualified. Said it was better and I thought and so I go watch it and it was terrible. It was just a bunch of slavery brutality scenes strung together. There's no story. There's no nothing tugging at your heartstrings. Nothing that made you root really for of course you're rooting for Solomon Northrup to be free or whatever. You're not really rooting for anybody because they haven't connected you and again this is why I found it was so crazy. I'm off on a tangent here but this is why I found it so crazy about comparing it to Roots. It's like man they made you love Kunta Kinta. When you saw Kunta running when he finally got up enough to run and get away you was rooting for Kunta to run and when they bought Kunta back and chopped Kunta's foot off. Cried. Literally. Like a you cry when they whipped him on the deal what's saying name Toby Blobber you cry all the kizzy all of it they connected to you. 12 years of slave had no humanity no emotion no nothing and they're calling it's one of the greatest movies of all time given the Oscar and that's when I started saying man they don't care about the product they just want a message put out and the message they want put out in Hollywood is that America's evil and then there's another message and this is it relates to black content or whatever the other message is that black men are gay and they want that put out you don't have a lot but you don't have a lot of black men stepping up saying that's not true and I'm the movie that the movie this was like I think in 2016 when they came I would moonlight moonlit moonlight whatever oh I went it's one of the movies I walked out of it was just stupid but the whole point I was like look at this young black gay dude and his first experience and all this other I've only seen about half the movies I just heard about the rest but anyway I just and I look now at professional sports and they have been turned into Hollywood now I am completely 100 accurate pro sports are just like Hollywood the message far out far is far more important than the product no one the NBA is hot garbage and look I enjoyed some of the class but they shoot too many damn threes it's not as good as what it used to be that's not some old man shouting into class that's just facts they don't compete the way they used to people sit out games whenever they're tired or whatever and look maybe they are all smarter than dr j and all the guys from the old days who did foolish things and these guys are all protected themselves I don't care it's not as competitive it's not as good and the message when you look take the NFL my favorite sport these guys are afraid to hit each other the all the rules have softened the game the consequences for going over the middle as a receiver eliminated the consequences for holding on to the ball too long as a quarterback eliminated you bet you got to ask the quarterback to fall to his knees now hey i'm back here I could tap you but just take a knee I'm there will call him Kaepernick I can't hit you too hard exactly it's there's a lack of and and I guess I sound kind of defeatist today I sound like I'm giving up but that's kind of it's like the other side had maybe they've won this I started talking last week about these cultural changes and and and how quickly they happen and they happen right before your eyes and you don't even realize like damn things have changed overnight and Simone Biles quits the next day she's a hero for taking the bronze she's celebrated look out for yourself girl this ain't about screw America screw your teammates screw anybody else this is about you and I look at professional sports the NBA the NFL in particular major league baseball is part of all of the hell NASCAR with woke damn it's all it's all about message not about product and I don't know if we can ever recover those of us that have been sitting around like oh if we're just patient they're gonna learn it's gonna come back our way I don't think it is Jim we just I those of us thinking it's gonna return to the good old days and I guess now that I'm saying this out loud and listening to what I'm actually saying this whole make America great again you go it ain't gonna happen it ain't gonna happen I got it's written down right here they don't want to talk about what done made America great they don't want to talk about it because all that the consequences of what made America great because there used to be consequences for doing dumb stuff there used to be consequences for not given a full effort there used to be if you pissed the customer off there used to be consequences for that consequences are what made America great you did enough dumb stuff you died your business died your earning ability died now what did Martin Luther King do was it in Memphis with with the transportation or did he say it was consequences for how you treating black people what do you say we ain't gonna ride the bus no more it was consequences boy cops don't work because because I'm just anymore because we just printed so much money like somebody said I don't worry China's got that I know I know your American audiences dip or Nike I think Nike and major corporations are just it doesn't matter whether we attend games whether we watch games whether we buy jerseys whether we do anything there's a group of elites and if you hit the genetics lottery and can get into their little elite group of pro athletes or if you get on enough casting couches and become a big-time actor or actress and get into the little circle of elitism they're gonna take care of you as long as you stay on message that takes me all the way to it's gonna be very I asked today over Twitter you think they're gonna press charges on Andrew Cuomo with the the New York state's attorney in in New York you know just announced that he broke several laws sexually harassing people be very interested if there's charges coming from that but anyway now Jim now you have the two minutes is up if you got some jokes or I don't know I've given you a lot to I'm giving every I'm giving myself a lot to think about um first of all you're not gonna like what I'm getting ready to say and I'm gonna be very serious regarding Simone Biles I think that her actions are just simply kind of hoarse who? Horish that's my word and I don't mean that to gotta justify that okay I'm getting ready to that that's what I because I think that her actions are that of a media whore that's what I call Tom Brady that's what I call LeBron James see Tom Brady can't let you watch your NBA final without tweeting out to get his name in LeBron James can't watch Tom Brady win a Super Bowl without tweeting something out see Simone Biles couldn't let see she thought she was gonna stop the Olympics but when she found out that one furry animal don't stop no show she realized she had to jump back and she had to get her name in it see in other words this ain't like she said this is about me I need me you you get this is this is what we need Madonna said it best 35 years ago Madonna said Madonna and she talked this to Dennis Rotten said it's about pimping out yourself see we can talk about what you know you're talking about what's happening in America what's happening in sports what's happening in movies and it's real simple it's all being controlled by the advertisers you're talking about the big one these are the people paying the athletes these are big name agendas these are the people that are paying for the commercials and this is what we're getting because we've sold ourselves out and these people have let you be known hey we will do this for a price too my problem Jim is it feels like we have no recourse we the the average American sports fan we have no way of pushing back that I I did watch the NBA playoffs but I didn't watch an NBA regular season game not one and maybe I'm the sucker literally because I'm trusting they don't care that they lost me and they don't care if they they don't care if they don't replace me that they'll be the oh we'll replace them with these woke sports fans no you won't wokes people don't like sports remember remember four years ago five years ago the same level remember everybody I'm boy cutting the NFL and they did I really do believe I believe the NFL lost a significant chunk of their families do it look like the NFL care no they don't okay now there there you go and that I will be the first to admit it there probably some left us out there watching this uh Whitlock this is the whole problem with people like Whitlock and his age and they just need to accept it or dial the world has changed and you're right Whitlock you and people to think like you don't matter anymore pretty soon that seems to be the message and and and I'm sitting here saying and I know there's a bunch of people saying like hey man we paid the cost to be the boss here this is supposed to be our time and maybe we didn't and and maybe that's what again as someone who and I blame myself who who poured his life into his career and and didn't pour enough energy into his personal life and has no kids maybe it is on selfish people like me that didn't have kids or selfish people who didn't take enough time investing in their kids and we turn around and look up at this generation that's ascending and we don't like it we don't like their values and cultural norms and that's on us you know I tweeted out yesterday I don't know where it was from but it was like a bunch of four and five year old kids I saw that mess bro oh man grinding on each other to music working working and all that stuff and always humping on the young girls young girls backing it up all yeah four or five year old kids man I and and little that's on us each one of them parents no no no no no no no he they asked what for letting their kids do that mess I get it

back of your mind yeah you're listening to it but you knew from from ex-clan from all of that that we poor righteous teachers public enemy you knew are we in trouble I did in terms by the time I got to age 24 25 but I'm talking about in college and in college I didn't get it and and it just I didn't get it by the time I got to 24 25 26 because by the time I became a columnist at a newspaper I started writing about life man this music is crazy and I don't know if you remember this jam but this was no this is even this is before we met this is had to be 94 95 when did when did let's get F'd up come out when the television is 95 six yeah I can remember writing a piece in the Kansas City Star criticizing hip-hop music and you remember where you heard about that song from I had to I remember I had to go down to the the Wachin building am I getting that right now that there was some building close to the plaza and they hosted that we had to debate a town hall debate and I think big school but a bunch of the fish to yeah all came down to this deal to challenge me and to argue about my take on rap and they were threatening me or whatever and at that time I was a big old idiot too so I didn't really care but but I did start questioning it once I became a journalist but clearly I didn't do enough and we're here now in this crazy chaotic world and and I can be mad at the young people all I want but we failed them we didn't instill any values in them that would keep the American tradition on course in health maybe there weren't any values instilled in us because are not enough because we allowed it whatever the high was coming off the 1960s it created a level of delusion and immorality that we've never recovered from I'm just telling you whatever the drugs and that whole woodstock revolutionary everybody get high everybody just chill out at free sex you know promise security women y'all can get down like men men y'all can be even down like woman go ahead the whole I'm feeling very cynical today and very sad and I don't know how NBA players getting paid with locks miserable that I can see people ripping me for that but it's I'm happy for the players individually I'll screw so go get that money enjoy your life but damn it there should have been consequences to the dumb stuff they did and there's not and that's a bad sign for America now on Wednesday show Jason swung for the fences and connected all right because he covers the wrestling sensation Tamara mince and stock for those of you don't know she's the young lady that won the gold medal in the wrestling and Jason talks about what that says about our culture among these new athletes in America one of my favorite shots he took all we there was a magical moment here at the Olympics and the Americans with that dream of finally standing and talking about the Olympics Tamara mince's stock of the United States has won an Olympic gold medal I spent yeah I spent most of last night and most of this morning trying to figure out what's so different about Tamara mince's stock than everybody else at the Olympics that's she's the 28 year old black woman who won an Olympic gold medal last night in wrestling and then celebrated Jimmy you can relate to this she celebrated like it was 1999 remember 1999 oh yes I remember Prince had the song it was a song you know the artist formerly known as Prince he used to sing about 1999 back then Bill Clinton was president share had this unbelievable song called believe that was number one Ricky Martin is that the one she had the phone no she did not have the phone she was old by that time but Ricky Martin had that song living la vida loca 1999 that was you have that in your middle row of decks wow I'm just you don't remember I'm still living la vida loca why do you anyway that was a long that was two decades ago right it was common place back then for black athletes black olympians to wrap themselves in the flag and celebrate their homeland now we don't know what to expect from these guys there's an expectation of some sort of anti-american protest that's kind of what we've gotten used to American shot put her raven Saunders won the silver medal and crossed her arms in an X what kind of forever she said she did it for oppressed people across the world Saunders said that she and other athletes had been plotting ways to protest for two weeks over a group track you ever do that Jim you ever get in a group track and plan ways to protest planned ways you probably yeah that's how I got fired from the sheriff's department exactly it was his idea the group chat yeah I can believe that I don't think Tamara mince's stock was on that group texturing she's quite different after winning her gold medal she was overcome but joy she honored god and celebrated her country watch this because I knew I could do it when I first started wrestling I felt that I could be an olympic champ so I kept going I did it Sam right you did it but right now my mom my aunt my twin sister my little sister my grandma they am my little cousins they are all in Florida right now watching at 6 a.m. cheering me on my husband woke up really early to watch me so it means the world knowing that they are watching and that's all the support I needed in your wildest imagination did you think you would ever win an olympic gold medal yes 100% yes I knew I could do it I knew it would be hard I prayed that I could do it in my wildest dreams I knew it is not just that you want you are dominant I mean you won these matches convincingly did you surprise yourself at all I of course I surprised myself it's by the grace of god I'm able to even move my feet like I just leave it in his hands and I pray that all the practice that the hell that my freaking coaches put me through pays off and every single time it does and I get better and better and it's so weird that there is no cap to the limit that I can do and I'm excited to see what what I have next last question for you that American flag around your shoulders looks pretty good how does that feel to represent your country like this it feels amazing I love representing the US I freaking love living there I love it and I'm so happy I get to represent USA I love it USA honest of goodness her joy jumps through the television screen you can feel her emotion and energy her authenticity exposes the robotic fraudulent of the protesters who plot their actions for weeks what makes mince of stock different from Colin Kaepernick LeBron James and so many other of the protesting athletes Jim the answer is obvious it starts with her relationship with her father both of them the one above and the one in the ground mince of stock enthusiastically professes a relationship with god she has not chosen the secular path of her peers her dad the one here on earth was her biggest fan he died in the car accident driving home from one of her high school wrestling meets she broke down when a reporter asked her what her father would think of her gold medal performance look at this Tamara I know you lost your father in high school how do you think he would be responding right now seeing you on top of the podium here coming out he would have been the loudest one here he would be so proud he would be so happy he's from god and too he don't say this all out we're like he he like he was like enemies of Nigeria it's kind of like poetic that I had the rest of Nigeria in the finals he's from Ghana so that was kind of cool Jim it's obvious the absence of your biological father or a bad relationship with him oftentimes creates a lifelong bitterness and cynicism it's not true for everyone but it is true mince of stock's dad immigrated to America from Ghana he came here to chase the American dream he bought into this country and was rewarded for doing so his children adopted his American spirit and values broken families break the spirit LeBron James and Colin Kaepernick have and or have no relationship with their biological fathers you shouldn't be surprised that their view of America is ruled by cynicism and bitterness despite their economic riches life has been unfair to them there's no amount of money that can replace the love of a father and mother the lack of American pride is a by-product of the breakdown of the nuclear family mince of stock has modeled the behavior of her parents she's created her own nuclear family she's married to a wrestler from her college she has an unwavering commitment to her immediate family she said she's giving her Olympic prize money to her mom so her mom can start a food truck business mince of stock's parents laid an incredible foundation of support for their kids that foundation wants a daughter all the way to the olympics it was awesome to see mince of stock celebrate god her dad her mom and her country it used to be commonplace for black athletes before we turned our backs on the family structure god prescribed on Thursday Jason pulled out an oldie but a goaty car Lewis Jason sees the continued failure of the mince track and field relay team has a sign of how we're continuing to fail as a community and as a people as well i thought he dug deep to get that one i dammit he found a way to do it good job i discovered the olympic four by 100 relay team or the relay race is racist that's the only logical explanation for the embarrassing performance of the united states mince relay team last night and over the past two decades it's gotta be racism what else could it be in our country olympic level sprinting is dominated by black men the four by 100 relay requires four black american men to work cohesively together for approximately 38 seconds we can't do it we certainly couldn't do it last night and we've struggled doing it for the past 20 years in a qualifying heat at the tokyo games team USA finished six six s ix t eight six let me hold that up out of how many teams i think there were eight in the race we finished six we finished behind china behind canada behind italy behind germany behind gana it's impossible to make the relay final from the sixth place in a heat the united states won't be winning any sort of metal in the event we absolutely dominated until the race turned racist after the 2000 title at the sydney games up until 2004 team USA had won the gold in 15 of the 20 four by 100 relays held in olympic history we owned the track in virtually all the sprints we flashed our god-given gifts our work ethic and our ability to work as a team for the greater good it was a showcase of black american excellence bob hays jim hines carl louis marice green they all took the baton symbolically handed to them by jessie oens and represented the country at the highest level and something very disturbing happened at the 2004 olympics systemic racism started easing its way into the event at the athens games america finished second in greece ebron x kendy argues the systemic relay racism was always there but it wasn't until 2008 that black twitter and esp and pointed out that the proud boys trump supporters and right-wing insurrectionist began manipulating the relay batons and the baton exchange zones this manipulation made it impossible for black american men to excel in track and fields premiere relay event america has not won a single metal in the relay since white biggest took control of the relay did you know that jim i see where you're going here i would love to lie and say that i knew that but yeah i see where you go right big it's came in and and just totally took over the four by 100 relay they manipulated so we can't perform it's it's same damn thing happened to my sex life i can't make a 38 seconds even white man got that too exactly that thing listen obviously i'm being sarcastic systemic racism has nothing to do with the two decades long failure of our once dominant relay team systemic dysfunction actually explains the failure what we witnessed last night is a symptom of a larger problem we in black america are low to discuss rather than having uncomfortable conversations with white people we need to have uncomfortable conversations amongst ourselves concerning the fact that black men we don't function well together jim it's obvious to everyone else we're the only people who refuse to talk about it we just hope the crypts and the bloods get old and retire we think our kids will learn to resolve conflict without resorting to violence when white liberals decide to teach us other options if we just ignore our dysfunction long enough jim it's gonna go away if we just don't deal with it sounds like insanity to me jim it sounds like what we do we just ignore problems hoping they'll go away that kind of wishful thinking led to last night's relay fiasco what transpired last night surprised no one paying attention it's the equivalent of feigning disbelief on a monday morning when you learn of how many black men or boys were gunned down over a weekend in chicago or baltimore or india and appleis or new york kansas city black male dysfunction is expected hours before last night's qualifying heat the washington post published a long piece detailing the relay teams baton issues the piece was titled metal or nothing us men sprinters have a handoff problem the story reads is proficy last night us sprinters ronnie baker and friday kirley struggled mightily to complete the second baton exchange it took three attempts by the time it was completed baker and kirley were side by side and kirley was at a relative standstill really anchor man kravon glepsey briefly climbed the third place and then faded badly as he began to look around at his competitors reaction to this collapse was swift and angry here's a quote from uh carluis from twitter the usa team did everything wrong in the men's relay the passing system is wrong athletes running the wrong legs and it was clear that there was no leadership it was a total embarrassment and completely unacceptable for a usa team to look worse than the au kids i saw in quote from carluis one of our greatest sprinters Jim we got smoked by china not a Jamaican team led by usain boat china china one the heat germany beatus gona beatus gona advanced to the final gona apparently doesn't give a damn about the proud boys and the indirectionists all that manipulation that's been screwing us over just flies by gona and a bunch of other teams with black races we can't use covid protocols as an excuse all the other countries have had limited practices because of the pandemic you can't cover up 20 years of failure and ineptitude with excuses you know i keep making sarcastic jokes about racism i'm doing it because the most damaging racism impacting black people today is the use of racism to eliminate accountability and responsibility for black men stop right there go back because i want to repeat that i want to make sure the the back of the room can hear this you're gonna say this for you're gonna say this for people in the back yes i want to hit it i'm doing it because the most damaging racism impacting black people today is the use of racism to eliminate accountability and responsibility for black men respect our sprinters are irresponsible because we fail to hold them accountable for their failure black people across the globe immigrate to america and achieve their dreams because they embrace a far different mentality than what's cultivated in black american culture black spreaders in gona jamaica canada and everywhere else don't have the kind of baton problems we have we can't work together what happened we used to be able to what happened well you're raised in family dysfunction that dysfunction follows you for life especially when you never acknowledge it pretended never existed or if you believe it's white people's responsibility to address it or adjust to your dysfunction there's absolutely nothing wrong with black people the problem is the culture we've embraced we've embraced a culture that undermines our success we've embraced the mentality that undermines our success we've been programmed to believe our actions don't really determine our destiny the actions of white people are all that matter this worldview eliminates accountability and empowers irresponsibility rewatched the four by 100 relay qualifier from last night maybe one member of the mate one member of the chinese relay team is good enough to make our relay team but china smoked us how why it damn sure isn't talent it's culture it's an inability to set eagles aside and work together in a cohesive fashion everybody can see it let's say white people pitted us against each other let's say it started in slavery got no problem with that i actually agree with it i also think it's insanely foolish to expect white people to fix it it's not going to happen it's no different from a man breaking your leg in a fight and expecting him to do the rehabilitation only you can do the rehab black men we have a culture problem what are we going to do about it our silence is violence and on friday my boy cousin kurt kurt cousin and nfl hey man y'all do realize that this vaccine and this whole deal with players and getting shots and not getting shots it's starting to get a little bit carried away shouts out to kurt cousins and all the rest of these athletes were standing up in your taking your rights damn it this is america the land of the free and the home of the chief dammit all right you don't have to agree with minnesota vikings quarterback kurt cousins decision to remain unvaccinated against kobot 19 here we go but you should respect his courage and conviction you know who reminds me of jim oh jesus mohamadha lee the black superman floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee yeah yeah kurt cousins mohamadha lee yes i said that doesn't spend a week in the nfl's kovit 19 penalty box that's what they call the reserve kovit 19 list a vikings backup quarterback keloland moham tested positive for kovit cousins came in close contact with moham and because of that cousins is because he's unvaccinated he was sent home and unable to practice with the team the 32 year old quarterback missed four practices he said quote it was disappointing to miss practice he said this yesterday when he was finally allowed to return to practice that he went on to say in my entire college and pro career i've not missed four practices so the miss four practices in one week and not have kovit was very frustrating and disappointed end quote cousins told the media he remains committed to not taking the vaccine he said he will follow the league's burdensome protocols for unvaccinated players this pronouncement has put him in the corporate and social media cross-sears everybody's mad at kurt cousins he will likely remain a target of the vax mob throughout the season cousins signed a two-year 66 million dollar contract extension last year the big paycheck puts a big target on cousins back but there was a time not that long ago when small segments of the mainstream media would rally around a public figure willing to defy the establishment and risk ridicule okay you know who that was Jim i've already said it i'm seeing where you going here mohamad aali the black superman he floats like a butterfly he stings like a bee in fact i wish you stopped comparing that man to mohamad aali come on look cousin was non-compliant is analogous to aali's bold stance to reject induction into the military aali stood on religious principle and common sense he said quote i am a member of the black muslims and we don't go to no wars unless they're declared by aali himself aali told that to friend of mine robert looks like it was a new york times columnist at the time when he said that back in 1967 aali then went on to say i don't have no personal quarrel with those vietcon let me give you a little bit of history here jim a lot of people think that mohamad Ali said uh no vietcon ever called me the n-word and that's not what he said come on back i would happen talk to me let me see what you would let me see what you know impress me man come on you didn't say it okay look that was a hollywood and corporate media fabrication back then it was popular along anti-war vietnam protesters to say back then vietcon they never called me the n-word somebody was like using it on a sign and protest or whatever and the media and hollywood attached that statement to aali to give it to give the declaration more weight and more traction they wanted to popularize it let's move back to kirk cousins he and other healthy in their prime professional athletes have no quarrel with those corona viruses no corona virus viruses ever called an nfl quarterback to a hospital bed you see what i did there i hold on hold on you see what i did why you a mess man no corona virus ever called an nfl quarterback to a hospital bed yeah and he has no quarrel with the corona virus and nor sitty he's 32 he's in his prime he's just like another quarterback in the nfl baltimore ravens quarterback lamar jackson has tested positive for the corona twice maryland's republican governor larry hogan is trying to pressure jackson into getting the vaccine he issued a statement two days ago about jackson's back status listen to look look sort of this subtle pressure he puts on it with the rules the nfl put down i can't imagine a team wanted a forfeit of game or lose a chance of the playoffs and none of the players getting paid because someone won't get a vaccine larry hogan said the republican governor of maryland the criticism though of jackson will be muted too high risk he's black and we know corporate and social media fear criticizing black people that's racist cousins doesn't have the right complexion for that connection his critics are free to land based him however they please cousins dad is apparently fair game the anti-trump pro-colon kapurnik twitter feed resist programming spent much of yesterday attacking don cousins kirk's dad a minister who is a minister at discovery church in orlando oh boy to his more than one million followers former mba player term left-wing twitter troll rex chattman recirculated a video of don cousins complaining during a sermon that is tough to hear the voice of god because cancel culture and critical race theory are so pervasive throughout our society and academia but let's take a listen to the controversial words of kirk cousins dad don take a listen for yourself you have my friends elk's end of the great head and agenda eight off hitler head and agenda satan has an agenda and he controls the institutions of the world to message you and me and in the midst of that it's tough to hear the voice of god i don't want to go down to the road of all the implications that we're facing today in our country but with regard education for example friends our textbooks are being rewritten history is being changed cultures being canceled we have statues of people being torn down religion is being silenced as god is being removed from our culture and prayer has been banned from schools athletics if you're at all tuned in to pro sports these days and what's unfolding there you know the platform that's taking place friends the voice of god's enemy through the platforms of the world is loud and it is dominant so if you do not make every effort to hear the voice of god you will be seduced to believe the messaging of the world don cousins sounds a lot like jason whiplock right he doesn't sound much different than me and things that i say and believe but according to his twitter don cousins religious beliefs are a bad look for kirk cousins you know the same way Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm x's religious beliefs were a bad look for Muhammad Ali the black superman floats like a butterfly sting like a bee this isn't about whether you believe in Ali's anti-war stance or his religious convictions this is about consistency of point of view you can't pretend to love Muhammad Ali and hate kirk cousins it's inconsistent i can hear my critics now yes you not hear them right now jim their chasing to consist of for you that's what that's that's Ali that caused you about a hundred twitter follow it i'm sorry i'm sorry to respect Ali and ridicule Colin Kaepernick it's not Ali stood on his religious convictions go ahead whether i agree with those convictions whether i agree with the nation of Islam that doesn't matter it's irrelevant to me respecting Ali or any man or woman for upholding their religious tenants kapernik as far as i know stands on no religious principle he's a marxist tool a communist a sympathizer for socialism communism those people don't believe in god black lives matter is an atheist movement kapernik stands was far more opportunistic than principle Ali actually believed in his actions so does kirk cousins his father and christianity taught cousins not to be controlled by irrational fear fear is what is driving vaccination insanity cousins does not fit the profile of someone who could be harmed by coven i do i fit that profile not kirk cousins it makes perfect sense for kirk cousins to be reluctant to inject an experimental non-fda approved drug into his healthy body the people pressuring him to do so are unconcerned with cousins as hell or the health of cousins as family they're concerned about themselves and that includes cousins as head coach vikings head coach Mike Zimmer Zimmer wants things to be easier for the vikings in himself the rest of the vax mob just wants cousins and everyone else to take the same risk they have in taking the experimental jab it's a cold applying pressure to non-believers i respect cousins' decision to stand firm in his beliefs all right now listen if you want to see more fearless with jason with like
