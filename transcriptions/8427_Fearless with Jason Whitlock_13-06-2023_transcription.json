Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blaisetv.com slash The Blind. Welcome. Welcome to Fairless with Jason Whitlock. I am Jason Whitlock, your host, Happy Tuesday. Glad you made it. Awesome show plan for you today, this week. Shamika Michelle back in studio with us. Round of applause. Always great to have Shamika in studio with us. Royce White is going to be with us just around the corner. So it's the Kim and so is Charlie Kirk, an action-packed show plan for you. We'll start with a fire starter. We'll also start with you slamming that like button and slamming that five-star review on Apple. If you're watching on YouTube, hit the likes, hit the subscriptions, hit subscribe, tell your friends to come watch and join us. If you're on Apple, give us the five-star review right in a review of this show. Today's show, fantastic. We're going to use sports to help explain the world. Let's get right into it. Nicola Yokej's NBA Finals MVP and championship hit different. Meaning, they do not feel nearly as important as his predecessors crowning achievements. That's not intended as a knock on the Serbian superstar who secured his first title Monday night with a victory over the Miami Heat. It's a knock on the NBA and Nike's 30-year global mission. Globalism diminishes and dilutes everything it touches. Last night, following the Denver Nuggeth 94-89 victory, Yokej and his teammates had the most subdued championship celebration, perhaps, in the history of American sports. When asked by ESPN sideline reporter Lisa Salter's, how it felt to be champion of the NBA, listen to Yokej's reply. Now you are an NBA champion, Nicola. How does that feel? It's good. It's good. The job is down. You can go home now. Congratulations. That's not quite Kevin Garnett's shouting. Anything has been possible! Did I say that anything is possible? He didn't say impossible. But anyway, remember that in 2008? Inside the Nuggeth's locker room, there were no iconic moments of Yokej sobbing and hugging Delario Bryan Trophy with his dad comforting him. That's what Michael Jordan did in 1991 after winning his first title. In the moments after winning, Yokej spent more time hunting down Heat players to acknowledge and console than reveling in what his dominance created. Again, I'm not knocking at Nicole Yokej. He strikes me as humble, well-intentioned, and rational. He also strikes me as someone well-aware that the NBA isn't all that important. That's not good for American basketball. Passion fermits fanaticism and fanaticism drives interest in the game. Despite the best efforts of ESPN and Fox Sports 1, the debate shows the NBA is a lot less interesting than it used to be. Globalism is partially to blame. The NBA's best players, Yokej, Yada Santuacoupo, Joel Embi, Luca Doncett, Shay Goches, Alexander, I don't know if I said that right, Shay Alexander from OKC, they weren't born in the States. They didn't spend their childhoods following, thinking about, and learning the unique histories of NBA franchises. MB and Shay Alexander each had a tiny cup of coffee in American college basketball. The foreigners do not revere the players who made the NBA great or the league's history the way LeBron James and Steph Curry do. They can. Nor should they be expected to. The lack of reverence leads to a lack of passion. For Nicole Yokej, the NBA is a fun, high-paying job. It allows him to take care of his family. It's a great nine to five. It's not how he defines his journey as a man. He couldn't care less what Kendrick Perkins thinks of him or his back-to-back MVP trophies. This is healthy for Yokej. It's bad for the NBA. It's an unintended consequence of the league's pursuit of global dominance. In the aftermath of Mattie Johnson and Larry Bird making the NBA relevant to American sports fans, then Commissioner David Stern, at the behest of Nike founder Phil Knight, embarked on a journey to make the association a global force. The real purpose of the 1992 Dream Team, the collection of NBA stars who competed in the Barcelona Olympics, was to make the world pay attention to Michael Jordan and the league he dominated. A decade after the Dream Team, Stern and the NBA negotiated a deal with the Chinese Communist Party to make Yao Ming the number one pick of the 2002 NBA draft. Making Ming an NBA star, he'd stern strategy of one day landing a television contract from the CCP that would dwarf all the combined TV rights deals of the NFL. Globalism was going to make the NBA, and more importantly, Nike, more powerful and popular than the NFL. Starting with Tim Duncan, who was born and reared in the Virgin Islands, 10 of the last 22 NBA MVPs were born outside the United States. On to the Kumpo, Yokej and Embiid have won the last five MVP titles. The NBA has been globalized. It's not as interesting. It's not as passionate. As the kids say, the league hits different. There's no loyalty. As fearless contributor Royce White likes to say, there's no sacred honor. Players hop from team to team. Look at LeBron James and Kevin Durant, the two most talented players of this era. They've played for seven teams combined. Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and Michael Jordan played for four. When you remove borders, you remove boundaries. You decrease the value of honor, fidelity and allegiance. Professional sports are just another TV show, no different from the Sopranos or Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones. A compelling narrative arc mixed with great character development determines the popularity of a TV show. Tony Sopranos' complicated relationship with his mother and wife made the Sopranos must-see TV. We knew Tony's backstory. We could relate to Tony's backstory. He captured our imagination. Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan and LeBron James captured our imagination. They were great American narrative arcs. The same is true for NFL stars. We know even more about them because their stories include fascinating college careers. We'll never relate to Nicole Yokech, Luca Donkech and Janis Antutikumpo in the same way. They're great players, great people. They're not as relatable and they don't care about American traditions and history the way we do. Yokech wants to go home. I don't blame him. Being a global citizen is overrated. Do we have the clip of Yokechs that I asked for? The clip of Yokech talking about the parade. This is the button I want to put on that whole deal. You said after the Lakers, you were surprised that you didn't feel more. So I'm curious what you are feeling right now and if you're looking forward to a parade coming up in Denver. Many sprays. Thursday. No. I need to go home. Okay. That says it all about the NBA, Nicole Yokech and not, I don't blame the guy. I'm not at all taking a dump on Nicole Yokech. He's got the right attitude. But this is the consequence of globalism and injecting all the foreigners into an American product. It dilutes the American product. It dilutes the passion for the American product. This whole little open borders, no loyalty, no nothing. This all takes a toll on traditional American institutions. This is why people, oh, you should quit talking about sports. You should, you're now not a sports commentator. You're now more of a political, you're a culture guy. I'm never going to leave sports because you can tell the entire American story just by analyzing sports. Sports are central to the American narrative and arc and who we are. And every problem that is plaguing America can be seen first or most brightly or most understandably in the sports world. That's why I want to bring Royce White into this conversation and Royce is someone that loves to tell us and he's accurate. Hey, you guys want to jerk off and play video games? You guys want to watch your sports and go to movies and all that and you want to ignore the real issues going on. And Royce, this is where I say, this is why I think basketball and these sports are so important. It's a way of unpacking all the issues you want to get at in a way that's relatable to the average idiot like myself. And so I look at Nicole Yokez and what's going on with the NBA and I can see the things I don't like about the NBA and I can connect it directly to globalism and it helps me understand why this is why America, we don't respect American traditions, institutions, the uniqueness of being an American. And now that we have this league without borders and players run off to this country, that country during the summer, they don't care as much about the game. They don't care about loyalty. There is as I quoted and I don't really have a question. I just want you to respond and jump in here. But as I quoted you, this is all a part of why there's no sacred honor to almost anything anymore. Well, yeah, first off, I'm going to start with this. I'm not accepting that you're this idiot that you like to claim to be on this show with that fire starter as in depth as you went. There's no way you can pass that on me. You might be able to pass that on some other jerk offs who watched the show, not me though. I'm not buying it. That was an incredible fire starter. That's as clear and it's in depth of an analysis of the situation as you could possibly do. I don't see anybody who does analysis like that. So I'm not buying the stupid deal. And I'm also not buying it from the American people. I know the American people have a vested interest to play along with the stupidity, but I don't really buy that they're stupid. And I don't buy that they can't be related to with deeper and more intellectual issues. I think that the high is just really good. Like a crackhead will go to jail if they know they can get a fix. That says something about the power of crack in the human mind. Sorry, I just had to start there. But as far as your kids goes, look, the guy's an incredible player. He's one of the best basketball players I think I've ever seen from a skill standpoint. And it's not just a skill. It's his understanding of the game. It's his understanding. It's his ability to see the next play. It's ability to see steps ahead. It's what makes a chess player a great chess player is what makes a mixed martial artist or boxer a great a great mixed martial artist a boxer. It's what makes any athlete a great athlete the ability to see ahead. Now he wows us because his body is not typical of elite athletes throughout history. It doesn't resemble this elite athlete body. Even for big men, you take Kareem, you take Wilt, you take Hakeem, you take KG, even Tim Duncan was a world-class swimmer before he ever set step foot in the NBA. These guys were athletes. This guy doesn't look like an athlete and he's done a great job to slim his body down even from a few years back where he was severely overweight in my opinion and has paid dividends for him. But it's not about that athleticism. He sees the game a step ahead. The flip side of that coin is that the game is extremely soft. The game has become extremely soft. I don't believe personally that yokies would be able to have the same type of success in the true big men era where you had the Rashid Wallaces and the Chris Webbers and the Kevin Gardenettes and the Antonio McDyce and all these other big men that actually lay wood on you would put a forearm on you would bump you over the course of four quarters. It was a dogfight. It was especially a dogfight for post players and big men, but it was also a dogfight for guards. I grew up in the 90s. So we watched basketball play the last era of tough physical basketball. I don't think yokies would have the same success that he is having now statistically in that era. I also don't think many of the guards would have the same success. I bring that up because this entire softness, this entire offenseification, if that's a word, making the game more offense dominated is the product of globalism. This is the resignation of the sports world saying, hey, how can we draw as many short-term gratification eyeballs as we can? It's the same thing with the alcohol. The alcohol was the predicate. The alcohol being sold and I'm not for monitoring whether adults drink alcohol or not. All I'm saying to sports fans out there is if you can't enjoy the nuances and beauty of sports without being drunk, it denigrates the sports. So that already laid the pathway, that laid the groundwork that in order to enjoy the sports, in order to enjoy the beauty of the game, you got to be drunk or you should at least be allowed to get drunk. I don't believe in that. And I believe that this next iteration of let's make the game all about offense. Let's make the game. How many points can you score? Now we're going to score 145 points in four quarters or whatever the case may be threes and analytics. And Darryl Morrie who helped usher in the Yao Ming deal that you spoke about, by the way, we're going to make this game hyper-offense. And that way the younger people will have more, you know, there'll be more tension in eyeballs on the game. This is what globalism brings you. You're right. It does water down things. It does water down things. And that's not on, that's not on your kids. It's on the rest of us. I want to spend a little time just talking about your kids. And I know, particularly me, I've never met him. I'm just speculating from afar. But when I watch him in the way he ignores a lot of the noise, like Kendrick Perkins and a Mark Jackson leaving him off the ballot and say, oh, it's an oversight to Lisa Salters. These are people Kendrick Perkins, Lisa Salters, Mark Jackson, these kinds are highly connected to the NBA and either left him off their MVP ballot claimed he shouldn't get the MVP because he's white and, you know, he's getting this favoritism. And Lisa Salters, hey, you know, this is the first time this year I've seen him play. These are people very connected to the game. Yokez doesn't care about any of that because, and again, I know I'm speculating, but I think he's laughing at American culture. And I think he's laughing at a lot of without saying it without being disrespect. I think he's laughing at a lot of his competitors in the NBA that don't know how to play the game the right way that have allowed someone who can barely jump over the telephone book if they had telephone books anymore be this dominant in this game because they don't know how to play either. They're too high. They're too disinterested. They're too caught. Again, could you imagine? I'm sure Yokez, when they're canceling games over Jacob Blake and everybody's to all these gestures and stuff like this. And this dude was like, I'm from Serbia. This is silly. This is stupid. These guys are always looking for an excuse not to play. And so when I hear the guy basically say, man, I got to get home. That's a guy that's like, I'm over here to collect this check. I deal with American idiocy, but I can't wait to get back home to my family, my people, my culture. And I look at it and juxtapose it to the American athlete who doesn't have that kind of reverence or gratitude or respect for their own country. And I think I would love to be a flower on the wall when Yokez and his brothers were flying home and what they're really saying about the guy's Yokez is competing against. Well, look, the Eastern European culture is a very, very different culture. And Serbia has a very unique geopolitical history, very close ties to Russia, which is unique for those Eastern block countries. There's conflicts that have gone off between Russia and certain Eastern European countries because of the Russians' affection with the Serbians. But that's a history for people to look into themselves. My point is that you can tell that Yokez is not interested in all the extracurricular. Look, in many ways, I agree with you because I'm a young black man. I came up through the 90s, do the bulls' air. Then I was here in Minnesota. I got to watch KG. It's funny that you use KG because he's kind of the symbol of passion. And I want to say this, I think KG represents a passion that you need to stabilize a team when a team doesn't have stable and sound fundamental players across the board. Denver benefits, this is basketball, more basketball, but Denver benefits from having a core group of guys that are all very fundamentally sound. They don't need a stabilizing vocal leader. So it's kind of unfair to compare KG and Yokez in that way. Jamal Murray doesn't need Yokez's stability. Raizjan Rondo did need KG's mentorship and stability. It helped Raizjan become the leader that he would become. Jamal Murray doesn't need that. Jamal Murray is as steady as they come. Michael J. Porter, who's been hurt for a long time, as he gets stronger, it's hard for me not to see the Denver Nuggets winning again if they all stay healthy. And Yokez is maybe the prime candidate to have some physical troubles just because the way his body's built. But if they all stay healthy, it's hard for me not to see them winning again next year. Barring some trades and things in the off seasons like Durant, where he ends up and where Kyrie ends up, stuff like that. But my point is that Yokez isn't interested in the extracurricular. And part of that is because in the Eastern Bloc, they have culture, they have an identity, they have national identity, they have been imbued with this sense of historical identity and sacred honor. Black people here in America are identity, are identity is our sports. Kanye West told these sellouts, when you don't have land, you settle for brands. And one of the biggest brands to black people is the NBA and in our contribution to American society, do the NBA. And it's how blacks have been cooked to the corporatocracy at mass. And this is why I'm one of the main people behind the scenes telling you, you're not a sports journalist. You're not a sports journalist. You're one of the most important political voices in American history. And we have a corporatocracy, the same corporatocracy that pays the NBA's bills, the same Pfizer that's paying for the ads. We have the corporatocracy going after a former president on explicitly political selective political prosecution right now today. Jason Whitlock's one of the only people out there on YouTube who tells the truth who hasn't been censored. My channel is certainly getting throttled. My episodes coming on tonight, you can't even find me in the search bar on YouTube. You're one of the most important political voices in the world. We as black men have to save this country. And it's not just black men, but we have to light the fuse. We have to lead the way. But so many of us are worried are jacking off watching basketball. I love basketball. I watch it with my son, but I make sure my son watches Malcolm and Steve Bannon and all these people after he's done or in between. I have a serious doubt that the people who spend a short amount of time watching sports aren't coupling that with betting on sports, with following up on sports in the morning, with watching all the commentary around sports. There's like a full spectrum jerk off around sports. And all Yokech is saying is like, I'm not interested in no parade. I just spent nine months, 10 months out of a year, just given every single ounce of my fat body to this game. I don't want to come jerk off at a parade with the people of Denver and act like we're one big family. We're not. I'm from Serbia. I'm not Mormon. I'm not Mormon, but you know what I mean? You know, I'm not interested in it. I'm not interested in the charade or the parade. I'm ready to go home and rest. So let me end this part of discussion with a more frivolous conversation. But you kind of went there. You open the door for me to do this, Royce, because I do want to have this discussion. You've said off top that, hey, Yokech in a different era wouldn't be what he is right now. And so I've seen some people jump to, hey, he's a legend now. You can now mention him with some of the five, six, seven, eight greatest centers of all time. I don't know if I'm ready to go there. And I respect him. I think it's great what he accomplished. But someone said he's a top five all time center. And I was like, hold on, really? Because I just start just off the top of my head, I went green, Bill Russell, Wilc Chamberlain, Shaq, Moses Malone, Hakim Elijah Wan. That's six that I'm saying, I can't put Yokech with those six. I just can't. And then there's David Robinson. And I'm not sure if he's better than David. And so there's seven. And I'm saying, is he really Bob Lanier? He's probably better than Bob Lanier. But I don't know if he put him in that era. He wouldn't be shooting threes like he is now. Where does Yokech, does this season and his accomplishments, does it put him in a top five conversation? I mean, I'm just in all honesty. Yes. Okay. Yes, he does. It does. Let me take two different Let me take two different sides of this real quick. Number one, let me stop before you go. Because I just want you to think about what you're saying. I get he just won a title. He's top five. Come on, Royce. No, listen, listen, listen, listen, I'm going to just say that right now, if his career stopped today, if his career stopped today, listen, this peak, listen, listen to, listen to, it's not Bill Walton's peak. Go back to Bill Walton, Portland and his MVP season. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Listen to me. Now. Okay. From a basketball standpoint, first of all, it's inappropriate to compare players across generations. You are the, you are the players. You're only as good by good or bad by comparison. You're only as good or bad by the players you played with. You can't compare players across generations in the true sense because you can't help the players you played with. He can't help that he didn't play against Kareem or Will to build Russell with Shaq, just like Shaq can't help that he didn't play against Kareem, just like Kareem couldn't help that he didn't play against Bill or Will. You can't help that. You're only good or bad by comparison. Right now with the players that he's playing against with the game that he's in with the culture that's built around it, the rules, changes and all of that, he's dominant. Somebody else could have rose up and been dominant in that era too. They could have been black, white, Chinese, green from another planet. It doesn't matter to me. What I'm saying is, right now the skill that he's shown, skill-wise, he's unstoppable. He's virtually unstud. The only consideration is if you could be more physical with him, if you could be more physical with him, which I actually believe, I actually believe if you were able to be more physical with him, that he wouldn't be as productive, but he may be able to adjust to that because he shows a great adaptability in the game. The man that is virtually, I think he's involved in probably like 60% of the offense for the Denver Nuggets, 60 to 70%. The most impressive quality is the passing. No doubt. He's quite arguably the best passing big man of all time. Bill Wald would like to have a word with you, but go ahead. Yeah. I know you. But Bill wasn't shooting a trade ball like that. Okay. That's what they were. Nobody was shooting the trades then. But hey, they're all rebounding defense, passing leadership. When he was healthy in Portland, you want to talk about unstoppable. Go ahead. He could play. No doubt. I mean, Kevin McKill right here from Minnesota, he was a power forward, but he was a great player as well. But the game evolves. And we have to, the nostalgia around the greats in history doesn't accept the game and the evolution the way it really is. Jamal Murray is as good of a guard, as good of a combo guard as we've ever seen in the NBA from a skill standpoint. Jamal, and look, I love Isaiah Thomas, grew up in the Midwest, my dad's from Detroit. Isaiah Thomas would have a tough time guarding Jamal Murray. He's big. He's fast. He's strong. He wouldn't have to. Who would Joe Dumars would have a tough time guarding Jamal Murray in the game today? I'm just, I'm just keeping it. Look, Tracey McGrady would have a tough time guarding Yannis on the plate. The game evolves. All right. But listen, this is what I'm saying, when it comes to all time, I don't even like the top guard. The only guy that gave Michael Jordan trouble, but couldn't handle Jamal Murray. I know, I know Joe could go ahead. No, no, no, Joe could know, but what you got to realize is listen, listen, turn me into a new man. Now Joe Dumars didn't Joe Dumars didn't give Michael Jordan problems. The Detroit Pistons as a team gave Detroit prop gave Michael Jordan problems. And the real problems they gave him is they were allowed to bite scratch and pull him out of the air, which really isn't real defense. They made an argument for the opposite. They actually ushered in the, you know, the passive offensive friendly, referring today. You could talk to the great Kenny Ma about how that whole thing went down. So Michael Jordan was dominant. Don't get me wrong. The all time list, I don't even like. I think too many people spend too much time on all time lists. I'm looking on the internet. And I see constant, constant arguments that is a reflection from the barbershop culture. I mean, heated, heated, life staking arguments about who's top five. You're a jerk off. Who cares? You couldn't throw a ball in. Not you, but most guys out there, you couldn't throw a ball in. You can barely, you can barely make it five miles on a treadmill. And you want to talk about who's better? Will the all time athlete or yokech, the all time pinnacle of basketball skill? What does that bear on you? They're coming to take your freedom. Now, if you ask me an all time top five list, yokech is right up there. He may be on, maybe off, but he's right up there. I mean, it's so inconsequential to me. I'm worried about going to nuclear war. I don't know what everybody else has going on in their life. I know, I know, but just keep in mind, Royce, you were the first one to say, I didn't even say you brought it up. They're like, Hey, in a different era, you could bump even do this or that. You brought it up, Royce. Yeah. Yeah. No, he was a little bit. He would have a little bit of trouble. And I'll tell you why. I'll back my point up. I'll back it up. Yeah. He would have a little bit of trouble because his body isn't built. He's not built well. Okay, he's not a he doesn't have an athletic body. And so I take a mixed martial artist. Right. It's one take a pot shot of me every time he does this. Is he really subtweeting me right now? Every time he says he doesn't have an athletic body. Yeah. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Because I'm looking at him and I'm like, they're bigger, but those are noodle arms. Like there's no definition in his arms. I don't see the deltoid or the ice. Very uncomfortable with this whole conversation. My point is this. My point is this that yokeage if the game was as physical as it once was, and he had to go against the long list of very, very good big men and that constant bumping for 80 to 90 games a season and then a playoffs, I don't know if he would have the motor to do so. And you're also talking about an era where guys weren't getting rested. You played all the games, you played through injuries. You didn't rest for three games because I just am. I mean, I'm going to start. That wasn't a real thing. So I'm saying that he might have, he might not have been as productive 40, 20 and 10. But would he be good enough to still be dominant? Absolutely. Absolutely. Well, he just probably wouldn't be able to do it at that level. 10 points is a big deal. I mean, a 40, 20, 10 triple double and a 25, 18 and 10 triple double is a big difference statistically. And the softness of the game allows for that allows for that. It's unimportant. Don't worry about it. Hey, Royce, thank you so much. I got to go. She meek has dropped her earpiece and now she's scratching her microphone. She's doing all kinds of things to distract me. But Royce, great job. I finally got Royce in an inconsequential conversation. I enjoyed it. Enjoyed the conversation about Nicole Yolkins.

Time for some Korean Co-Sell we've been talking about Nicola Yolkich. We heard from Roy Swight. Now we want Steve Kim's take on the Denver Nuggets star. Now NBA champion. Now NBA Finals MVP. Now a guy that can't wait to get home to serve you and get the hell out of America. Steve what did you think of Nicola Yolkich's reaction to becoming a champion and really kind of being like I really don't care I just want to go home. What do you read into that? I didn't really take it that way Jason I think this is a guy who in the immortal words of Chris Rock they did what they're supposed to do. They were the best team he's the best player it's matter of fact we're gonna be here many more times this is just the first of one and Jason I read your column and I I disagree I actually like how he just took it and stride that he's a great player he's got much more to accomplish but he's gonna keep things in perspective he's not looking to go viral he's not trying to be the athletic sun zoo and give some platitude that he read in a book and and be popular off of it he did his job it was a job well done and now he goes home and it's about proper priorities let's be honest he didn't save cancer he didn't save any lives all he did was win an NBA title and we'll see him in a couple months in training camp we'll put up another MVP campaign well done that's a serious person. Okay and so you know the history of sports as well as I do if not better when the Miami Hurricanes win a championship they certainly don't act like Nicola Yolkich when Michael Jordan when Muhammad Ali when I mean I can't think of anybody who's ever won the crowning achievement in their sport allegedly that has his reaction and so you have to ignore it was rather unique I get that you'd like it in a world where all these athletes are fake and they're all hey look at me but that was a pretty unique reaction no no you're right see you're absolutely right but we are talking about authenticity here and if that is authentic to how he feels and his culture and his upbringing we don't have to like it we don't have to agree with it but I love the fact that he's just being who he is I don't expect him to react like Kevin Garnett or Magic Johnson who are certainly much more exuberant you know in life there is this thing certain guys are all flash right but they're not really what you think they are or they're not as good as they're hyped up to be in other words they're much more sizzle than steak well Nicola Yolkich he is fillet minyone I mean that effort that he put up throughout the regular season and now the playoff which was a historic run and now he just says you know what my job is done here I've brought Denver great joy and if that's the way he is as a personality and that reflects who he is I don't necessarily love it but I do respect it is it good or bad or no or is it nothing to the NBA that their best player kind of like ah one championship no big deal it's a lot better than their one of their better players having a gun and playing white herb I mean oh you just went what about huh what about far I mean think about it I mean I'm happy for Denver and I enjoyed this NBA final so I actually did watch pretty good amount of it I love the fact that they're a really good team they have great complementary parts like Gordon who I thought did some great work yesterday doing all those other things that your superstars aren't expected to do he plugged a lot of gaps I have a lot of respect for what that guy does that they're an organic franchise they're not going to ever really get the big name super team put together through free agency and they have a guy that seems to like say you know what I'm going to be the anchor of this franchise and guys like Jamal Murray who rebounded and I also love the fact that Yoakitch winning the title this year caused a gnashing of the teeth from all these NBA pundits who doubted him I mean jase I'm not gonna lie to you I almost felt like putting on a throwback Alex English jersey because I wanted them to win this just for the reactions that they were gonna cause you don't remind me of one of my favorite best episodes of Martin I think it was I don't know what season it was do you remember when Pam and Tommy started to date behind everyone's back and then Gina found out about it and she could not wait to look at the reaction of Martin who almost had a heart attack that's one of the classic episodes by the way when they were found out they're in the living room and when that clock was running down I was like oh I can't wait oh I turned into a nugget fan and so and I just loved and I this is why I enjoy Yoakitch's game it's a smart intelligent game and he makes so many of the right reads wherever he has the ball low post high post above three point line the reads that he makes are incredible but the thing that I love about his game is that being this relatively slow unathletic white guy it debunks any arguments that no one in the 80s could play today because my argument if Yoakitch can dominate what makes your thing a chemo la juan couldn't so he fills a lot of boxes for me god bless that fine young man fine young man Steve I'm want to occur ball although I told you about this I'm more throwing a curve ball for just to the knees guys I want to play the clip of Shannon Sharp and skip Bayless today you know Yoakitch should get credit for ending undisputed a few days early by wrapping up this series in five games. Shannon Sharp made his last appearance on undisputed today and I want to play you the clip of skip and Shannon talking about it and I want to know if you buy what they're selling. Yes. Skip Bayless. You fought for me brother. Did I? I'm here because of you. You've allowed me to share the stage with you. You allowed me to share the platform. I'm gonna cry on the car but I'm not gonna cry now. The opportunity that you gave me to become what I became I'm forever indebted to you. I'll never forget what you did for me. You've helped me grow more than you ever know. Okay this is not easy for me either. One more thing one more thing. One more thing. All I ask is when you lay your hand on that pillow at night. Yo I gave you everything I had. You did. I gave you everything I had. Which is why I want to thank you for all you have given to me. When I first took this job back in June of 2016 we had a whole nother format in mind until it became clear Shannon Sharp is available and I said I believe he can do this and did you ever the critics just savaged us when we first started undisputed will never last at this one will never last. Did we ever show them. I want to thank you for dedicating yourself to this job. It is a voracious beast of a show day after day after day. You dedicated yourself to this job just the way you dedicated yourself to professional football as a Hall of Famer. I want to thank you for never taking a sick day. I want to thank you for preparing as hard as you could every single day every single topic. I want to thank you for competing as hard as you competed with me because the greatest compliment I can give you is you were a worthy adversary. I want to thank you and tell you that I love you for what you have done for me and I'm good Shannon. I'm going to miss our diet do bets. You owe me a lot. I do. I do. I'm going to miss our LeBron battles even though he's still the phony goat. I'm going to miss our cowboy arguments. How about them cowboys because you were right about my Dallas Cowboys from day one. In the end I just want you to know that it was because of you you made possible a very very special time in my career and this is a happy sad moment for me because I look forward to your next great achievement and it is coming. But tonight I just want you to know I will toast you with a diet Mountain Dew. Thank you. You buying that kill. Well okay now does that not make you appreciate the stoicism of yolk-ish. Say you ripped the guy you right or you're at a whole column. Say oh my god you know what isn't that preferable. It's look do I think the words were sincere. I do. They were partners in crime they did some good things it was acromodious at the end but the emotions of it the tears I'm out. God that looked uncomfortable to watch. Last week the guy was liking tweets call and skip a piece of crap. I am great. Last week. Okay but there are a lot of marriages that end with people fighting each other hitting each other throwing each other's clothes on fire like you know what is that movie the one with Angela Bassett. Waiting to excel. Waiting to excel. She excels all right. But anyway but at the end you know when they have to split up the kids and they're moving out who gets the dog. You still have feelings. I mean it's still a relationship of some sort. So I kind of disagree with you which I'm glad after that after that mess y'all created yesterday on New Orleans. I'm glad she because I'm the right side of this argument. You just yeah I didn't cry the day I got divorced and I certainly didn't cry like moving out with it like that part was over. And so I don't buy any of this whole you know it's like the world's smallest violin should have been playing. I didn't buy any of that. Oh you know especially after he was liking those tweets. No way. Just last week he's liking tweets calling skip a piece of doodles. Steve and now you didn't scare. I just want to thank you. Oh thank you thank you. You didn't want to commit. He did not. He did not want to commit the sin of ingratitude. Now again do I think he went over the top when you went dick for a meal. Yes but you could still have animus you could have certain feelings yet still at the same time be grateful for the things a relationship gave to you. Look it was time for them to part and they have now parted ways. You could still at look if any relationship that you have Jason with his personal or business is 95% fruitful. Okay and it advances you in a certain way professionally or personally. Yes that 5% maybe very painful you may not like it but why overlook the other 95% seriously. Steve Steve. Who quits a job on a Tuesday? It's Tuesday. If any of that were legitimate if any of that were legitimate you work through the week it ends on Friday. It's not like whoo games over. I'm out of here. The very next day it's over. The Susan B.H. Championship is over. You don't work through Friday if any of that is legitimate. Again. Again. Sometimes partying is switch sorrow such sorrow or something like that. Maybe they just don't have anything to talk about now. I mean maybe maybe the Fox management said okay some of the NBA finals is over you guys are done. We don't really know the parameters of that agreement. We don't know who pulled the plug who went Dr. Kavorki in there. I mean look it is we have been talking. It's certainly wasn't a guy liking tweets calling the other guy a piece of doodoo. He didn't do it. No. No. Okay. He should have been. Were you on the OJ jury? No. There's blood everywhere. OJ's hands cut. There's blood in Bronco and Steve's like whoa. Okay. All right. Well with that said what that said let me go Johnny Kimkren here. Obviously they did not fit so now they must quit. They got me come off. We've been doing shows for five six months about how they don't get along. There's a lot of conflict. There's a lot of animosity. It's very tense. Okay. So now they decided to shake hands and at least leave on somewhat good terms. Now do I again do I think the emotion was a little bit something over the top. Yeah I do. I do but there's nothing wrong with just saying you know what let's remember the good times. How about even skip pretending like they set the television ratings world on fire. Yeah. Everybody said this wouldn't work and this blah blah blah. No they didn't. I mean and boy did we prove them wrong. The whole thing was phony. I should have just talked about the game and at the end of the show said hey brother man good luck to you. Good luck to you. But putting on all this extra deal about I love you. You don't love a person who put you in the crosshairs of every idiot. LeBron James, John Moran, Demar Hamlin. You remember the Demar Hamlin thing how skip basis. I mean not skip Shannon basically pointed a finger from Black Twitter saying hey set this man on fire. And if you catch him out in the street give him a beat down for me. Oh look what he did to Demar Hamlin. This man put skip in danger and I love you Shannon. This is I got more respect for Biggie and Pop. Put on this track. Oh god. Put on. Okay Jason it didn't end with this track by the way it ended up with them dying. But anyway how do you know that skip. How do you know that skip didn't say all right you know what then you know skip is a certain way. He has his idiosyncratic ways. You know that he's very temperamental. How do we know that it wasn't skipped that said okay soon as the NBA Finals is over I'm going to turn the page and let's move on to my next partner. We don't know that. We do not know that Jason. That would have been fine but it's the theatrics that they did for this show like I was waiting for them to say holy death can keep me from it. You know it's just too much. Something's going on with you. That new Orleans conversation yesterday. Now for this conversation I thought I knew you and now I'm starting to I don't really know you that there's something is there some kind of MK Ultra thing going on with you. You brought it to your mind. No other than the fact that I oh I might as well drop the news now yeah I am going to be I'm gonna be trying out to be Skip's new partner. I gotta get out of here and yeah outside of that nothing to be talking about. How are you talking or you don't know. You would actually be good on that so I could make that recommendation. You'd be good on that show. I want to switch up and throw you one throw you one last softball. Did you read the dead spin piece on you know Brittany Griner and and just the whole WNBA. The WNBA is being mistreated Steve because it's a black league. If there were pretty blonde white girls playing in the league that everyone ignored they'd be getting treated but they'd be getting treated like the US soccer women's soccer team because that was predominantly white girls and even though Megan Rapinoe and all them white girls are complaining that they're not getting treated well dead spin has concluded that they're pampered and treated well and and the WNBA players the reason no one likes them is because they're black and they're lesbian. This is I mean dead spin writes a lot of bad pieces this was one of the most disjointed illogical pieces I've ever read. Look the basketball is not that good. Too many of them are tattered up and look like dudes like Brittany. That's why no one's watching. It's just not that compelling a brand of basketball. It's predominantly black women dominating college basketball. They're not having a problem drawing attention and drawing ratings and you know they're not ain't nobody mistreated. Angel Reese it doesn't seem like but WNBA tattered up Brittany Griner you know talking about she hates America taking a knee during the national anthem. It's none of that it's if these were white girls everybody would love them. Well and not only that I don't want to repeat anything you said there's another issue they're perennial malcontents they complain too damn much and they're anti-US they're very unpatriotic and I think most of America's just done with them and aesthetically they're not nice to look at and it's not really a compelling entertainment capsule of time like I'll be honest with you Jason like when I watch women's softball I guess their World Series just ended I happen to be on the channel I actually don't like well mind watching it the women are nice looking they're very feminine and they could actually play ball and I like the pace of play so it's pretty entertaining to me in fact I like it more than baseball by the way. Your thing is the thing let's say a bunch of white guys started their own basketball league they said you know what we're not doing that NBA thing so let's say let's say we're gonna get all the whites and Asians and Latin guys because we know we're getting the NBA we're not good enough but we need to start our own league I am of the belief that me alongside everyone else we wouldn't watch that other league the white NBA we wouldn't watch that W because you know why because the play'd be so poor I don't want to see a bunch of reverse layups and 30 foot jumpers that cling off there I actually want to see the best athletes in the world play and I want to see some entertainment and I want to see things that I can't do athletically and that is one of the problems with the WNBA is that they have this sense of entitlement that just reeks of self-importance and it's not I don't think it's a racial thing because Jason if you look at the sports in America that we care about which for the most part is the NFL then college football then the NBA right for the and then baseball many of these sports are dominated by black and foreign athletes of color so that to me this whole argument and yes and Jason like the rest of America no I did not read Deadspend so you lost me there I did not read Deadspend I haven't read Deadspend in about dozen years let me move you into your real area of expertise gang warfare between the money team and the daddy team and I don't know what you got to break this down for me I can't even there was a brawl and then there's been tweets and Instagram posts this thing could get as messy as Biggie and Pop let's play seriously and you tell me if I'm wrong but let's play let's watch this little post fight or mid fight I don't know when this brawl happened but the Mayweather Gody brawl was pretty insane let's play the club oh they didn't even we don't even have the clip after the deal the fight spins out yes outside the ring break this down from it what should we think about this this looks serious to me well here's the thing that Mayweather Gody was actually more entertaining and competitive than when Mayweather actually fought our turtle gaddy look I don't I think you're making too much of it look if this was the 80s when John Gody was still John Gody maybe there's an issue here I don't know what to think this is something that's out of control I know people that worked that event there was way too many people that had credentials that were ringside that had no business being there and the security was very very lax what I found interesting yes was there a bit of a Mayweather camp against the gaudy camp yes but I have studied these things um these various social media posts like the zoopruder film I went through them frame by frame I took copious notes a lot of the fights were blacks against blacks jostlin her nandas was thrown hands I mean she was bobbin and weaving and I don't mean that about her hair um fights were breaking out all over the place between people it so it wasn't just like the italian's going against the blacks it didn't look like Bensonhurst in 1984 I'm sorry if you actually watch a lot of those social media things that were posted and I sent you a lot of them it seemed to me like there were other rivalries in play and I just wonder what gaddie uh excuse me was floyd is this worth it do you really need the money that bad to be involved in this because I because Jason I don't want to be cynical and I'm saying this to be gratuitous it's I'm actually a little bit surprised that there were no gunshots because you know how these things escalate people get disrespected they get hit they get hurt they get angry and bang bang bang and shoot out at the okay carol okay and if I'm a venue and I think that was in Miami somewhere in south florida if I am in building that hosts events on a regular basis and if main weathers crew calls about doing an exhibition I'd be like pass pass but I you know it is what it was it was fun and games and finally main weather was involved in a fight that I was actually entertained by so congratulations to him what about the threats to his daughter he don't think that's anything the threats to his daughter okay yeah yeah oh yeah yeah they're uh one of the baby mamas of uh NBA young boy I look I think that was completely out of line but do I do I think that I look I am not a expert on the mob okay but I get the sense that the gaddie or the gambito crime family I don't think they have quite the same influence I look I think it was completely ill advised it was out of line but do I think that yaya is in trouble she might be in no more trouble given who she hangs out with to begin with let's just be honest about it you've said a couple of different things though you see not a big deal but I'm shocked there was no gunplay I am and that's my wrong like no you're not wrong but that means it's a big deal and I mean the fact that it could lead to something I mean you sound like the people sound yeah big in pop that's just all for show that that's just to sell records until bodies started dropping I mean you look in if I was or I am like I have no interest in covering those events at all I'm not even against them I'm a capitalist so let people make their money uh let let there be the theory of supply and demand at play right those those novelty fights involving anybody I've never really gotten into them but there are more and more situations that happen at boxing events like anytime tank Davis fights something might set off because there's a track record of it it's been reported on I know people that have been there and so you better be careful where you go and unfortunately that event which is supposed to be just the fun exhibition everyone makes their money got completely out of hand um so do I think that now every Mayweather fight might be a powder keg I don't know it's hard it's hard to say to be honest with you but yeah I am actually surprised given how heated it got and how long some of those brawls and those fights took place why aren't we surprised that someone just said you know what now I'm going to take care of this and bring out their heat thank you Steve I'm gonna let you go you know I will say this this is an improvement over yesterday when I thought you clearly had your worst appearance ever with the comments

here in town she might as well make it make sense for me uh at the tony awards i don't know if you saw this shimika uh but i think her name's deni bitten cause why i'm the dentist a the grand wizard of the kkk i think we have the clip let's play it and while i am certain that the current grand wizard i'm sorry excuse me governor of my home state of florida will be changing to wild applause and so i mean first thing i think of i want you to make it is like people are like oh if we just move past trump they won't be calling the republican candidate a kkk person blah blah blah that we can really debate the issues if we just move past trump and now ron de santa's he he's a white supremacist as well right and this shows that black women maybe are the most educated but they're certainly not the most smartest or logical because why would you even get on a national stage and say this and how is it that so many people are celebrating her instead of rebuking her and telling her that this was inappropriate black women can do whatever they want play the race card play the the the female card there is no challenging them or correcting them at all what's the standard for being in the kkk i mean what what did oh he's against critical race theory right it being taught in school so and grooming for the kids he's against that as well and if he's a kkk grand wizard why would he want to change the name of plantation like wouldn't he want to leave that so it doesn't make any sense uh the white house in joe biden they welcomed the lgbtq the alphabet mafia to the white house and had a pride celebration that uh not surprisingly featured some nudity let's play the clip welcome to the lighthouse thank you happy pride month happy pride year happy pride life yay transgender children you are beautiful you are heard you belong understood you are loved and you belong oh the bravest and most inspiring people i've ever known and i mean you're welcome good folks can we take a little video hi mr president it is an honor trans rights a human right are we dropped this at the white house make that make sense well apparently the white house has come out and said that that was disrespectful oh they did yeah uh recently i guess in the last hour or two and saying that those people won't be invited back to any future events which i am happy about because i am sick of the alphabet mafia being able to get away with all of this lewd type of behavior just because they're gay and then joe biden standing up there saying this is the bravest most inspiring people he's ever met well if showing your boobs is brave then somebody need to double back 30 years and come give me my purple heart because what in the world you know and it just bothers me that this is allowed like i think mica we're great to you the presidential honor of freedom or the battle of freedom for your work at the kit cat club exactly because every time janet jackson's black cat came on the club was lit so i need some type of award and recognition and honor for that uh because this is crazy to me so i'm a little surprised that they came out and rebuked them and and said this that that is a small line in the sand but i'm just trying what do they expect if you stand on a stage and call people oh you're the most courageous the most honorable the most high integrity people and and all because of how you engage in sex or how you've chopped off or changed your genders that makes you the most courageous and honorable people in the world i mean all that pandering and yeah i can make sense of this is and i want you to react to the last part of this statement i'm telling their building a political block the democrats are of the lgbtq and their parents are going to be a part and here's the part i want you to react to the republicans over the next five years will be pandering just as hard to that voting block as the democrats are today yeah unfortunately i have to agree with you because they've already started just a little bit doing that you know with those who are acceptable you know the the alphabet mafia that they feel like aren't as out there or aren't as dangerous they're doing the same thing having events for them trump is honoring them at mara lago so the republicans will be on that road because they want to get votes and instead of standing on something they will fall for absolutely anything we're seeing it and yeah this i mean why did we expect these people to be at the white house to act with class when we know they are mentally disturbed is beyond me and so we're gonna go down that mentally disturbed path telling them yeah i know you're crazy i know you're a few french fries short of a happy meal but you're brave and most inspiring people you got a vote right have a vote and so that makes you very valuable listen i get it in terms of i want everybody to watch this show and and i couldn't really i don't want to know about your personal life or your sexual life i just want you to watch this show but i'm not going to change up anything that i say to make you feel more comfortable and so let's say you're someone like me and you struggle with gluttony i'm going to speak against gluttony i don't care if that makes me uncomfortable or any fat person watching the show uncomfortable i'm going to speak against it i'm going to speak against the whole alphabet mafia crew want you to watch the show but i'm going to tell you the truth about what i think about the alphabet mafia i i i i i get i don't want to silence people but i do want to let people know that their sexual preferences their sin doesn't make them special and i don't have to cater my positions around well that's that person's pet sin that's what they you know wit lot loves to eat a mcdonald so don't let me say a bad word about ronald mcdonald not gonna do it not here all right thank you shameka thank you for helping make it make sense uh charlie kirk all right welcome back we're honored to be joined by the founder and ceo of turning point usa host of the charlie kirk show charlie kirk uh charlie uh welcome to the show i i want to start thank you where i wasn't anticipating starting but you know hearing this news earlier in the day makes me think that pride month is going completely different than i anticipated today we learned that starbucks has instructed its locations to pull down pullback from their pride decorations throughout the store and and i think i said this last week and and now i think there's even more momentum i actually think we're winning in this culture war as it relates to pride we actually have some wind at our back is that the way you feel shockingly yes i mean the bad guys the enemy are they're finally showing some weakness some shame i didn't know they actually had some shame i thought it was all about pride no matter what we don't care about the cost evangelistic secular zeal i feel the same way and i'm equally as surprised because i mean i fight these people on campuses all the time and one of their rules is that you should never show any weakness you must be just belligerently ferociously aggressive at all times and but now you're seeing a new element which is in a weaker economy right jason with interest rates a little bit higher the economy a little bit more fragile stocks going down a little bit all of a sudden a different decision making matrix is entering which is hey guys yeah you know this whole pride thing is fine whatever but our stock is down 15 percent and we're no longer the number one beer or we're no longer able to compete against other companies because finally there is a consumer price to be paid and i think our side deserves a lot of credit we are starting to make decisions based on whether or not a company shares our values we're not all the way there yet jason once half the country truly starts to unify their purchasing power we're going to see even more stuff change so this is just the beginning stages but we're finally starting to see these otherwise untouchable companies start to be a little bit hesitant be a little bit fearful the starbucks one is shocking jason if there was one company that i did not expect any sort of wavering it would be starbucks they are notoriously one of the flag waivers literally of the pride agenda and yet even they're saying this is too much for us that means they're seeing an impact directly their profits and this ridiculous propaganda campaign that is nauseating that is over the top is finally starting to threaten some of this some of their corporate their corporate profitability and future i think we have to keep the pressure on and i'm finally seeing some momentum yeah i'm thinking that what happened to bud light and what happened to target clearly had an impact but i also think they probably must have some internal research that says like oh my god this could turn into a tsunami that this whole thing with sexualizing kids i'm sure they have data and have done research to like hey man parents and and normally progressive people are rejecting the sexualization of kids lives of tiktok and this whole social media put it in in people's face uh what you know what happened at the white house yesterday fly flying the pride flag i think they're all like oh my god we have finally gone too far yes and they have research beyond bud light and all that that says that well two thoughts number one i think people are disgusted when the white house is turned into a strip club when you have tranny's showing up and literally undressing that's not an exaggeration they're taking their clothes off at the white house i mean that that is a desecration and an insult to the people's house i think most ordinary american said like yeah that's not for me but jason i i think you're right but also wouldn't you love to be kind of a fly on the wall to hear the market research firm that they hired in the corporate boardroom uh yeah you know what coca cola guys it's not a good idea to support the castration of children wow we never would have thought that you know could you imagine like them sharing it in a corporate boardroom this stuff is obvious to you and i where i agree they probably have overwhelming amounts of data that pandering to a incredibly vocal aggressive minority is not a good way to get 80 of the country to buy your product the other thing that i find fascinating that i think you would be an expert in this regard because you do so much work with faith leaders the fact that the uh pushback isn't really coming from the church it's coming from believers that have started organizations like turning point usa point usa that work german boring in the daily wire the blaze and what we're doing the church isn't really the leader of this it's what believers have built outside the church that's the leader of this pushback and i was is that a good thing a bad thing or it doesn't matter who the leader is well it's certainly necessary it's and i think you're exactly right we're seeing this kind of new generation of christian entrepreneurs that are building big and bold and beautiful things to fulfill Psalm 97 10 which is the love god and hate evil that if you love god you must hate evil and this is something modern christianity has done a very poor job of modern christianity has written some extremely good music i listened to it they do a lot of good rock concerts they put on things that are closer to a ted talk than actually preaching the word of god they have they're really good at parking cars at mega churches and serving coffee and lobbies of big churches not too good at hating evil but that is a component we are called to hate evil in fact jesus himself confronted the demonic and and using using obviously as authority as the son of god and part of the godhead excommunicating the demonic we are called to also fight that evil and i don't think the american church is even contested in that arena so you look at the blaze you look at daily and turning point usa three great examples we are kind of filling the void where a lot of church and jason parachurch ministries are not fighting i mean there are a lot of these parachurch ministries you could think of young life or campus crusade or calove and they do good work but are they really fighting against the trans agenda are they really communicating to their audience about the grooming of children no they say we we're not political and we don't take stances on that i think that's a vanilla cop out this is a biblical spiritual battle where they are going after children this is not republican or democrat no no this is good and evil and if the church and parachurch ministries aren't going to stand up then a new generation of believers and spirit filled entrepreneurs are going to build things to be able to fill that void so i'm encouraged jason because the old way of doing things of pastors that used to do cop outs and i mentioned them a lot you know kind of these nice guy pastors happy talk pastors their their time is over their congregations are shrinking their ministries are really evaporating they're not finishing well and now it's time for us to rebuke this evil that is the new pagan secular religion let's be very clear jason there is no such thing as a religionless society in america you just replace christianity with a counterfeit religion that looks very similar to the earth worship to the worship of self that the bible was actually originally written as a refutation of the first five books of moses what we call the panatuk or the torah was at war with pagan polytheism worship of self worship of earth worship of sexual behavior and now we're just seeing the kind of old gods resurrected and we call it pride trolley so turning point does a lot of work with pastors and ministers you get them together and have how are they receiving your message in this new more aggressive strategy that the ministers you're dealing with are they hopping on board or are you having to put a are you having to pride them or wow like put a bird in their saddle or what do you do to a cattle to move it still with a prod any how are they receiving your message overwhelmingly positive look i mean there's there's detractors and there's naysayers they don't like to confront me directly i wonder why they're always welcome on my show to you know i would love to have a conversation with them they just call me names they call me a christian nationalist whatever that means and but we had a 1,100 pastors in wives Jason at our event in Nashville was the largest pastor summit of its kind we have another one coming up in San Diego love that you you know teach them something they could learn a lot about what's happening from you and look what we're learning from our pastors what we're learning from doing this with pastors is that there is a hunger and there's an appetite and so there's a couple questions we ask to pastors and believers that are not convinced number one what in your life should Jesus not be in charge of and they say oh Jesus should be in charge of everything i said okay that includes your political decisions that includes how you view culture right you don't all of a sudden compartmentalize your christianity it should be comprehensive so everything to who you marry to what music you listen to to how you act your faith must inform all those things the second thing is hey when you're 14 when a 14 year old young lady in your church comes up to you as a senior pastor and asks hey i'm thinking of becoming a girl do you say we don't do that because we're not political or do you love that 14 year old enough to give her the truth and take stands from the pulpit and in private to be able to preach biblical truth what we are seeing is pastors that are cowards at times because they do not want to say the things that the world does not want them to say but i'm here to say that there's an incredibly promising movement of pastors and it's not centralized this is not like from straight from the top of the central the south southern baptist convention it's not straight from some sort of denomination this is word of mouth this is one by one by one of pastors that are gaining um that are joining kind of our movement and our ask is really simple we don't want money from you we're not here have you joined some membership or we want you to be courageous that's my ask i want you to be courageous and we will have your back if you decide to do so i'm gonna say one more thing it'll be somewhat phrased as a question i'm more want your reaction but it's i'm almost feeling like we're in the midst of a different kind of revival and and again it's coming from outside the church but it is Christian entrepreneurs that are trying to do exactly what you talk about us exactly what we talk about on this show all the time is like no let's let the bible and god inform everything we do let's let's don't just because they want to have separation of church and state doesn't mean we have to have separation of church and mindset and so this feels like a revival and i'm telling i'm sitting here in the middle of pride month i came into it with expectation like man it's gonna be a war it's gonna be messy and it's like man this is almost like uh you're young i don't know if you remember operation or racky freedom or whatever and they we went over there or desert storm and everybody just surrendered as soon as we hopped out of planes and we're like yeah i can't wait to surrender to you that's almost kind of how i feel that we're in this is kind of the revival we all keep looking for is actually maybe happening yeah i i pray you're right but we have to stay faithful and we have to keep working and we have to keep our duty i mean look pride is a sin and you will fall if you embrace pride literally and this entire movement will their whole movement will fall so we have to say humble in front of the lord and we have to keep our spiritual disciplines first which is to fast and to pray for our nation and to pray for our leaders and to do the right thing regardless of how overwhelmingly daunting it might seem and i think we're going to see a Galatians 3 revival Jason which is different than other revivals where it says very clearly in Galatians 3 that the law is a school teacher to christ so the civil and moral law that is outlined in exodus numbers Leviticus and Deuteronomy which inspired the american founders can actually be a school teacher to christ as paul wrote in the letter to Galatians what do i mean by that that means that when people start to see a system that's falling apart like this trans stuff like open borders they're going to naturally gravitate to conservative principles and we're seeing this in the gallop poll Jason the country's becoming more center right but once you start drinking from the streams of liberty you're going to want to find its ultimate source which is Jesus christ that liberty is not man's idea it is god's idea and what we are seeing and we've had this hypothesis for a couple years and i was laughed at by rick warren i was called names by people like andy stanley and levi lusco and these other weak need skinny jean pastoring you know cowards that are out there where they say oh you'll never win people over by talking politics they are wrong Jason people actually want order in every form of life and guess what you know the religion new service syndicated by the washington post publish an article about us where they said people come to the tp usa faith events for the politics and they leave as christians that is the opposite of everything that we are told we are told that you can't do that that politics can never not be nothing you know ever helpful that's not for everybody but some people for example see boys becoming girls and borders wide open and post-birth abortion and they might have never had a good experience with religion but all of a sudden they come into a tp usa faith event and we teach them hey do you want a country or civilization where truth is the ultimate principle and they say yes well eventually that is going to lead you to christ because the iron law of christianity is the iron law of the universe it all points back to the logos which is john one which is that our universe has a harmony has a rhythm and eventually that will lead you to the truth which is jesus christ trolley kirk is fearless that's awesome let me ask you a couple of more politically explicit question before i i let you go uh the hunter biding audio tapes are they going to be a big deal or are they going to just be ignored by corporate media and it's no harm no file we ignore anything on hunter's laptop we were going to ignore these audio tapes that Chuck grasley's talking about it's just going to be a big deal or no deal i don't know because i i would just guess i mean there's one of two things that are happening here jason number one they're going after trump super hard because i was they hate him but they're also trying to create the preconditions to go after biden and replace him maybe with camila harris or gavin newson very suspiciously a lot of outside groups just started started spending a ton of money uh propping up camila harris that's something to keep your eye on but it's all speculation and all guessing i will be honest with you though jason i'm incredibly cynical when it comes to holding the biden crime family accountable i don't even like talking about it on my show because it just sounds so repetitive and i don't like complaining i think complaining is really bad because it's like every day oh wow they're getting money from this country what country have they not received a wire transfer from i mean it's like tansa nia eastern ukraine kazikstan china they might eventually catch up to them i hope there is some corporate media coverage of it i'm not keeping my hopes up but look the american democrat party right now seems to not care very much but creating this kind of prerequisite that now all of a sudden presidents are not off limits i it's possible they indict hunter and joe biden sometime soon but i see no indications that that's gonna happen so where are you at on donald trump obviously you probably like most of us think these 37 felony charges are a joke but where you at on do you want him to be the republican nominee in 24 i do i've endorsed him and he's a friend of mine and i think you said this on tucker karlson's program when he used to have a show you know a couple months ago jason where you're like i'm full maga now that they're coming after him with full force and that really resonated with me look there is an attachment that i think a lot of the country has because they're feeling persecuted because of their faith because of their politics and they feel now when they see donald trump being booked with 37 felony indictments they have something in common with donald trump that they too finally have someone who's also now being persecuted wrongly for their beliefs look donald trump has flaws but he also has a lot of virtues he's courageous he works as tail off he loves the country he was an excellent president i totally understand when people voice their flaws their frustrations and their feedback but i asked them to also be equally intellectually honest is there anything good about them and is there anything that he did when he was president that was admirable or noteworthy and finally i'll say this him and a republican primary he's basically unbeatable right now these indictments help him the vibe of the republican base understands is an us versus them type you know let's just say um dichotomy right now and then going into a general election um donald trump has to basically win three states wisconsin arizona and georgia i don't think these indictments are going to hurt him nearly as much as they hope to donald trump has an opportunity to use this to his benefit and as a positive there's no guarantee he will he is an opportunity to make an argument that our government has slid so far out of control over the last 100 years post woodrow wilson to create an out of control administrative state and that he is the one to represent the citizens of the country from becoming serfs no guarantee he'll do this but personally jason the more they attack him the more i like him the more my support of him grows because i have nothing but contempt for this unchecked fourth branch of government this leviathan who thinks they get to choose our leaders the only thing that ever crossed my mind about trump and moving off of trump was like well if because i and i made the argument a few times on the show maybe a year ago that like well if we forced the left to actually defend their positions and not just shout the name trump and actually if trumps out of the way they actually have to defend their positions that their positions all fall apart and they look crazy but now that i'm watching them uh and we we played a clip earlier today in today's show where some woman at the tony awards is calling ronda santis the grand wizard of the kk k and and so it just more solidly puts me in the trump camp because it doesn't matter who they put up against gavin newson kamala hairs or joe biden they're going to frame that person they'll frame me as the kk k though frame larry elder is the kk k if luice faircon was the president or was the president's candidate for the republic he would be the kk k and so you know what i'm just going to stick with trump because they hating i love him there's a reason they hate him and the more they hate him the more i love him amen and in a world of the hyper-feminization of society and alpha male masculine figure is desperately needed right now the administrative state hates him he is a threat to them i support him a hundred percent trolley thank you for the time i will be joining you out in san diego look forward to it look forward to engaging with you and the minister so i'll see you in san diego at the latest god bless you jason thank you so much thank you all right uh that's tomorrow we'll see you tomorrow sitting on the corner never been on a wreck and my back for free we are living get back we are receiving all the seed when we all want to be free but we want free to i just want i want to be i just want i want to be i just want i want to be i just want i want free i want free"
