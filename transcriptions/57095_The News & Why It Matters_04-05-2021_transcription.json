    "text": " Today, Joe Biden says if you make less than 400,000 a year, you're not going to pay a single penny in taxes. Congratulations to all of you. You don't have to pay taxes this year. Also, the White House is preparing to confront states on what they call anti trans bills. We've got a lot coming up and it starts right now. Hey, welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez today joined by two of my good friends, Elijah Shafer, host of slightly offensive that you can see on Blaise TV. Also subscribe on YouTube. Did you? Did you? I did. Did you ask me your pronouns? I didn't ask you your pronouns. I thought of them already. What? What are your pronouns, Elijah? Thanks for asking, Sarah. It's actually just two letters. It's F slash U and it's none of your business. I just, I just, I identify as letters. Yeah, give me a shot. I want to write. You're a cuckooian. Yes. What's the cuckooian show? If you ask me for my pronouns, I may punch you. I'm a man. Can you not tell? Can you not tell? You know what I, you know what I want. Call me man. No. Oh my God. What's up, man? Man. Hey, man. Yes. Right. Okay. So while we're on the subject of this, I do have to bring up. There was a, this viral video I saw you posted. I know you saw it. I don't know if you saw Yaku, this viral video that was going all around Twitter of this little girl who was talking to her mom. They were like out of playground and her mom was like, Oh, do you feel like a boy? Sometimes, oh, well, you don't, what are you? Oh, you don't know what you are. I mean, just total and complete child abuse. And every single person when I retweeted it, every single person who said something negative to me, they all had pronouns in their bio, all of them. And I'm like, you are some 20 something in your mother's basement and you have pronouns in your bio. I don't think you need to tell me how to raise children. That's my, mental illness. You know with the pronouns that there's a mental illness because it's also narcissism. Yeah. Because if you think that people actually like online that are virtual care about what you go by and you have like self importance issues and probably unlikely you have trauma in your life because I got always safe when you got in the shower and you looked down today. Hopefully you did take a shower and you didn't know your pronouns were just by looking down. Then we have a problem. We have a problem. It's a mental illness. Yeah. There's a massive psychosis. It's true. I know Elijah knows that firsthand just from being at all the protests and the chats and all the places you've been. By the way, people identify as a tree now. That's like a real thing. It's an action new pronoun to identify as a tree. Yeah. Identifying as like as objects now. And one user said that's because and I like that because they're just trying to branch out so we should get in credit. Trees are positive impact. So at least we're going somewhere. Yeah. The first image that came to me is just dogs go pee on trees. I wonder what they do when they stand in a dog just says you're a tree. Right. Let's go. Let's try and branch out. Don't. Sorry for hijacking your show Sarah. Yeah. So we're not here to talk about the news. No worries. So Joe Biden. Joe Biden was you know he says things sometimes that I'm not sure if he wants to say I'm not sure if he knows what day it is. I'm not sure if he knows who he is. You are Joe Biden, the President of the United States. He was speaking when was this yesterday and speaking on the economy and taxes and he made a jaw dropping statement that if you make less than $400,000 a year, you're not going to pay a single penny in taxes. Listen, the reason I'm bothering to do this is I keep hearing on the press Biden is going to raise your taxes. Anybody making less than $400,000 or will not pay a single penny in taxes. Wow. We will not increase the deficit either. Unlike the last gigantic tax cut, which increased the deficit by $2 trillion. It's about balancing the system. Now I see now I see why he is in fact America's most popular president of all time because he was going to reduce our taxes to zero. If I didn't know that I would have voted for him. Gee, practically 99% of the population are going to pay no taxes. I'm going to vote. I'm going to vote for him. I want to say this. If that happens and you give me back 30% of my paycheck, I can start affording to invest in the programs that might actually turn the country around. I don't even care about the presidency anymore because that meant 30%. I think the average person is probably going to get 17% to 30% of their money back. I have to say I hope this gaff because they say he's not losing it and that he just has a stutter and that wasn't a stutter. That must be true. Well, no because Snopes has already come out and they give him the benefit of the doubt that they would never ever dare to President Trump. So much room. So much leave. Yeah, President Trump is saying something you know what he means and they're like, nope. He said that counts of one of his false claims. But Snopes says Biden clearly misspoke you guys when he said that people make a difference. And he's making less than 400,000 will not pay a single penny in taxes. He clearly misspoke. What is it then? Is it 40 or is it four? Well, it's interesting. Is it 40,000 or is it four? I mean, you know, what are we talking about? It's interesting because they've already had to backtrack on this. You know, you had Jen Psaki come out and say, well, I mean, yes, we said 400,000, but that was for families, not individuals. That was just for families. So it's 200,000 per person now all of a sudden. So we're getting all of this conflicting information. The sad part is it's still none of it is going to pay for any of the all the programs that they have. I mean, look, I just saw today that a town used $228,000 of COVID relief to install a squid statue by the day. I'm just from the New York Post. Like, you know, when you talk about like with taxes, I also understand my brother came here and he said, you guys, your roads are pretty messed up in Texas. And believe me, it's the drivers are messed up too. But you could fix one of them with tax money. The other one, I don't know. But he goes, you don't want just like a one or 3% state tax in order to fix the roads. And I said, if the government worked for the people, I wouldn't mind that. Right. But because I know that it'll be 3% this year, 10% in 10 years, and then we'll be up to California, which is nearly 100%. And if you're asking me, like, it really is that bad at this point. Like, when I was there, I was paying over 50% in my taxes between federal, state and corporate, just saying that it's like, when this guy is saying about even raising taxes, which we know he's doing for the $200,000 earners, it's like, the reason why we're pissed is not because we just hate the idea of taxes. It's because the more that you take, the less we see being done. Well, right. Yeah, because to your point, Elijah, it's not just that, okay, 3% and then they're going to gradually raise it. It's that then the contracts will go to, you know, so-and-so's best friend who has an end. And they're going to charge way too much because they know that the taxpayers are paying for it. And if you just went private and got government and big, you know, big bureaucratic business out of it, I'm sure you'd be able to get all of this at a much lower cost. But you don't want to do that because you're playing with someone else's money. Yeah, but inherently, I think that's the problem with the tax system in the US, right? Yeah. Especially in a lower income bracket, let's talk schooling, for instance. You can't see where your money's going and that's the problem. I mean, just to send it to us and then you hear it's on a cash on a plane flying to a foreign country. But we're helping another country to look down in the shower and figure out what their gender is. So we've got to pay them to look down. The Pakistan really, really confusing the shower. Exactly. So that's the problem, though, is when you pay your taxes, like California, Californians are the people in this country that should be the most irate about, listen, wait a second. You know, we're bankrupt. That net state is the most bankrupt state and they pay the highest taxes. Think for a second, you don't think there's a little corruption, little much, you know, maybe at the top. You know, so that's, and to your point, if you could trace it and you can actually see, hey, the potholes are being filled. Hey, and you know, the lane is being, hey, school schools are being upgraded, whatever, then one thing. But interesting to me, though, is he said another thing. Look, 200,000, 400,000. I don't care what it is. Oh, it's not going to increase the deficit. There's no way. The man just flat out, the left just flat out can't do math. We're not going to increase the deficit. We're going to let 99% of Americans earn under $400,000 a year. Okay. That is the ultra 1%. Okay. But it's not going to increase the deficit. No way. This is going to let, oh, Jeff pays us pay it all. Oh, who's going to pay all the taxes all of a sudden? And if it is 200,000 and lower still, I mean, it's, but let's go to the moving for family. But what stops it from moving, though? That's what I want to explain is that this is the goalpost and the problem with taxes to where it becomes state enforced robbery. And that already is what taxes are. But when it comes to a point where it's like, that's why they say, well, why do you defend the rich? Why are you defending the rich? I don't like people who use dishonest means to make money, but I don't believe in punishing people who use honest means to earn a living. They employ a lot of people. But then at the same time, it's like, well, why are you defending not over taxing rich people? I'm like, no, no, no. I'm defending not over taxing people. Right. Just realizing that we are not an empty, you know, I mean, a wallet that never ends for somebody to put their hands in and take money out of because see who it was, the billionaires, then it was the millionaires, then it's the above 400,000, then it's above the 200,000. And it will creep and creep in because the government has no self control. Because there's no way not to increase the deficit, you know, the way they spend, are you out, are you kidding me? Even if they say it's $200,000 a family, I mean, there's no- All these new pens for the impeachment. Yeah. So custom pens. I mean, not so stupid. They're spending like crazy. They're sending money to foreign countries who, one, aren't our allies, number one. And they're basically funding an immigration, you know, debacle, right? Sending money to countries south of border, not saying, hey, take care of your own. No, basically we're going to fund you to bring them over here and it taxes the system, whether it's money tax or whether it's a tax on health care, on the state of the nation by having people come in, they spend like crazy. So it's just funny to me that you guys, we won't increase the deficit. Okay. So I think that like really when you're trying to look at what the root of the problem is here and why the American people are so apt to just jump on board with, oh, well, yeah, no, the rich need to pay their fair share and that's how all this is going to work. I think that the average American person just does not understand how taxes work period because they're getting it deducted from their paychecks. They don't see how much is deducted. They just kind of are like, oh, yeah, there's a lot of writing here. Okay, here's my take home money and they don't get it, I think. So what is the answer? Because I'm all in favor of just doing away with all of that. No, don't do any deductions. Every single American pay quarterly taxes. Write that check. You have to write that check. You have to add it up. You know how much you have to write every quarter. You write that check to the IRS and you send it in the mail just like I do, by the way. And I got to tell you, it frickin' stings a lot. Yes. And I feel like if every American did that and went, oh, crap, that's actually how much I'm paying. I'm making, you know, $50,000, $75,000 and I'm paying this much money. Okay, yeah, maybe we do it all. All Americans should have to pay taxes. Yes. I don't think there should be an exemption. Even it should be percentage equivalent to your income because it hurts the same. And I think that's why people vote on raising the taxes because too many people don't pay them. And so it's like, well, what does it do for me? I mean, I'm still going to get the same handouts. I'm going to get the same government programs, the same access to school. Exactly. And so they don't have that concept in their head of saying, this is money the government is wasting that people could be investing into our local economy and could be buying things. Like if I didn't pay taxes, I could own a really nice house, then I could pay people to remodel it. And this and that. People don't realize those are jobs for carpenters and people who do tile. And that's also for the furniture companies. And you can invest it, but the government takes so much money away that you actually get really limited in your ability to invest that money back in to the land, even in stocks or crypto or whatever you're using. You can't, that money's, yeah, it's going to Pakistan. So that... Exactly. Muslims can... And look at... It's no different than a company running their, running the company poorly and punishing the employees for it. Right? This is what it is. The country is a company, which is why we had a businessman run it well. But I'm for a flat tax, a flat tax, pick a percentage, you know, publicly 10%, 15% pick it, okay? Maybe 10 to 15%. But I don't care if you're homeless, if you aren't, two dollars, you're going to pay 20 cents. Every American pays a flat tax, a balanced system, because you can't keep taxing the individuals who work their tiles up. This overnight success story, and someone was just dealt the right cards or whatever. No, people who are successful work their tiles up. And all of a sudden you go, okay, three quarters of society don't have to pay taxes. And you boys who did well or girls who did well, you got to cover them, all right? No, I'm with you. When it starts hurting, when everybody starts playing, you're going to see culture change quite a bit. That whole entitlement mentality is going to go because it's going to sting. Yeah, I mean, well, and I think- You got skin in the day. Right, it's very similar to healthcare. And I know a lot of people, including Rand Paul, have put forward proposals that are like, hey, we should do health savings accounts. Like do away with all of these, you know, the way that it's set up now. And let's do health savings accounts. And then you can become the consumer and you can shop around and you have this amount of money that you have put aside. And then you can decide if Walgreens or Walmart or Target or wherever has a drug that is the lowest cost. And once you start paying and it's your dollar that is affected, I just feel like all of a sudden, Americans are- Isn't that how you would raise your children? You'd give them a budget and say, hey, balance the budget. You know what, you say that, but I think that that is something that has been lost with a lot of American families. Absolutely. They don't teach their children that. I spoke to my six-year-old two days ago and I said, Oren, our next vacation, not this year, but next year, you're going to be seven. So I'm going to give you a budget. You're going to plan the family vacation. It's not really me. And I go, yeah, but you're going to have so much money and you're going to plan this whole thing. And then what's going to happen is she's going to quickly spend and go, well, we can't eat. The next three days we can't eat. Why that? Because we needed the budget. Where's that art of teaching? How many players do you see in the NFL that can't balance the checkbook? Sign a $10 million signing bonus. No idea. It's a complete lost art. Yeah. I mean, and so therefore entitlement, well, somebody will pay. In the credit cards, I just want to point that out. That's what I was laughing when I saw a commercial recently. We're giving your kid a credit card and I'm going, talk about not teaching people the right things. It's like, here's an endless card with like a limit for a child. What happened? You get 10 bucks for the week. I didn't get any allowance, but I mean, I did teach people something. I love the launch. I made the money. I mean, I had to. I painted houses. Right. Right. I mean, I scooped ice cream, man. And then you have that dollar and you protected. Yeah. I flip like nobody's taking this off. Yeah. What? You flip burgers? Nice flip laptops. I would just buy broken laptops. Really? I just buy quality pictures overachiever. I'm here. Oh, I just made the program. I just made the book. I just made the book. I just made the book. Work again. Okay. Overachiever. Go to commercial. We've got more to come, including the White House preparing to confront states on what they call, I like to just say what they call because they call them anti-trans bills, but that's really not what they are. But first we want to thank our sponsor, Candid. If you are unhappy with your smile, do what I did. Go to Candid. They have the clear, comfortable aligners that just they just fit right in your mouth. They are practically invisible and they will straighten your teeth very quickly, very easily. I'm saying like maybe half the cost of braces. Braces are way more expensive and with Candid you can do it all from home. So they ship you everything. You do the impressions. You send them back and they send you your kit with everything you need step by step by step and you just wear those aligners two weeks, trade them out, get the next one and it works. Maybe you are like I am and I had braces, a lot of braces as a kid and then I stopped wearing my retainer when I was done with it and my teeth shifted as an adult and I was like how in the world did I do that for all those years and I have crooked teeth again. You don't have to do that. Go to Candid. Get those teeth straightened. You can go to CandidCO.com slash Y. Use promo code Y to get $75 off. It is CandidCO.com slash Y promo code Y. For the Biden administration is going to confront the rash of anti LGBT and specifically anti trans bills proliferating in state legislatures. This is an exclusive according to the Daily Beast. And yeah, so Human Rights Campaign says that the White House is going to confront this. The DOJ is preparing to challenge in the courts, in the courts the legality of the bills that have been introduced and some passed in a number of states. Now I want you to pay attention very carefully to how they frame this because I think that the language that they use is so important. Outlying transgender youth access to healthcare and sports. So that's apparently what these states are doing. Stuck to your kids. Right. Right. But they're outlying transgender youth access to healthcare. It's the word no one's doing that. No one's doing that. It's like when they talked about the South Lake when again critical race theory of how I mostly white city fought against anti racist curriculum and you're going oh my. Yes, that's like I caught myself here. But he goes, this is something. I think it's so counts if you spell it out. Oh man, I tried. At least God knew my heart was right. But the censors didn't. But it's like, you know, the way they word it is to make anybody who disagrees with them like somebody who's against human rights and against progress. We're not against progress. We're against your progressive propaganda, which is not pushing us forward. It's leading to the exploitation of children and the degradation of American society by teaching kids not only to hate their country, but to deny their own gender and to think that that's normal and it will never be normal. And even if it's hateful for me to say that on the show, it isn't. And it's one thing different for adults to choose to do things with their body, even if I would advise against it. But when you're talking about children who are unimpressionable, I just read a story today where a 14 year old was being charged as a pedophile for having sex with his 12 year old girlfriend in Houston because they were saying, well, even though they're so close and age that the girl is 12 and when you're 12, you're so impressionable. We can't give a 12 year old, even if they're within the same three years, the right to have sex. Oh, so this 12 year old is too impressionable to have sex with a 14 year old boyfriend, but to, you know, get, you know, irreversible hormone therapy and to move towards pre pre op miscectomy and to use this. Oh, that's normal. It's like, it's just you can't even make a logical argument for that. Yeah, no, and look, the 12 year old is a victim, 100%, 79, you can't draw that line. It doesn't matter where, what, how, this is the world I live in every single day. We fight this fight every day. But the irony here is every single bill you're talking about, whether it's State Bill 145 Gavin Newsom, whether it's 22 18, Gavin Newsom and Inslee, all these bills that bring in these progressive sexualization of children, they all come in under transgender equity fund, transgender health care. So when it's convenient for them, all of a sudden there's no problem with health care. We'll just slip in this curriculum, you know, and then if you dare say, well, hold on one second, you know, you're one lying to the people. This is not about transgender health care at all. This is about inter-actor nation to the components of sex aid curriculum or whatever it is or, you know, the sterilization of America's children through puberty blockers, right, at age three in California, then it's convenient. And now if we dare to stand up and say, hey, hold on one second, you know, we're not against, you have your rights. Okay, it's in the Constitution. It's there. The stuff you say you fight for, it's already there. You are indoctrinating other people. If you want to go be a monkey and go behave like a monkey, do it. But when you start legislating that all the kids in your city, because if you now need to think they're a monkey or need to think that, hey, maybe I'm not a boy, not a girl, allow these things to happen. Or the worst thing that's happening in our country is take what's called sexual agency away from the parent. This is California now. So when a three year old says, hey, maybe I am a boy because our auntie or someone says, hey, are you sure? Are you sure like that mother? The parents lose sexual agency, which means CPS and Planned Parenthood now says parent, you stand aside. Little Susie used three can now get Luprin, which is a prostate cancer drug to sterilizer indefinitely. So we make sure the chicken cross over easier when she's 18. All this stuff happens under healthcare. So when they start talking transgender and healthcare, your antenna should go way up. They abuse that system every bill on every floor across this country where they brought these laws into sexualized children come in under the healthcare, something healthcare related. It's just nonsense. It's evil. I mean, it's just downright evil. You know, you see how they treated the Georgia law to secure and, you know, make sure that the elections were fair and secure. And from them, it's a voter suppression bill. The voter suppression bill. I mean, everything they're doing, they're just controlling the language and they're pushing the narrative that way. And it's just so frustrating to see. Okay. So before we go, I do want to bring up there's a picture just going all over the internet. For those of you conspiracy theorists, you're going to love this one. So this is, of course, the Biden's with the Carter's. But if you'll notice, the Biden's are either giants or the Carter's have been miniature people this entire time. And we just never knew it. With it. It appears to be that the Carter's are mini sized because their chairs are tiny. Everything around them is tiny except for the Biden's who genuinely look like giants next to them. I'm not. I mean, so you're, you're the conspiracy theorists that I thought would just go off. Pictures like this. And you know, I think it's, you were to tell me this is like 14 millimeters or 12 millimeter with a slight, with a slight rounded lens because you're trying to get a good aperture. So trying to get a lot of light in the distortion on the ends. It could make them look larger. Also considering the fact that they might be a little more in front of them than you think with the distortion, because you already see that the one side of his face is heads already starting to go in smaller. But also there's never something with this administration that doesn't look like he's like a hologram or something. It's like if you have to prove like when fact checkers came out and had to tell the American people fact check false Joe Biden is not a hologram is not the fact that they think America's that dumb. But the fact that we're at a point in our country where you have to reassure the people that presidents not a hologram shows you just how popular this president really is. Hey, there's a lot going in around at the moment and this is fact with Putin has doubles and they talk about doubles and this is well reported around the world. They're going, hey, is this the real Biden is this Biden number four Biden number five look that picture by itself is just disturbing. It's disturbing. I love you. It's absolutely disturbing. I mean you should look at that and go, I love it. Holy Hannah, what's going on? Maybe they want to make him look larger than life. Biden is really a giant nation. He's really not a midget. I would like to also say I know that there were some people who were like, but if you look at the leaf, the top leaf on her dress, it's coming out from the yeah, that's the way that the that's the way that the dress is. If you go and look, it's got like this artificial leaf that like for the 3D effect, I guess, is sticking out. And by the way, I totally love the fact that Joe Biden is wearing a mask outside in conditions where he doesn't have to. He's around people who are approximately 250 years old and would be in the vulnerable category for this virus does not wear a mask at all. But he's just playing with her. But again, I don't mind but like make up your mind. Look at that. No, no, if you're talking about wearing a mask, they're don't wear the mask outside. Looks like a set. It is a set. Are you kidding me? It is a set. But he's just doing this is following. Thank you. That's you. I was waiting for. That's right. He's following the playbook because he's doing exactly what Cuomo did. He sent COVID into the old age home. Right. He sent it into the, you know, kill the people. So he goes mask outside. But when I go see the Carter's, mask off. It's just bizarre. I mean, because they know they know what's really going on. They know. I hear the circus. It's just me. Do you hear the circus? The circus music. Boswell and Wookiee and the ringleader steps in every day. It's a top pad. And then at that. Yeah, it's a ringleader. It's a circus show, man. It's an absolute. The product comes out walking on like a little like colored ball. You know, I just go and he's like, I believe it. I'm getting trolled. I want you to see it's a present with elephants and tutus. That's what you're going to see next. It's a complete circus show. The world must be looking at us and go, what a joke. Yes. It's a giant episode of punk. That's what it feels like. Like the action culture, someone's going to come out and be like, just kidding. This was a prank. Yeah, I got you. Oh, Lord, I wish. I wish. All right. We've got more to come first. We want to thank our sponsor Freedom Project Academy. So, you know, we're talking about what your kids are being taught in public school. Yaquah was talking about the curriculum that they're doing. He's very, very involved in that. You know, there's no difference between boys and girls. You guys are, you're white, so you're racist. Also math is racist. And supporting Black Lives Matter and social justice. I just wish that when I was back in school, I could just say that math was racist because I did not too great at math. I was not able to use that as an excuse. And I think I mode some reparations is all I'm saying. So reading and writing, you don't need to worry about that. Just the leftist organizations and agendas. And then, of course, teachers unions just got tens of billions in COVID cash to push all of this in your public school classrooms. I know you don't want this for your kids. Okay. If you wanted it for your kids, you would not be watching this program, but you're watching this program. So you need to consider Freedom Project Academy. All right. FBA has perfected live online learning. For over a decade, they are built on Judeo-Christian values. They have a classical curriculum and they are dedicated to providing mastery of subject matter, not leftist propaganda. You got to go to freedomforschool.com.

All right. A juror who served on the trial of a police officer, Derek Chauvin, is he's defending his decision to attend a Black Lives Matter rally in Washington, D.C. back in August. Now this is kind of goes contradictory to his statements during the juror selection process. He said that the demonstration had nothing to do with George Floyd. So the Black Lives Matter demonstration that they had in D.C. that you know, I mean, it was like in the name of George Floyd apparently had nothing to do with George Floyd, which is kind of hard to fit together here. But there's a picture. Who was it that found this picture? Was it Jack Passobic? No, it was not. I mean, that's a post millennial article that he's getting it from. So, I mean, it looks like it was a post. It must have been told. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It must have been post millennial, but they're good. They are very good. This was posted on his Facebook page. If you're watching this podcast, you get your knee off our next BLM. This has been out for some time though. Yes. So that's why I'm wondering where everyone else was with this. Have you seen all the jurors? I've seen interviews with a lot of jurors. I just watched one even right after where one of the females says that her home was in Brooklyn center during the riots and the riots were constantly on her mind that just happened with the Dante right and that she definitely had some fear of if she did the wrong verdict that people would come to her house and you go, despite what you think, it's like these this is clearly not an impartial jury. This was already predetermined. And this guy saying, oh yeah, well, I was just about black justice. It's like, bro, this is what we're supposed to accept is not reality. It's like, we know what this whole BLM movement started and gained momentum. But the media won't care about this because they don't care about impartiality about justice. They got the verdict they wanted. The mob got their way. And that's again about the flaunting. It's like now they're like, yes, it's not even enough for them. The verdict is not enough for them because it was never a bad George Floyd is about them. But it's a further breakdown in the justice system because if you know how it works, you know, Chauvin's lawyers get to cross examine the jurors and they could go, you know, strike it down. This put it to I'm wondering what work was done. Why? How did that pass? How did they go? Listen, you lived in that riot torn place. You've made these statements. You've posted these kind of things. Well, yeah, I don't know how much time or access they have to social media because all I can say is that this particular. Because that would not happen. That it would be struck down. I mean, you have that as a defense. You can you interview the jurors and you can you can you can strike them down from being on the jury. So this particular juror, they asked a couple different questions related to these demonstrations. Did you or someone close to you participate in any of the demonstrations or marches against police brutality that took place in Minneapolis after George Floyd's death? And then other than what you have already described above, if they answered to that question, have you or anyone close to you participated in protests about police use of force or police brutality? He answered no to both of them. And he's like, well, that demonstration that I attended with the knee on the neck shirt was just like it was for Martin Luther King. It wasn't for it. See, there's Martin Luther King on his shirt. Did you just say he was interviewed too? No. That he gave he was like, which is okay, I'm going to say something and I don't want people to misconstrue it. It's going to be very unpopular, but it's also makes actually makes me agree with the left about reforming the justice system. They talk about the justice system being racist. And that actually is kind of true because originally when they talked about a jury of the peers, that was probably majority white men on the jury. So they would say that, you know, a lot of black men were not allowed to serve black people at a certain point. And so they would look at and say, this is why it's racist because when a white person, a white man's getting judged by a bunch of white men, they're going to be more understanding culturally, racially, everything. But if a black man's being judged by a bunch of white men, then there's going to be that division and they people saw that division, that problem of not understanding the culture. And what's interesting is we become more diverse. We've never looked at that phrase, a jury of your peers to understand what that means, especially with, with, with not just with race, but with age discrepancy, with gender. I mean, the way people think and I put this in a perspective because when I looked at the interviews with a white woman and a black man, not just on race, but on gender and also looking, I looked up some stuff about their own personal life, it was interesting how the woman talked about her things were about the fear of being attacked physically, which is a very something a woman would think. And then the black man, he said, I looked at this and thought that could have been me. I'm a big black guy. And there was that tribal identity that's very common in the African-American communities that feeling apart. There's studies that show that being black is very important to the black community versus being white. She said nothing about race, nothing about connection. It was fear. His was about personal connection. And so these things have to be taken into account as our culture's changing as we're becoming more diverse. What does that mean to be judged by a jury of your peers? And how do you make that fair so that the jury is still impartial? And I feel like the current system doesn't take enough into account. Like you even said, maybe there has to be more review of social media. There has to be a more understanding. You have to do that. Because at this point, I feel like, not I feel like, but I can see that in high profile cases, just the idea of peers, meaning some random people from the neighborhood, is not going to work. Yeah. Yeah. That's well said. And this leaves the question. Not about the verdict, but the question of the process is what I'm questioning here. How did that guy end up on the jury? Just because he supposedly appear? Well, okay. Then if you are appear and you feel like you can speak into it, what has your actions been leading up to the case? Are you, can you be, you know, impartial? Can you? That's what the process should be for a jury. It's to put people on the stand that want the best outcome, the right, according to the law, emotionality out of it, history out of it. So if that woman said, and I was the lawyer, and I would determine that she's really was afraid for her life, I would say, not qualified to be on the jury here. Why? Because she is emotionally attached to the case. So I mean, at bare minimum, though, now that the case is over with, with everything that's happened and even the judge remarking that, you know, lawmakers getting involved in this, certainly a setting up grounds for an appeal, would you say that? No, there was an appeal before, before that day we all, you and live here, we say. I should say a successful appeal. They actually made the case for the appeal. Yeah, if the justice system is still passed. You know, the list made the case for the appeal by, by, you know, the politicians weighing in and even the president, United States, that morning said, what the right outcome? No, not the fair outcome, not, hey, we're going to leave it in the, in the hands of the justice department. We're going to trust our system and let's see tomorrow. I'll comment tomorrow. We had that on the show. We talked about it, but no, the morning of even, so they made the case for the appeal. The left did. So yeah, if there's a few, I would be sure there's worst. There's like, I think when I saw, I, I found, I found all the jurors early on and a lot of people I, I didn't have, obviously wouldn't publish this stuff. You have two journalists here. I wouldn't publish this stuff, but one of the jurors, which I was tracking their social media activity, not creep believes are public profiles to try to understand some of the influences that were going on. I remember right after they convened, the juror was like, oh, I hope I made the right decision reminding you, I cannot comment too much how this person looks, but they do not look mentally well and by some of the things that they're into, they're clearly very progressive and very odd and definitely by proxy attached to the BLM movement and their Caucasian too, by the way. So this isn't like the idea of like I said, it's just race doesn't matter. It's why the peers thing is important because people want to make it a racial mindset. I'm saying this is goes much deeper. I'm going, I'm looking, I'm going, oh God, if this literally capital G God, if my life and the trustability of the witness of what I did was in the hands of this, at least I think identifies as a girl. I know I'll be in prison for whatever, if it was some sort of high profile social issue, just being a white man, because this person clearly does does not have a good foundation, looking how they type, they don't know anything. And I can't believe that that's who's in charge of deciding justice. I'm going, my God, that's when peers was written. We actually maybe had some self respect as a people, but now with the degradation of our culture, these amoral people who have no understanding, take gender, race, everything out of it. These amoral people with no understanding of what's right and wrong in their own personal lives are here to decide my moral fate. Yeah, but I would, I would say I would argue it's always been there, maybe not to this level, but that's why the system allows both sides to defense, you know, and the prosecution side of the legal teams to interview the jurors and collectively end up with a, you know, impartial body of people, which in this case, I question whether that process, unless the defense for Chauvin said, listen, I'm not going to rock the boat. This is too controversial. I'm, you know, I don't know, but something wasn't right because under normal circumstances, you wouldn't end with that jury. That would not be the jury. That would be the way, because the system is set up from as old as time to weed out the outliers and in the whack jobs and, you know, the ones with an axe to grind, et cetera, et cetera, because, you know, people use that to get out. I mean, you do jury duty. People will go, well, you know, anybody ever said anything against a obese person because we're prosecuting, I say it all the time, well, you're disqualified. You can't be in the jury. People abuse that too. So I don't know how this jury ended up being this jury. Yeah. All right. You know what? Let's go ahead and take a break. And then we've got Andrew Cuomo coming up next. Yay. It's on a show if it's not a Cuomo show. Andrew Cuomo, who, you know, we've covered on the show all of his scandal about like literally killing, well, not with his hands, but indirectly his policies, killing people in nursing homes. Hey, guns indirectly kill people. It's like the bullets, the one that kills them, not literally with the person's hand. So that's basically what he did. He shot the bullet. Yeah. But the bullets when that killed the other people. There, there you go. That's what it is. That must be why he's getting out of this and still not resigning. Also the fact that he's a Democrat, I know helps, but he had the audacity to say this at a press conference on vaccines yesterday. Watch who the groups were targeting on the vaccination, youthful and the doubtful. And there is an attitude that they'll be fine. Why should they take the vaccine? Maybe you will get a long haul syndrome that would not really sure what it is yet, but a lingering consequence of COVID. Or maybe you go home and kiss your grandmother and wind up killing your grandmother. It's so Andrew formulation of all people telling you if you refuse the vaccine, you could kill your grandmother, which incidentally he already did kill your grandmother. So there's that. There's that. Wow. There's that. I mean, I'm not sure quite even covers it. By the way, I mean, I'm trying to just go. What is going on in that brain? I mean, it's got a cease. I mean, maybe, maybe, maybe he's covering. He's covering for himself going, yeah, you see, other people are going to kill old people, too. It wasn't just him. I mean, I mean, what else do we need to rack up against this guy to get him out of office? Whether it's the abuse of women or killing old people. I'm stunned by that. He is amazing. He's got to make him a Republican. I mean, so that's all you're missing. He's just got the wrong letter on the ticket. I mean, he's got women claiming he's abused. He's killed. He's cheated, light stolen. He's let pedophiles out on the street of his city. He's abolished bail. I mean, what else do you need to do in New York? All of that is fine. But at least we got Donald Trump out of office because he tweeted mean things. He's a mob leader, but I'll be, I'm going to give the benefit of the doubt and just say, I actually don't expect much from New York in terms of like politics. It's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like asking people, can you believe that the mayor of Chicago is corrupt? And you're like, I'm pretty sure you have to be corrupt to play in Chicago politics in Chicago. I know we stop ethics in some counties and some states, but man, we got to, we got to confront the fact like in California and New York and Illinois and these places. I mean, there is not a way for, I believe for a fair, true and honest person to really get ahead and to get into that position. So don't be shocked when you find out those people are exactly who you would assume they would be. Yeah. Speaking of the vaccine, by the way, the FDA is apparently set to authorize the COVID-19 vaccine. I'm going to try my best to deliver this calmly for back for children and teenagers ages 12 to 15 years old next week. So this is of course still for, this is what gets me Elijah, still for emergency use. So it is again, it is not, it has not been approved. Obviously they have not studied it well enough to say, yeah, it's totally safe. We know the long term repercussions. We know all of the possibilities. And you know, it's totally 100% safe. They're approving it for emergency use, I'm sorry, they're authorizing it for emergency use for 12 to 15 year olds. What's the emergency, Yako? Because I know you care a lot about children not being abused and not doing things that are there. This is child abuse. Yeah. What is the, what is the science? This is, there is no science. They can't prove that the vaccines for the adult, there's no proof on anything on these vaccines. Well, they're going to go to any, any authentication or verification or any trial. But can you, but can you just really quickly, and if anyone believes that that's not true, we don't have any long term studies. Is there? I'd like to just point that out. Zero. Like, you can't argue that point. There are no long term studies. Can I be, can I be, give a little caveat to that though? Please. Is that the mRNA technology? mRNA, yes, I know. I know. I've been being developed for at least from my understanding from papers I've read at least a decade. Some, some would even say preliminary findings more, but it's still safe to say that even if it's been a development. But if it's been a development that doesn't mean that the wide range trials have been there, that's, that's even a car. It appears goes through more and longer testing before it's allowed onto the road. Absolutely. Absolutely. And it's like, I, this is where I have a problem with people who say it's someone like me is the problem. Because in fact, I was pushing for vaccinations before this. And I go, the only time that I've ever pushed for vaccinations is some certain vaccinations that are well studied, that have been proven over time. Some vaccinations, like the HPV vaccination, I would tell people I don't, I don't think you should get it. But I'm not your doctor. Figure this out. It's a just be less sexually active, like being more smart with your sex life. But when you go ahead on this and you look at actual vaccinations, I have to say I have autoimmune disorders. I've, I've taken immunology. There's allowed to be debates on this. People wonder like the theory of the epidemic of absence, like our vaccinations and hygiene, what are causing the development of autoimmune disorders. There's actual discussion at a collegiate level of this. 100%. Well rolled. Yep. And they're going, oh yeah, but this vaccine, there's no discussion on it. I'm going, I just came out of graduate level immunology courses where we actually have discussion about the efficacy, the need and the effectiveness of vaccines. But you're telling me, because Bill Gates says that it's fully safe, a computer software engineer, that I'm no longer in the real world allowed to question this, I damn for sure know there's something I should be questioning if they're trying to silence me. Look, those immunology studies on those vaccines you're talking about are vaccines that's been around for a long time, a long time. And people have had them over a period of time when we look at MMR, all these different vaccines and just, I just want Americans to do your homework. Go look at the vaccines in Africa, where there's other real issues and you look at vaccines in America and it pales in comparison. The amount of vaccines today that American child has to go through by their 17th birthday, it's 200% higher than in Africa that has West Nile Ebola, other real issues and go look at Europe. We are a vaccine crazy nation and I'm just telling you, unless you can prove what's going to happen and now you're going to give it to children, the effects will be immeasurable. I'm telling you.
