    "text": " You're a man of action. You live life to the fullest. Embrace your fears. And boldly charge your own path. When life knocks you down, you get back up one more time, every time. You are not easily deterred or defeated. Rugged, resilient, strong. This is your life. This is who you are. This is who you will become. At the end of the day, and after all is said and done, you can call yourself a man. Gentlemen, what is going on today? My name is Ryan Micler, and I am the host and the founder of this podcast. And the movement that is order of man. That's what you're doing here. That's what you're all about. Is about becoming a better man. And that's what we do. We're going to give you the conversation, the tools, the resources, everything that you need to be a more engaged father, a more committed husband, a stronger leader in your community, a better coach, brother, friend, colleague. What else? A better business owner, more effective in every other facet of your life. So today is your ask me anything. Now usually I have this conversation with my co-host, Kip Sorensen. He is not going to be joining us today. I'm doing this one a little bit off the cuff because I'm trying to get ready for Christmas. And I want to make sure we're ahead of schedule so that I can take the week off and so can Kip. So here's where our end our editor is while we want to make sure we give him a break as well. So it's just me today. For better or worse, what we're going to be doing here in just a minute is answering and fielding your questions. These are specifically from the Facebook group and I hope that you enjoy. So before we get into that, let's talk about origin. You guys have heard me talk about them. I did a podcast on, I believe it was Friday of last week. It was 10 things that I've learned in my first year of jujitsu. So go check it out. And the reason I bring that up is because origin is all about the rash guards and the gees that you need in order to up your jujitsu game. But in addition to that, they've got a lot of lifestyle stuff as well. They're boots, they're denim, they've got their supplemental lineup that's partnered up with Jocko. They've got it all. So check it out at origin main.com and use the code order or DER at checkout. Let's not waste much time today, guys. Let's get right into the questions. So again, today I'm going to be fielding questions from our Facebook group. Sometimes we also feel from our exclusive brotherhood, the iron council. We got through most of those questions last week. So I want to make sure that I get to the questions again inside of our Facebook group. Got some good ones here today. And I've also got some not so good ones, but I'll skip those so you won't know what those are. And we'll go for about an hour or so and we'll get to as many questions as possible. If I know the answer, I'll give you the answer. Or at least my opinion. If I don't know the answer, I'll still give you my opinion. And then you can debate with me on whether or not I'm right. All right, guys, let's get into it. Now, usually Kip reads the names and I give him a hard time for butchering these names. Since he's not here, I'm going to be reading the names and I will likely butcher these names. So if I do, I apologize, but it is what it is. So first one, Mike Villeneuve, Villeneuve, Villeneuve, see, I'm going to mess these up right off the bat. He says, knowing what you know now, if you could go back and completely redo your life, would you? The answer to that is very simply no. I would not redo my life. Number one, you can't. So I don't play the game. I don't play the game of like, what if? What if you did this? What if you had this? If you could go back and redo your life or change your life, what would you do? I'm just telling you that's an exercise that is not practical, obviously. It's a lot of times kind of a waste. What I would suggest rather than worrying about what you would redo is ask yourself what I learned that's significantly more valuable than saying, what would I redo? So you have these negative life experiences, whether it's a divorce or you get into some sort of trouble, whatever, whatever it may be, instead of saying, oh man, I just wish I could redo that and dwelling on the past. I want you to be forward thinking. And forward thinking says, okay, here's what happened. Here's where I messed up. Here's what went wrong along the way. What can I learn from this experience and now how can I be better moving into the future? That is a significantly better exercise than what would you redo? What would you start over? Et cetera, et cetera. So focus on forward, focus on moving forward. And moving forward means how can I correct my life? How can I change my life? How can I make different thoughts or actions or behaviors based on what I know? The problem with redoing your life, even if you could, is that it would completely change who you are. And for me, I'm happy. I'm satisfied with where I am. I'm fulfilled. I've got a lot more to do. I understand that and realize that. But I'm not willing to change any element of my life. And if I were to go back and redo something, it'd be like the butterfly effect and just change every other thing about my life. And again, I'm not interested in doing that. So learn, grow, expand. What's happened, it's happened. It's in the past, but you can't learn from it if you had that forward thinking mindset. All right. Number two, Joshua Reynolds, favorite coffee company. I get this question along with alcohol, like favorite beer or favorite, whatever. I don't drink coffee and I don't drink alcohol. So anything that I say you'd have to take with a grain of salt, I will tell you my favorite coffee company, even though I don't drink coffee, is black rifle coffee company. Both Evan and Matt have been on the podcast in the past. I believe in what they're doing. I like their model. I like the guys and who they are. They've become friends over the past several years now. And I would definitely check them out. Again, I don't drink coffee, so I can't tell you what it tastes like. I just know I like those guys and I like the company. Hope it helps to some degree. All right. Joshua Gherkin, he says, what is one Christmas gift that a guy should be asking his significant other for? He says, skip the gym memberships because you should already have that. Thanks in advance. I don't know. I don't know the answer to that. I'm not very good at giving my wife Christmas gift suggestions. She asked me all the time, like, I don't know. Because normally if I just want something, I just go get it. I don't wait for Christmas. So what should you ask for? I don't know. Whatever you want. Hunting stuff. Jiu-Jitsu stuff. That's what I would ask for. Maybe some podcasting gear. Maybe some new technology or a little gadget that I'd like. Some new clothes. I don't know. Whatever you want. Whatever you want for you to decide. All right. Kyle, pride Henderson. I like these easy names. I like when they're easy, when they're tough. I'm in a butcher. I said Kyle, but it is Kyle. So I messed that one up even. Kyle says, what are the benefits in your opinion to bow hunting as opposed to rifle hunting? I know you're only somewhat versed in one, but regardless, thank you. I'm not even really all that well versed in either because I only started hunting in December of 2017. I have killed more animals with my bow than my rifle. In fact, I've only shot, I think, maybe two. Two animals with my rifle. I don't know if you can see I've got a black Hawaiian sheep there and right above it. I've got my deer, the very first deer that I shot. I mean, do whatever works for you. I don't know if there's an advantage necessary or he says the benefits. I don't know if there's a benefit to one over the other. I like bow hunting. I think it's a little bit more difficult. I enjoy getting close and intimate with that animal. I enjoy the spot and stock hunts that I go on. Of course, you can do that with a rifle as well. I don't know. Just pick one. Like whatever you think is going to be best for you or you have an affinity to or maybe you know somebody who's a rifle hunter or a bow hunter. I like the challenge of hunting with a bow. It just seems to be more challenging, more demanding. That's not to take anything away from rifle hunting. I think they're both great and I have no qualms with either one of them. So do whatever works for you. Dave Natto says, what's a better way of disciplining your kids besides an ass whooping? Well, I'm glad you said that there's or at least considering that there's a better way of doing it. I actually don't spank my kids. I don't hit my kids. I don't get physical with my kids that way because I don't think it's advantageous. I don't think it's beneficial. I've heard guys say, well, my dad used to beat my ass and look at me. I don't think one little anecdotal story explains or shares that that's the best way to do it. I mean, consider it if you're where you are and you were disciplined that way as a kid. Consider maybe where you'd be if you weren't disciplined that way as a kid. It's not a very solid argument. What's a better way of disciplining your kids? I think restricting them from activities that they enjoy. I think even before it gets to that point, just explaining. I think a lot of men grew up with the mentality of like, do what I do or excuse me, do what I say. Do it because I'm the dad, et cetera, et cetera. And so we would probably have a natural tendency of doing that to our own children. We'll just do what I say. Look, I mean, there's some times where maybe that's appropriate, but for the most part, I think it's better to explain why a kid is behaving a certain way, why it's not in their best interest, what a better approach would be certainly leading by example. If it gets to the point where there needs to be some discipline, then I would say restriction from certain items or activities that your child really enjoys and likes because there does have to be punishment. I also think this is a big one actually. When it comes to disciplining your kids, make them rectify the situation because nobody wants to do that because it's embarrassing. So for example, if you're, if your kid, I don't know, stole something from, from the grocery store, yeah, you could ground them. Yeah, maybe you could spank them like you're saying here. Again, I would have advised that, but I think it's better to actually go make your kid go back to the grocery store, give them that item back or do some work or pay that individual back and then actually go have the conversation with the individual they had the conversation with about why they stole from the grocery store because I promise you that kid is going to learn so much more because they're going to learn more because there was accountability, there were consequences and they actually had to go fix the situation, not you. Don't rescue your kids all the time. Let them fix their own problems. And if your kid is doing something they shouldn't be doing, then let that child rectify the situation. Like it isn't over just because you discipline them. Let them experience the full weight of the decisions that they've made, the choices that they've engaged in, the thoughts that they have, and if they experience that full weight, I really believe they're less likely to do it in the future. So I hope that helps. Greg Madden, he says, how do you address people who claim that toxic masculinity is the problem with most men? I believe the term is a false narrative used by those who lean to the left politically, socially, etc. Well, let's address this. Let's break this down because I think there's a couple of things at play here. Let's talk about toxic masculinity first as a term, as a phrase. The problem with the phrase, there's a lot of problems with the phrase. One of the problems with the phrase is that nobody knows what you're talking about because I've seen people or heard people who believe that toxic masculinity is using masculine characteristics and virtues in a negative or destructive way. That's one definition. I've also heard people say or even allude to the fact and I think this is the way that academia tends to roll, the way that the medical community seems to be moving, the way that I hear much, much of the chatter on social media and the entertainment business and media talking about is that masculinity in and of itself is inherently toxic. Now, when I say that, people say, no, no, nobody thinks that. Nobody believes that. Well, earlier, I believe it was last year, the American Psychological Association. So this is the organization responsible for the way that the medical community, the psychological community treats and diagnoses their patients, the people that they see. So it's a governing body and it's responsible for the way that, again, much of treatment is administered psychologically. Well, they came out and said that the traits that we would generally consider as masculine and the three traits they used were competitiveness, aggression, and stoicism. So competitiveness, aggression, stoicism, and I look at stoicism as the, not the absence of emotions, but the understanding and appropriate response to the emotions that you have. So they're saying that somehow those traits that I would consider inherently masculine are somehow destructive or dangerous to our young men. So when people say, no, no, nobody thinks that's what they're saying, the American, hear me on this. The American Psychological Association believes that the characteristics that we would generally consider as masculine are somehow inherently destructive and damaging. So when somebody says, nobody thinks that, you're wrong, millions and millions of people believe that masculinity in and of itself is toxic. And that's part of the reason I don't subscribe to the term is because when people say it, I don't know where they're, I don't know what they mean. Do they mean that it's men who aren't displaying a positive way of behaving? Well, maybe that's not toxic masculinity. Maybe that's just being an asshole. Or they mean that just being a man, just by the fact that you were born a man, you're a threat to society. And we know, because what I just told you, that people actually believe that. So I don't, I don't buy the term. Masculinity in and of itself is not toxic. And if it's, if, if that's the problem that people have, I think there's a deeper thing going on here. And I think generally what's happening is these individuals who have a misguided sense of what masculinity is have been hurt by men. They've been hurt by men. And what they've done is because they've been hurt by one man or several men, they've decided that men are bad. Not that man, not that situation that men are inherently bad in what's wrong with the world. So when somebody says toxic masculinity is the problem with most men, that's probably somebody who's hurt. So how do you deal with it? You show them that not all men behave the way in which they are experiencing. Again, that doesn't mean toxic masculinity. It just means that that guy was, was an asshole or, or abusive or he had his own issues that he needed to work out. So you be the kind of man that shows these individuals that this is not how men behave. In fact, men are protectors, providers, providers were virtuous, were honorable, were hardworking, were dedicated. We serve other people. We do all of these wonderful things for society. And in fact, much of society was built on the backs of men. And people say, yeah, that's the patriarchy. Call it what you want. The fact of the matter is that society was built on the backs of men. We work, we slave, we die in battle. We're the ones who generally again going out in the workforce and sacrificing. We take the risk. We die more often earlier and we go to prison more often. There's all sorts of reasons why it's clearly obvious that society was built on the backs of men. I'm not saying that as a victim. I'm just saying that's the truth. We've done a lot and so have women as well. But society is good. I mean, if you look at where we're at in society, everything is amazing. Like we live in the most profitable times. Our health is better than it's ever been. In fact, it was interesting because I saw that I think it was just this year that in America anyways, and I'm not sure if this was globally, but in America, our life expectancy has decreased for like the second or third year in a row. And so you could look at that and say, well, see, that's a problem with the health system. No, it's actually a symptom of the times in which we live. Why? Because people are fat. People are out of shape. They're overweight. They don't work out. They don't eat right. And therefore, because we're obese, a lot of the issues that we run into from a medical perspective and a health perspective are linked to us overeating, us not exercising, us doing the things that we have the luxury, frankly, of being able to do because the times in which we live. So I'm not sure I really answered that question, but I did want to address the point that masculinity is not inherently toxic. There's nothing wrong with masculinity. There's certainly wrong things wrong with some men, not all of them. And you just need to be the example and set the course and then have these types of conversations. By the way, share this podcast. All right, share this podcast. Like, how do you deal with it? You share this podcast. So more people are aware of it and can see what masculinity is really about and what we are to be doing as men. All right, Dominic Bright. How much do you think is a, I don't really understand this question. He says, how much do you think it's an appropriate amount of time a day to be on it? I don't really know what that means. If he's saying like on it as in like in the game. I don't know. I'm not even answer that question because I don't really understand it. All right, Robert Thompson. He says, what exactly is ego and how could one learn to identify their own? This is a good question. Ego is an over inflated sense of worth or self. And that's actually not inherently bad. If you want to be successful, there has to be some sort of ego in your life. You have to be arrogant enough to believe, to have the audacity to believe that you can succeed in spite of having no traffic. Record of success, which is an interesting thing because most people think, well, ego, arrogance, that's bad. And it can be if it's taken to the extreme, that's the difference. If it's taken to the extreme, then you're going to create blind spots in your life. You're not being truthful about who you are and your performance and that creates problems. But I had to be, I had to have somewhat of an ego when I started this podcast to believe that although I never had a successful podcast, that I could start a podcast and be successful at it. Like what in my right mind would, would even illustrate or suggest that I could be successful in this arena? So there has to be some level of ego. And if it isn't, you're probably just going to tuck tail, hide in the corner, not put yourself out into the world, not try to get a promotion. And really, frankly, just not think all that highly of yourself. I think that's a healthy sense of ego and it's certainly okay. In fact, I think it would be advisable. Now, how could one learn to identify their own? I think you look at your results. If your belief system about who you are and how you show up is driving you to take calculated risks, to push outside of your comfort zone, to learn new skills, to develop new talents and abilities and gifts so that you can succeed and you can help other people succeed, then I think that's an element or a factor of a healthy sense of self. Now, if on the other hand, you're not producing the results that you desire, and this requires some sort of after action review, you actually have to evaluate your performance. Most people don't. So what they'll do is they'll go out in their perform of a do their project or whatever it is they're going to do, and then they don't ever give it a second after thought once that project's over. Your project's not over until you've reviewed it and figured out why you were successful or why you weren't successful. So then you can go out and either replicate the success or test new variables to produce a new more effective outcome for yourself. So doing your after action review. Now, in your after action review, if you realize and see and identify that you didn't have the right information or you didn't have the right people or the right tools, well, that's, that's might be an indicator that you were going to be able to do that. This is an indicator that you were closed off to those things or closed off to the idea that maybe there's something you don't know. So do your after action reviews. Look at what's contributing to your successes and what's contributing to your failures and ask yourself, is it your ego? Is it your thought process? Is it limiting beliefs? What is it that's keeping you from what you want? you want. This requires a lot of internal and self-reflection, which is something I highly suggest you do. And you build into your systems, which we've done in our battle planning system. A lot of you guys are familiar with that. All right. Elijah Palmer, he says advice, you would go back in time again. We're going back in time now and give yourself as a soon to be father. Here's the advice I give to soon to be fathers. By the way, if this is you, Elijah, congratulations on either your child or your child who's arriving soon. Here's my, here's my suggestion. Because you've heard it all. You've heard all the other stuff. Your job as a father is to render yourself obsolete. That's it. Your job as a father is to render yourself obsolete, meaning you've got to put yourself out of work. So that's going to require love. It's going to require patience. But it's also going to require sacrifice and discipline and doing hard things, things that aren't comfortable and having conversations that are awkward, like the birds and the bees and some of these other conversations that you just, I mean, nobody really like is looking forward to having, but you need to be able to have those conversations. Because if your job is to render yourself obsolete and you're not willing to have those conversations, then your child grows up thinking something inaccurate or not even a full view of the way in which life operates. So if I were to go back in time and give myself advice, or I think more accurately just say, what advice would I give to you? It would be that remember and all things that your job is to render yourself obsolete. And I feel like if you use that as a litmus test for what you're doing, you're going to be significantly more successful as a father. All right. Here's Bubba Downs. Now, he's talking to Kip, but I'm going to fill in for Kip here. He says, Kip, do the voice. How loud are you going to yell tap after I catch you in a kumura and thus proving the dominance of curve brim superiority? Well, the answer, Bubba, very simply is that's not going to happen. And I would pay money to see you and Kip roll and you attempt to get Kip in a kumura. That would be very fun to watch. And I'm sure this will happen at some point that you guys will roll. And I just want to make sure that you ensure that I'm there when that happens so I can see how this all goes down. All right, Mitchell Moshuri says, how to teach boys to become men in different age groups from two to 15, I'd say that would be a good podcast. All right, well, I'm not going to do a podcast on it because we're doing the ask me anything right now. In fact, if you go back, there's a podcast, you type this and do a search for it. The podcast is, if you just type raising kings, I believe I talk about it there. I think that's what it's called raising kings. I also do one for daughters called raising queens. So just do a search where every listen in a podcast, type in order of man raising kings and kings and order of man raising queens. And then also do a search for order of man writes a passage because I talk about each one of those things. And one of the things that we do or in the process of doing, I should say with our children, our boys specifically, because they're at that age, is every two years starting at age eight, we do a rite of passage. So it's not just one thing. It's a system of passages. So it's eight, 10, 12, 14, 16, the last one's excuse me, 18, when they're when they leave and they're out on their own. So check those resources out. Tyler stick tips for dealing with separation or divorce. Tyler, I talked about this last week. So go back and listen to last week's ask me anything. I know that this is a very difficult time. I know that this is a challenging situation. I've been there, not the divorce section or segment of that, but the separation segment. And I'm telling you that was the darkest time of my life. I think anybody who's gone through a separation or divorce can probably attest to that, that it's a very dark and uncomfortable time. What I would say, and this is what I said on the last podcast, go back and listen, because it's pretty good, is you need to make yourself the project. Because right now it's likely that you're focusing all of your time and your energy and your attention and your resources and everything else on her. And that's natural. Like you want to win her back, you want to fix the marriage. It's likely that's what's happening. So it's natural to feel that way. It's counter productive, though. It's not going to work. In fact, the more that you focus on her, the greater wedge, you're going to drive between you and her. So rather than focusing all your time and attention energy on her, re-channel that, redirect it to yourself. Focus on yourself. Exercise, find good friends, develop a new hobby, read a lot of good books, secure promotions, start a business. These are all the things that you should be doing right now, making yourself the project. We as men are builders. And a lot of the times we focus all of that energy externally and we build these external things. I'm suggesting that you focus it internally, at least for now, to some degree, and begin to build up who you are as a man. So that if this relationship works out, or another one down the road, that you will be in the best possible position as an individual and sovereign man to be the type of husband, father, leader, head of your household that you have a desire to become. So go back and listen to that last podcast. But generally, that's what I would suggest. And all will work out the way that it's meant to Rob Butler. He asks, our sports, such as the NFL, MLB, et cetera, just a distraction from what we should actually be doing. The answer is they can be. It can be. So simple as that, because you could actually say that about anything, right? You could say, is podcasting a distraction from what you should be doing? Is going to the gym a distraction from what you should actually be doing? The litmus test on that is whether or not it's serving you and moving you in the right direction. So if you're going to go to an NFL game with the buddies and hang out and have a great day, is that helping you? Yeah. Yeah, I think it is because you're building camaraderie with friends. You're having a good time. You've got some entertainment and all as well. That's a good thing. Now, if you spend all weekend Saturdays for college, Sundays for NFL, and you spend all weekend watching every possible game, and you've got 200 channels so you can catch the highlights and you're switching between games back and forth, and you're ignoring your wife, you're ignoring your kids, you're not doing what you should be doing with regards to projects or work, things like that, then of course, that's a distraction. So I can't determine that for you. I can't tell you, yes, if you watch any football to distraction, I'm not going to say that. I mean, there's things that I do that, you know, I just like some entertainment, right? I just want to be entertained. I want to have a good time. I mean, that's watching a movie or watching TV or doing a puzzle, which is something I like to do with my wife. Like, there's nothing wrong with being entertained. There's nothing wrong with going to watch a movie or watching a football game with your favorite team. Like, I don't see anything wrong with that. We're playing video games even. Like, I don't see anything wrong with playing a video game with your kids and having a good time together. It's when you take it to the extreme that it becomes a problem. And you guys all know what that line is, or at least you should know. All right, Sean, Kaz, you mentioned in your last podcast that you tasked yourself with asking for a discount wherever you would make a purchase. What realization made you identify that you could improve in this area? Can you share any other specific tactics you have used to get out of your comfort zone? It wasn't a matter of improving in the area of asking for discounts or securing discounts. It was, it was an objective or a task or a challenge to make myself step outside of my comfort zone. That's what it was. So the challenge was wherever I went, I think I did this for a week, wherever I went, I had to ask for a discount. And it was hard for me because I really have an issue with appearing cheap. I don't want to appear cheap to other people. So I'll pay full price. So it was very difficult for me to go in to wherever, whether it was a restaurant or a retail clothing store, wherever I was, I asked for a discount. That was a hard thing. And it helped me. It helped me realize that people really don't think much of it. It helped me realize that you get more often than not what you ask for. Because I was amazed. I got some discounts. I'm like, no way am I going to get a discount on that. And I did because I was, I just was willing to ask. That's the only thing I did. And I would get discounts at places, which really helped me be more assertive. So if you're thinking about how can you step outside of your comfort zone, and specifically with regards to what we're talking about here, Sean, is the assertiveness workbook is a very powerful resource to help you identify your comfort zone with being assertive with other human beings, and then gives you some actionable strategies for for doing it, for for being more assertive. All right. Joe Cressel says, how is your faith influenced your definition of yourself when you were in your twenties versus your thirties? I don't know. I don't. There's no difference to me between your twenties and your thirties. I mean, yeah, you're going to be older. You're going to be more mature. But it doesn't, it doesn't matter whether it's your twenties or thirties faith. My faith is going to influence me the same. I mean, it's, it's, it's something that grounds me. It's something that gives me the ability to focus on the long term versus the short term, that there are eternal consequences and aspects of our lives. And it's a good thing. So I didn't, I never really understood the twenties versus thirties. I guess my question for you would be, why are you asking? You know, what, like, are you about to turn 30 years old and you're wondering like what you should be doing? Well, I mean, you can, you can determine that for yourself. But I think faith is a very, very powerful component. It's a powerful component of my life. And I believe it'd be more powerful if more men had had faith in, in a higher power. And you know, it's, it's kind of, it's, it's actually really interesting, because a lot of guys say, well, religion's just designed to get you to like toe the line and do what you're supposed to do. Yeah, that's like, that's everything. That's the point of even a code of conduct, even if you wrote the code of conduct, it's to get you to behave in a certain way, to live to a moral code. I don't see anything wrong with believing in God. I don't see anything wrong with having faith. I don't believe in or see anything wrong and believing with, in adhering to some code. We all have it. It's all varying, but we all have a code. So when guys talk about religion, organized religion is bad because of this. No, I, I choose to, I'm spiritual. I choose to be involved with organized religion because it helps me be a better man, because I have a framework. And I have a foundation for the way I operate in my life. And it's the same 20s and 30s. It's the same 20s. I was probably not as open to it as I am in my 30s, because I thought I knew more in my 20s and I was more arrogant. But life has a way of kicking your ass over a decade and showing you that you don't have it all figured out and you don't know as much as you think you do. Corey Brinton, have you taken the knife out of the wall in your barn yet? So a little backstory here, a lot of you guys know we moved to Maine about six months ago, seven months ago. And we've got this big beautiful barn. And as I was cleaning it out and getting it all organized, I walked up a set of stairs to the second level of the barn. And on, on the wall, right at the top of the stairs, when you walk up there, there's like a kitchen knife stuck in the wall. And the answer is no, I haven't left it there. Somebody wanted it there for a reason. Excuse me, I haven't taken it off. Somebody wanted it there for a reason. So I just left it there. And now when we do our events and things like that, and people are using that area, we'll take it out. But yes, there's a knife stuck in the wall of our barn. And it is still there in the same place. No, it's kind of weird. All right, Luke, uh, realt, as it relates to the adage, everything in moderation, is there an unhealthy level of dedicating yourself to fitness? I'm looking for something deeper than the obvious. Why the obvious is good enough. The obvious is that, of course, you can take fitness to the extreme. You're jeopardizing your relationships, jeopardizing your other objectives, jeopardizing work because you're so consumed with being fit and looking good and getting strong. I mean, you could even, uh, you hurt yourself. And that's maybe deeper than the obvious is like, if you, if you commit yourself and dedicate yourself to fitness, and that's all you're doing, you're, you're probably going to over train and you might hurt yourself, at least in the long run. So you don't need anything deeper than the obvious. There's, yes, there's dangers in overtraining. There's dangers in dedicating everything that you have to fitness. It's, it's important that we be, uh, well-rounded individuals. And if it's all about fitness, then you're probably leaving some of that stuff off the table. All right, Todd Anderson, finally, after eight years of denial, I stepped out and began a PTSD evaluation. Why are men so reluctant to come forward with mental health concerns? Because they don't want to appear weak. That's it. The reason that men are reluctant to come forward with mental health concerns is because we don't want to appear weak. There's nothing else to it, but there's nothing wrong with fixing yourself either. And there's nothing wrong with getting the help that you need. In fact, that's going to actually make you stronger when you address those things, when you stop living in delusion and you stop pretending that you have everything figured out and you're willing to admit that maybe there's a problem to the appropriate sources. You don't need to come out to everybody and tell them that you have PTSD, but a licensed professional who can help you with these things. Yes, you can do that. There's this really weird trend in society of vulnerability. I just need vulnerable, vulnerable, vulnerable. No, you need to be, and I don't even consider this a vulnerability, but you need to share what needs to be shared in order to get the help that you need from the qualified sources. So if you're just putting things out on the internet about, wow, whatever your problems are, I don't know that that's healthy and many people do it just for the sake of being vulnerable. That's stupid. It's a waste of time. It's inefficient. It's ineffective. And it might actually come back to hurt you because you expose yourself to the wrong people. Don't do that. Figure out what's going on. Be willing to get the help that you need from the qualified people that can actually give you the help that you need and have a purpose for dare I say being vulnerable, which I don't like that term. Okay. So I commend you for doing that after eight years. But yes, we don't want to appear weak in anything that would maybe allude to our weakness is something that's hard for us to do. Sean Nanya says, what can we do as a group of men trying to better ourselves or families or countries to fix this political divisiveness? Look, you can only do what you can do. The political divisiveness, it takes two parties to bicker and bitch and moan about this stuff. So if somebody wants to bicker and be divisive, then I would just say disengage because there's nothing that you're going to do or say that's going to improve the situation. A lot of people just like to be divisive. They like to be polarizing. They like the drama. And I don't like the drama. So if somebody's going to get political with me, oh, I should say overly political with me or wants to fight about things that I'm not interested in fighting about, I'm just not going to engage. Like you can't like nothing can chase you if you don't run, right? It's when you run that the thing chases you. It's the same thing in this context. Nobody can argue with you if you don't be argumentative. So if somebody begins to argue with you, then it's not grounded or it's not respectful or intelligent, then just don't argue back. And that's how you fix the divisiveness. And then you also be an example in your family, in your community, your country, like you're talking about here. You know, I can't tell you how many people that I've talked with who had judgments about who I was because the way I talked or the things I believed or the way that I looked. And then when you talk with these individuals and you have a sincere, intelligent discussion with them, things change. And I've got friends who are gay, I've got friends who are liberal and even more left leaning. Like I have those types of friends because we don't necessarily have to talk about this and we know each other. We know that we're good people regardless of what it is we decide to do in our lives and how we live it and what we think about the world. And ultimately, I think most people want the same thing. We want to be fulfilled. We want some love in our life. We want some money in the bank account. We want some experiences. We want to chase meaningful hobbies and activities and regardless of what political side of the aisle that you sit on, like that's what everybody wants. So let's have some more serious discussions. Andy See Lake again says, when am I bringing back the original order of man stickers? So the original order man sticker is the circle and it's got the axis and the O and the M. The newer one has on the outer ring protect provide preside. I think I've told you this, Andy, on the original order of man stickers. If you take like you take the stick the decal and you only stick on there the circle and the axis and don't stick on the protect provide preside and outer circle, it is the original sticker. So you can buy the new one and turn it into the original one. All right. This is a long one. Chuck Smalley. How are we doing on time, by the way? Overgo. We've got about 40 minutes into this thing. Chuck Smalley. How in the world can I approach this if I want to advance a relationship dating a woman who's raising a son 12 years old, he hits her yells at her interrupts her when she's talking makes all the rules for her to follow makes I'll keep reading, but I've already got some thoughts on this makes the rules for to follow, makes her clean up everything after him dinner plates closed literally everything and gives him and she gives him everything never yells at him still allows him to sleep in bed with her and so on. I think you get the picture. Even the boys therapist has told mom she's harming him and doing them wrong. She refused to accept it and allows him to rule the roost. I try to stay clear, but when I'm around, I refuse to accept these actions and behaviors obviously causing some stress. I've already raised two successful children on my own. So it's not like I'm new to this. Don't do it. Chuck, brother, don't do it. The kid obviously has some problems. Mom's obvious got some problems too. And you are going to find yourself in a world of hurt. I'm just telling you right now, you're going to find yourself in a world of hurt. She's she's not she doesn't have a healthy view of relationships, which not it was probably not only her son, but it could potentially be you as well. I realize that you say you want to advance in this relationship. Look, there's deal breakers. There's deal breakers. And for what it's worth, in my opinion, if this were me, this is a deal breaker. She's she does not have a healthy approach to relationships. You're going to get sucked into this. You're going to try to discipline him. She's going to get mad at you for disciplining him. He's going to hate you. She's going to hate you. And then it's going to end two, five, 10 years from now when you could have just ended it to begin with. This is not a healthy thing. And she's not approaching it healthily. And I don't know the entire situation. Sounds like she's seeing a therapist or at least having the kids see a therapist, but she's not taking the advice it sounds like. So if this is what you're telling me, my advice is you ought to consider cutting ties. All right, John Wayne Mullins, have you assessed and addressed yourself image? He's got a he's got an image here of the law of the mirror, which I am not familiar with. So I'm not going to answer that because I don't want to speak from ignorance. But so I don't know if he's talking about a specific exercise. How have I assessed or addressed myself image? It's just something I'm aware of. How do I come across? How do people see me? There's books that I've read on it. What Sally Hogg's head has a book. I can't remember what it's called right off hand, but she talks about how you're perceived by other people. And there's personality tests that you can take. And so I've done all that for what it's worth. I don't know if there's something specific that you're asking about my own self image or a certain process that maybe you use, but that's what I've done. Brandon Burroughs, as a husband, it is my responsibility to make excuse me, let me start over, as a husband, is it my responsibility to make sure my wife is happy all the time? Or is it my wife's responsibility to yourself? What is happy? What does that mean? Like what would make her happy? Right? So, depending on that question or that answer that question, I think would give you a better answer. But generally, no, it's not your responsibility to make her happy. Like you can't make somebody feel anything. You can't make her be happy. You can't make her be sad. You can't make her be angry. You can't make her experience in emotion. You can do things that might potentially lead to her being happy or lead to her being frustrated. But if you're just trying to make her happy, what does that even mean? Would she be happy if you bought her a diamond necklace? Probably. So, should you buy a diamond necklace? I don't know. Depends on your situation. Or how many diamond necklaces are you going to buy her? Are you going to buy her something every time she feels bad? I don't know her situation, but I think we inherently know that it's not your job to make people happy. It's your job to create an environment in which she can thrive. And that might lead to fulfillment, joy, satisfaction, and happiness. But she's got a part to play in it. And so do you. Your job is to create the environment, to be influential, to lead yourself, and to lead your family, including her. Now, if she's going to be happier or not, that's on her. And you can't determine that. Ben, Gallup. Let me switch away here. There we go. Where do you see yourself in 10 years and order of man in 10 years, 20 years, like many popular podcasts, you've obtained an amount of celebrity that's likely to affect your future. I've been listening to such podcasts lately and wondering to myself where the podcasters will ultimately go from here. Will some just disappear? Do they have a plan? That's why I'm asking. Yeah, a lot of them will disappear. A lot of these podcasters will just disappear just like anything else. And a lot of them will evolve. And that's my plan to evolve. What is that going to look like in 10 years? I don't know. I don't know if you would have asked me six years ago if I'd be podcasting and living in Maine and reaching millions of men through the words that we share. I would say you're insane. There's no way because it wasn't available. So I don't know what technology is out there, but I will say I'm open to new ideas. I'm open to new insights. I'm open to evolving and new ideas and technologies that are going to be available. And will it be order of man? I mean, I think, but it could be something completely different. So I don't plan out my 10 or 20 years. I just know I want to continue to evolve. Simon Sennick has some great information in start with why. So if you look at his circle, you can just Google this if you're not familiar with it. It's like a circle, like it looks like a target. And inside it says start with why. And then I believe it says how is next. So you have why, how, and then what? So your what can change, right? If I want to impact men and I want to help men become better fathers, husbands, business owners, community leaders, etc. Well, that might be my my why. Why is that important to me? Because I grew up without a father figure in my life. And I feel like if I would have had that, I would have had a better better advantage. I look around and I see other boys growing up with dads. I see men who are broken, they're miserable, they're depressed, they're suicidal, they're sedated. And I've been there. I don't want men to experience that. That's my why. How right now is how I'm going to solve it is by giving you the conversations, the tools, the resources, the discussions, introductions to other other successful men so you can learn from. And then the what is order of man? We do all of that through the order of man funnel. My why will probably always be that or contain an element of that. How I do it and what exactly we're doing to achieve the why might vary depending on the situation, technology, resources, etc. Chris Coker says, how do I talk to my 13 year old son about becoming a man? What do I talk about? I'm thinking about during a backpacking fishing trip or something along those lines. Chris, I got to commend you that you're thinking about this is very, very powerful. I wish you would have started a little bit earlier because 13 is but look, you're starting now. So that's great. One's one's the best time to start earlier. One's the next best time right now. So I commend you. And maybe you have. I won't say that you haven't. Maybe you've already been talking about these things. You know, 13 years old, I definitely think you're going to be talking about attraction to girls. He's probably already attracted to girls and you've had some of these conversations. If you haven't had the birds and the bees or some element of it, like you need to start having those conversations. Definitely pornography, drug use and abuse, being influenced by your peers, start thinking about the future and what your son might want to do. I mean, this look five years away, he's gone. And that comes very, very quickly. So really think about what he might be experiencing now and how a man handles those things. Talk about what it means to be a man. As I have these conversations with my son, I talk about a man's role and job is to be a protector, a provider, a presider. And then we break each one of those down and we talk about what that looks like and what we can do and what activities that we can engage in and all the conversations that we have are framed around how to be a better man. And you're going to know based on his maturity level where he's at and what kind of conversations you should have. But ultimately, I would think about what he's experiencing right now as a 13 year old, drugs, pornography, girls, potential career, school, peer pressure, fighting, these are all really good conversations to have because that's what he's thinking about at 13 years old. John Moffatt, he says, how to decide between two career paths you're equally passionate about, but both require all of your energy, focus and attention. I think it'd be easy to say just pick one and maybe that's what you need to do. But one exercise that I really like when I'm faced with two decisions or more that are challenging and I can see myself going either way is we have this beautiful ability to project ourselves out into the future. And that's what I would do, John, project yourself out into the future 20, 30 years from now in looking back at your life currently, your decision that you need to make today, what decision will you be happy that you made? Now, some guys when I say that, they're like, well, I don't know. Of course, you don't know, because we're not there yet. I'm asking you to use your conscious ability to predict what may happen, to think about life, what life would look like, to envision how this would ultimately look. Yes, you don't have all the variables at your at your disposal. You don't know all that stuff, but you can consciously make a decision based on what the future you would look like. So again, go out 20 to 30 years from now, look back on your life today and ask yourself what decision will you be happy that you've made? And when you come to the conclusion, take that path. By the way, you can always change paths. So if you choose this one path and you realize very quickly or even five years from now that that wasn't the path for you, you can pivot. And that's okay. It's acceptable. In fact, if you find out that that's what you should be doing, then it's encouraged. Sean Wilton, I have a bad habit of saying I will do things to pleat. Let's see. Let me start over again. I have had a bad habit of saying, we'll do things to please others. Okay, have my battle plan in place, but still unsure that when I'm taking Sean, you got to clean up this grammar here because I'm having a hard time reading this. Guys, by the way, like I see these questions, like use punctuation, use grammar. I know that we live in the social media world where it's like, I don't know, it's like shorthand, but I can't read this. Having my battle plan in place, but still unsure that when I'm taking on an activity, if I'm doing it for me or secretly to please others. Okay, how do you know the difference? Thanks, Sean, for New Zealand. All right, thanks for the question. Guys, we've got to clean up the grammar stuff. Like that, I think that I actually think that's really important. I wish more guys would do that. And it's pretty amazing when I see some of these questions. All right, Sean, here's how you know the difference, whether or not you're doing it to please others. What is your motive? Ask yourself, what is your motive? Is this something that you want to do? Do you think this is right? Do you think this is the right course of action? Or do you think this is a please others? By the way, it can be the right course of action and also please others. And it can be the right course of action and not please others. So there might be a correlation there. And just because it happens to be pleasing to other people doesn't mean you're wrong. So ask yourself, what is in your best interest? What is in the best interest of the project that you're working on, the path that you're pursuing, and then start working towards those things? Place the mission first. If the mission comes first, then the way that you communicate with others is going to vary based on what the objective is. In my relationship, for example, my marriage, the mission is to create a happy, thriving, fulfilled relationship. If I do everything for her about her, please her in every way, is that long term going to create a healthy relationship? The answer is most certainly no. It might feel like it because she's going to be happy to that previous question we had about making your wife happy. It might feel like it, but long term, if you do everything for your wife is not sustainable and it's going to create an unhealthy dynamic. So ask yourself, what is the objective? And how do I need to treat people? What activities do I need to gauge in? What practices do I need to employ in order to ensure that the objective and the mission is met? All right, I think we're getting close on time here. I think I'm going to take two or three more. Sean, some, Samar Tano says, what kind of beard is best? There is no best kind of beard. So whatever you like. Jason King, will you guys ever put out a work, workout routine? The hardest part for me about working out is choosing what to do and when also side note a meal plan? No, I will likely never put out a work route workout routine. There's plenty of stuff, plenty of stuff. I mean, post that in the Facebook group, you find all kinds of answers, but no, we likely won't do a workout routine. Darren Bertram, what are your all thoughts on adult ADHD and problems with executive dysfunction? I mean, I know it exists. I don't know enough about it. I'm not a medical professional, but yeah, I think if you have some levels of ADHD, if it's extreme levels, then you probably ought to get medical attention and help and see if you can regulate some of that. If it's just that you're hyper and energetic and have some excitement, then do something to figure that out. I mean, I tend to lean more towards that. I'm passionate. I'm excited. I talk fast. Obviously, it's what I'm doing here. I lose focus very quickly and I start to focus on other things, so I just play to it. I find that things that are engaging and uplifting and good for me, and that seems to work. Mark Reeves will take a couple more. This is something Mark likes to do. He likes to ask questions that I would not nearly even remotely have the answer to. Just Google your question. Rick Diamond, what are your suggestions for those of us trying to create our own men's groups? How shall we grow it? Let's do what I did. That's very simple. Just just do what I did. Have it revolve around a mission or a purpose or an objective, invite other people, be engaged, get the guys asking questions, have them invite their friends, share things that are valuable to them, ask what's important, create solutions. Just do what I did. John Stambaugh, I should say, hey, Ryan, been looking into growing my tribe and along with along with that looking for mentors. I'm a well established in my industry, but I want to grow further both personally and professionally as a seasoned business owner. Where should I look for this type of resource? And I should I expect to offer payment? Yeah, you should. You should definitely look into your current sphere. You should look into people who are doing exactly what you want to do. And you should expect to offer payment. If you want somebody to mentor you or coach you, yeah, that's what you should do. I get emails every single day from guys, will you mentor me? Will you coach me? Guys, like, that's what the podcast is. That's what the Facebook group is. I wrote a book. I've got the videos. I mean, there's so much information out there. I'm not going to just mentor a mentor in you. It's all there. So use that. If you want individual coaching, then, you know, it's got to be it's got to be fair, which means that I might coach you if there's compensation for that, if there's exchange of value, your compensation for the value I offer you. So look for people who are doing exactly what you want to do or have produced results for people doing what you want to do and reach out to them. Hey, I see that you've done this. I see that you haven't success. I'd like to I'd like to get some coaching from you. Do you offer any sort of coaching or mentoring and what would that look like? Just ask. When I started in the when I started my podcast, it was a podcast geared towards medical professionals and their financial services. That's my background. And I reached out to a gentleman by the name of Jeff Rose because Jeff was doing what I wanted to do. He had a very successful financial planning practice. Then he had a blog and a podcast and YouTube channel. He was doing very, very well. So I reached out to him. I said, Jeff, appreciate what you're doing. I love what you're doing. You're actually on the path that I want to be walking. Would you be available for some coaching? He says, yes, I would. Here's what I charge. Are you interested? I said, yes, I am. I paid him via I don't know PayPal or something. And we sat down for an hour over Skype, I believe. And he walked me through some processes and we did that two or three times. And that was the extent of it. And then I moved on and he's doing his thing and I'm doing mine. But that was very, very valuable for me. And it was my first, I would say my first real formal introduction to to paying for coaching. And it was very, very valuable. All right, let's take one or two more. I've said that for the last 10 questions now. Art Montoya, besides burn and learn, are there any methods to opening up young man's eyes to his dead end partner? I mean, just talk with that. Like if he has a, I'm assuming he has a significant other who is a bum, essentially. I would just say just talk with him, be a friend. You know, unsolicited advice is rarely accepted and enjoyed, quite frankly. So yeah, I would say that you probably ought to just be a friend. You know, maybe you don't even have that conversation, but you just be there for him. You talk with him. If he's, if he's open to it, great. Talk more about it. If he closes up, move change, change directions. Just be a friend. Last one here. A.J. Jones, how do you often, how often do you try to disconnect from technology since you run a digital company? I'm thinking of starting a digital venture, but wanted to avoid being consumed by social media and whatnot. Well, I try to disconnect in the evenings. And I also try to disconnect in the weekends. A lot of people will reach out on the weekends and then they'll get upset that I don't answer them back within 24 hours. It's like, it's Sunday. I'm not going to, I'm not going to do a bunch of emails and everything else on Sunday. So you just wait for tomorrow. Outside of that, create solid boundaries. Like I tried to turn my phone off. I try not to check my computer. I try to hustle and do as much as I possibly can during the workday so that I'm not consumed with thinking about what needs to get done outside of my working hours, whatever those are for you. And just be very, very aware of it. Be keenly aware of what's going on, what's consuming you. Talk with your wife. She'll tell you if you're being consumed by digital media and technology and your phone and everything else. Create those boundaries, have the boundaries in place, and then adhere to them. And you'll make it work. All right, guys, I think we went for about an hour. I think we got through, I don't know, probably 20, 20 plus questions. So I really appreciate the questions.
