    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show podcast. Welcome in Clay Travis, Buck Sexton show Monday edition of the program. Congratulations to the Eagles and to the Chiefs advancing to the Super Bowl. Novak, Joe Kavich will probably talk about that at some point wins the Australian Open and a victory for everyone who has refused to get the COVID shot because it is worthless. But good news to start on Monday. There were significantly no riots of consequence in the wake of the Tyree Nichols video release around 6 p.m. Central on Friday afternoon, evening across the country. I know there were some small scattered flare-ups, but by and large, everything remained for the most part peaceful. And that is a very good thing because the fear was that once more the summer of 2020 rioting would unspool across the nation. Now, Buck, what I would argue here is that's because ultimately Black Lives Matter only gets angry when Black Lives are impacted and white people are involved in those lives being taken. And therefore, it's really not Black Lives Matter. It's Black Lives Matter and the parenthetical when white people are involved in Black death because when the video came out, this video to me was far worse. And the videos, I should say of these five police officers in Memphis, what they did to Tyree Nichols was far worse to me than what happened to George Floyd on video. And if you consider that while you might be upset about George Floyd's interaction with the police and the way it went and believe it was criminal as it has been proven to be, there was a reason police were called because George Floyd was trying to pass a counterfeit bill and he was also on drugs. So police were specifically requested in this situation with Tyree Nichols. There does not seem to have been Buck any reason for the initial police stop to have taken place. And all of the violence that ensued since to me is far worse than what we saw happen to George Floyd. Yet, and I would submit this is the reason because it was five Black police officers. There was virtually no riot. The media has tried to argue and will play CNN, MSNBC, the like, have tried to argue, Oh, this is still an example of white supremacy. But most people just simply don't believe it. And so it's a positive sign that there was no rioting pillaging looting, so to speak, Buck. But also this just further epitomizes because the video was as bad or worse than I anticipated it was going to be that really they can only mobilize when there are white people that are involved in misbehavior or potential criminal allegations. I think we should have the discussion about police and policing now that that they always say, now is the time for reform or now is the time to do something about law enforcement. Let's look at the reality of law enforcement in Memphis right now. Let's let's understand what's actually going on. As we said last Friday before the video was out before we had seen it because the show ended prior to the release, they wanted to get rid of this a scorpion unit. That was the initial call. So they're focusing in on an anti violent crime unit in the Memphis PD. What's the reality of the Memphis Police Department in recent years? It can have it has a very hard time getting people to sign up to want to be cops in Memphis. Yeah, so hard that in fact, the Memphis Police Department in a less brutality, more diversity initiative, by the way, decided that they were going to change standards dramatically for who could be a police officer in Memphis. They even were willing to give felony waivers. That has been confirmed. New York Post have this up. Felony waivers for cops. Oh, you're convicted of a felony? Well, we really need cops in Memphis right now because nobody wants to sign up for this. I mean, they were giving, they were giving $15,000 bonus upfront. They waived that you had to have even an associate's degree. If you just had a few years of work experience, they're desperate for cops. Why are they desperate for cops in a city like Memphis? Well, let's take a moment, shall we? If you're a law enforcement officer in the last few years in this country, in a high crime area where a lot of the crime is disproportionately, you know, committed by minorities, if you're in that community, do you feel like you're going to be backed up when things get rough as a law enforcement officer? No, you don't. So very few people will go up to sign up. The kind of people that you want to sign up aren't doing it. And so what you have is a lowering of standards and then a tragic incident like this occurs. And they say, you know, we should do let's ban more police units. Let's blame the cops even more instead of looking at these cops did something bad. What's going on structurally within the police department overall? I mean, to talk about a difference in training, okay, here's one thing. I'm very noticeable clay. A lot of people pointed this out. I think they said there were 71 commands given over the course of the video. I wrote in 2017 about an incident in Mesa, Arizona with a man named Daniel Shaver Daniel. This is all on video. And I remember I was very upset by this case because a white cop with a rifle, in my opinion, executed a guy in obviously is up for people who have not seen it. It's very difficult to watch. I mean, this guy is in the white, the victim here was white. The cop was was charged with murder, a jury inexplicably, in my mind, yeah, the cop off. But because they the whole thing hinged on whether or not Daniel Shaver was complying. Well, he first of all, he did absolutely nothing wrong. He had a BB gun in his hotel room, which he was legally allowed to have. Someone called the cops. They ran into the cops came into the hallway. The guy who shot him had etched into his AR 15, you know, like, you know, you're dead or you're going to die. I mean, the guys, not somebody want to be a police officer, obviously. And he starts barking commands like, you know, put your put your hands behind your head, put your feet together, crawl toward me, keep your head. I mean, if you didn't have a gun pointed at you, yeah, you wouldn't be able to follow. You wouldn't be able to follow. You would be able to follow. You'd be like, what are you talking about? The guys, yeah. But then it's, oh, he's not obeying commands. And he just, he just just shoots the guy. I mean, yeah, it's an execution. It's on video. But he's white and the victims, why it's a clay, was there national outrage about it? I wrote about it at the hill.com at the time. The story went viral, but was there a big conversation about it? See, you didn't know, no, because there wasn't a racial angle. Well, guess what? Looking at commands that police officers give and the training therein might actually be a really useful thing. Might have actually prevented some tragic incidents later on, but didn't get the attention it needed. So if you want to talk about training right now, yeah, what are the protocols? I mean, when they're telling Tyree Nichols, for example, comply, and he is, it looks like a company to comply. Yes. Trying to comply. Cops need to know the second that someone is complying and you're shouting comply and hitting him. You are engaging in police brutality. But, you know, the, the, I have never even heard the comply discussion at the national level about meaning how cops should be trained to escalate through that process and not say you're not doing that at once or now I'm going to beat you or even shoot you. But instead, it's always get rid of the unit. It's racism. The usual thing. I would love to hear from cops out there who listen to us. And we have a ton of those listeners who have watched this video and what they thought about what they saw 800 282 282 Buck over half of the Memphis police force is black. All five of these officers that were charged with murder are black yet there has been a desperate attempt to try to tie this to white supremacy, which just hasn't worked. And, I mean, it's gone across the board. I mean, we've got audio here from a couple of these different guys that I thought would make sense. But the thing that I would say for all of you out there to think about is we've lost on the left wing. They have lost the ability to analyze individual decisions and hold individuals responsible for the choices that they make white, black, Asian, Hispanic, whoever you are. Ultimately, we are all responsible for our own individual decisions. And Eric Adams says, who's a former police captain says racism was involved in the beating of Tyree Nichols to death. Let's play cut for chief CJ Davis. And in my interview with her, she said that all the officers being black, it takes race off the table. Do you agree with that? No, I don't. I think that I understand what the chief was saying. And I think she really handled this situation in a very professional way. She moved swiftly. She assured that those officers will remove from the department. She took all the necessary steps. But I think race is still on the table. When a culture of policing historically has treated those from different groups differently, even when the individuals are from that same group, their culture can still exist. And we have to zero in on it, be an honest about it, and making sure that we properly train police for the realities of the cities that they are policing in. Okay. So Eric Adams wants to run for president potentially in 2024. And he's arguing that race is involved in this case. When you hear that, Buck, what do you think? His analysis is is nonsense. His analysis is what the left and the Democrats want to hear in this moment. Look, you and I expected the video to show police brutality. And it did. It was police brutality. No one isn't this. No one supports this. It should be condemned. It should be prosecuted. It makes cops jobs harder. But cops, there's hundreds. I think there's 700,000 plus sworn law enforcement officers in this country. There are going to be a handful within that, you know, almost a million who are bad people who do bad things or who cross the line or who in a moment of rage or whatever have a failing that is unacceptable and needs to be criminally prosecuted. And I just think that, you know, when they say things like this, when they say things like this, I just sent to Ali. I mean, I know it's an old, it's an older story, but I mentioned this. We'll put it up at clay and buck.com. I'll link to the video and the analysis I did at the time. This was 2017. Now going back six years clay of Daniel, the Daniel Shaver incident. Every time something like this happens and it happens to be involving a black man does not mean that it is racism. This also happens to non black individuals in this country. Daniel Shaver was one of them. And I would argue, you know, the Daniel Shaver incident was as bad as this. Actually, I, you know, it's both individuals died, but Daniel Shaver, I mean, there was, there was no, you know, there was, it was lethal force used in an incident where there absolutely should not have been I'm not, this is not what aboutism. It's just contextualization of this stuff happens and to always make it about race when there's obviously no clear correlation. There's no clear race angle. Does it disservice to the conversation we're supposed to have about how one, what does justice look like for his family? And two, what can we do now? 75% of people who are shot by police are white Asian or Hispanic 75%. You never hear about any of those incidents. By the way, most people who are shot by police are violent felons who are engaging in violent behavior. But sometimes police fail, you know, that they've buried it, but there was a study done by a Harvard economist a few years back about who is more likely in, when they control for the kind of incident you're talking about, is it more likely that cops will shoot a, a white individual or a black individual in a police involved incident with, with similar circumstances. And the economist found that it was clear that the cops are actually more likely to shoot a white individual. And the thesis was because they know if they shoot an individual who's black in the circumstances are murky at all, or it's a close call at all, their life is ruined. They may go to prison the rest of their lives. That's right. It's a great study. I read that study as well. We'll talk, take your calls, continue to discuss, uh, Clay and Buck here, 800-282-282. We gotta tell you, look, how many of you are really that comfortable that you're always going to be able to go to the grocery store and buy what you need?

The clay Travis and Vox Exten show. I don't know. I have only five and seven periods to do with you. So that was President Biden speaking to Tyree Nichols as parents. And it is true Biden has suffered a lot of personal tragedy. But I have to just point out once again that he is in a habit and in more than one instance, that a more than one occasion of lying about his personal tragedy Biden's personal tragedy for political gain or for some connection, he keeps saying, I lost my son in a war, a consequence of the war. Biden is not a gold star father. Biden did not lose his son in a war. His son Bo tragically died of cancer. It is very sad. It is tragic. And it is a tremendous loss. And that is obviously the case. But Clay, it just strikes me as as bizarre. I mean, even Biden caught himself and said, Oh, a consequence of the war in Iraq, which is also, by the way, not that's just some theory that he I mean, there's no actual science to prove that connection whatsoever. You just think it in that moment, you know, can't can't Biden in that in that deeply human moment of connecting with another family after the loss of of their son. What why? Why? Why does he feel the need to embellish or tell this story once again that everyone says is just not true? It's a great question. And it's the same story that is also tragic associated with his wife and daughter's death when he got photographed being sworn in in their in their hospital room. And the story is tragic enough. If you're a parent and you lose a child to cancer, I do think that Biden could talk to other parents about grief and loss and the impact of that upon them. But he fills the need constantly to spread lies about where and how his son died. And it's uncomfortable. And even when he's pointed out to be doing it, he continues to do it time after time. I just think Biden lies. He lies so much that he barely even notices. And even in a moment of of the most profound human connection, he still feels the need to lie, which I just think it's it's a compulsion with him at this point. My friends, the tools and resources now available to gun owners to keep your skills sharp are ever improving.

Get yours at Mantis X dot com. That's M A N T I S X dot com. Welcome back in clay Travis bucks X didn't show. We are breaking down the weekend that was appreciate all of you hanging out with us about to take a bunch of calls from police officers who wanted to weigh in based on what they based on what they saw from those videos. Also, worth noting I want to play this cut for you. They're trying to run back the defund the police slogan even though it has been roundly criticized and Democrats are now trying to say, well, we never really said that we wanted to defund the police. Hassan. How do you pronounce his name? Medi Hassan? Medi Hassan? Yeah. Medi Hassan on MSNBC says he's tired of Democrats running away from talk of abolishing and defunding the police. Here he is. You knew it was going to happen. Listen, the issue here is plenty of people have pointed out. It's not black versus white. It's blue versus the rest of which is why this whole reform nonsense from Democrats is so tiring and so dishonest. You can't reform this stuff with body cameras or diversifying the police as we just saw in Memphis. That doesn't solve the problem either. Now Democrats, of course, want to run away from talk of abolishing the police or even defunding the police. That's way too radical way to out there. But consider this the Memphis police department's response to all this controversy and camera footage on Saturday was to announce that it was disbanding the specialized police unit whose officers inflicted that brutal assault on tyrannicals, the so-called scorpion unit. Yeah, they defunded and abolished it. True. They did do that. And did you hear what he's pushing for though? I mean, this is what the left really wants. Yeah, no, that's abolition of police, folks. These people are lunatics. Just understand that the people that are making the most noise on the left about this, first of all, they never line up. Okay. What is the more urgent problem in this nation right now to deal with? What is the more the more systemic problem in this nation right now? The massive increase in homicides over the last three years over and already, depending on the country, comparing us to pretty high homicide rate, homicide rate, or the very fortunately rare, but still gut wrenching an awful instance of lethal police brutality that occurs a few times a year. They're both they're both problems of just one of them, thousands of people are dying. Yes, thousands and thousands of people are dying. Children are dying to being shot in the crossfire. So to treat all law enforcement like, I mean, this guy's basically saying, Oh, look at these cops. They were, you know, they're they're terrible. They brutalized tiring because which is true. Let's get rid of all cops, abolished police. That just means more people are going to die. No doubt. You use a viral anecdote to demand a prescription that is going to lead to a far worse outcome than what we've already had. Now, a lot of cops, but I think it's important to play that cut because almost immediately as crime rates skyrocketed in the wake of the defund the police movement, what ended up happening was Democrats said, Oh, we never ever called for defund the police. And we brought you the receipts. We played them all saying it, but it only took one viral police incident of misbehavior for that entire argument of defund the police and taking the next step of abolished police to come back. Jason in Texas, you're a police officer. Appreciate you listening. What did you think when you saw the video of the Memphis cops and of Tyree Nichols? Basically, you can hear me, right? Yeah, we got you. Okay, basically, I'm a 20 year veteran. And I've been in Texas all my life. And I can tell you right now, over the 20 years of my career, law enforcement has changed along with the environment. Okay, we used to be respected and all this other good stuff. But we really didn't have to do as much to deter crime because people didn't acting like a normal cop. I mean, we're trained constantly to learn how to restrain people without throwing blows or fighting like they do. You know what I'm saying? I mean, we're supposed to be more professional than that. And we have techniques Carl Magog, you did too. You name it. Think when you saw police officers literally holding the guy up to take shots, punches, I mean, in the in the feed, I mean, it felt like a gangland style hit. Very, it looked like a gang it looked like a gang beatdown. They kicked him in the face when he was on the ground. That piece I've talked to about this, because we all look at it and we criticize, you know, but we usually try and hold out, you know, our opinions until we see everything. Well, when I saw everything, I immediately was like, well, okay, these guys have been doing this for a while. And nobody said anything to them. Nobody's done anything to punish them for it. The problem I see now is that I guarantee you're going to have all kinds of complaints come out of the woodwork now that have been before. And if they haven't been addressed in the past, some heads are going to turn. These guys, yeah, these guys were not trained like cops usually are well, if they were trained, they weren't using their training. Good. Yeah, look, it was, it was thank you for calling in. Thank you for calling in. It's this is police brutality. That is what we saw in the video. I haven't seen anyone. I haven't seen honestly a single person try to make a case about anything other than than that. This is clearly cops who crossed the line. I mentioned the Daniel Shaver case. There was also there's the case where the officer shot a man running away in the back. It was in daylight on video and I believe it was South Carolina. That was an officer crossing the line. That was that officer went away for murder as he should have. It does happen. It's very rare though. And one of the ways that we get bad outcomes in terms of policy and in terms of takeaways, Clay from all this is that there is a distortion, an intentional distortion that the left engages in. Let's take an example of this. If if someone finds a a a noose on a college campus, right, just to go to the a different kind of incident, all of a sudden there's there's 350 million people give or take in this country, 340 million. We're all supposed to have a conversation about how racist America is one noose in one place. The whole country is racist. And even when it's sometimes often is the case on college campus. Oh, a person who put the noose there actually is himself a minority and was trying to raise awareness. So it wasn't even a hate crime. It was a fake hate crime. We're still supposed to have the conversation about how racist the country is. And you say, well, hold on a second. Is that something that occurs frequently? Is that something that occurs at a scale where we think that that's the normal? Of course not. It's incredibly rare. But we're supposed to treat the incredibly rare like it's actually quite common so that certain people in the country can get their way and have power. The left the Democrats, they do this all the time. Even when it's not remotely race related to bubble Wallace, pool rope and NASCAR. Remember the guy in California? I think it was who had a rope on it like in a noose that he was using as a workout tool in a public park. I mean, even when these things as you said are not remotely related to race at all, they're supposed to all lecture us about the importance of having the conversation anyway. But it's supposed to also show us Oh, look at how common this is. Yeah, look at what's going on in America today and ever sits there and says, this isn't going on. This isn't a common thing at all actually. One of the fastest ways to ruin your life in this country, one of the fastest ways the fastest is to just probably probably I mean, you know, short of like, you know, building. Yeah, is to do something that is actually truly racist, one of the fastest ways to destroy your reputation, make you unhireable, get you kicked out of school, fired from your job. That is actually the country we live in. And yet if you watch MSNBC, everything is racist. Clay, the Fed raising interest rates is right. Find me something that they talk about. And I'll show you MSNBC making it a racial incident or racial implications of some kind. Mel in North Carolina, retired cop. What did you see? Hey, how's it going? We're paying down. I appreciate you calling. Um, you know, after looking at all these things since I quit, which was back in the mid 80s, and I'm 63 now, like the previous caller said, there's been a lot of changes in the atmosphere of the people. And there's obviously some, a lot of variances within the training of police officers from one city to one state to another. So it's almost come to my mind. And I'm not in that category to abolish police because I'm very lawful in client, but at the same token to have consistency and continuity across the board, no matter what state you live in, it's almost to the point that I think they do need to do some type of restructuring and maybe put the National Guard in charge in every single town. And what it used to be or what is currently would then become the police department. That's kind of like the the the fill ins or the, what do you call it? Like a volunteer EMTs, they would be volunteer police people that would be available upon call or something. But the National Guard, I just think would would be consistently trained no matter what state you're in, they know how to handle the string situations. And I do. Are you talking like to do with riots or you say suggesting for day to day day to day police, we don't want the military doing day to day policing. That's not gonna, that's not a good solution here. Yeah. I think it's a bad solution. I appreciate the call, respectfully, that's, you know, because ultimately, you're just transferring the responsibilities and the force. This is why when AOC, remember AOC was saying abolish ICE. Yes. And then everyone would say, well, that's like, what do you want to abolish all immigration laws? Right. They said, no, we're going to build a new thing that's not ICE that will do all the same things that ICE does. And you say, okay, well, that's not going to help anything. In fact, what the government usually does is just create the new thing to duplicate the mission and put more resources into it overall. And then you just have an even more efficient and inefficient and expensive bureaucracy with the same problems. John in New York quickly here, you're a retired police chief. What did you think? How would you have responded if this had been on your force and you had seen video like this? I've hired a lot of cops and I've fired cops and I got to tell you, I saw them retain nothing from their academy training. And the other thing most people don't know is most academies, I worked at the county, state and federal level and I went to three academies and I could tell you most academies mirror department of justice guidelines. So they were taught DOJ principles and they did nothing but thawdery right there. And the question I don't see anybody saying or addressing is leadership. I mean, I heard it once or twice, but that's paramount in this. Where was the sergeant? Where was the lieutenant? And everybody right up to the chief needs to be held accountable. If it happened on my watch, in my department, I'd have been fired and I was the chief of my service at the federal level. Thank you for calling in. That's that that tracks with every law enforcement officer that I've talked to privately about this friends of mine reached out to. So I think that that is that is the accurate assessment of what we saw, which was these cops were way over the line, obviously over line. And when people say things like, oh, body cams, well, no body cams, body cams aren't going to make everything perfect. But there's there's going to be some justice now because of body without body cameras, who knows? Yeah, so there are other forms that have been made that, you know, I'm most cops that I've talked to said they like that there are body cameras, because you know what it does? It prevents frivolous lying abuse complaints against the cop as well when that is the case, right? So there are things that have been done. Now you can still have cops turn off their body cams as they did for a small portion of that. But we caught it from the light tower in that neighborhood so that there was an additional feed of what was going on. But you could tell even with the body cams that were running for the vast majority of this tape that they had behaved in an illegal man, you really don't want to be the cop explaining to internal affairs why during an arrest where there's an allegation of severe use of for or you know, abuse of force while your body camera just mysteriously turned off. All five got turned off. You don't want to be you don't want to be telling internal affairs that, trust me. You know, friends, I'm getting married. It's coming weekend.

I'm going to talk to you about a situation in in New York that I think some of us probably would have anticipated or thought would that would happen. You have migrants who are in a I believe it's a four star hotel. Perhaps it's a three star. So there may not be an indoor in indoor pool and and room service. But it's a nice hotel in Midtown and they are they've been living there for weeks, perhaps months at taxpayer expense. And they have been asked to change facilities. Is any does anyone want to take a guess as to whether the people who came into the country knowingly and illegally to abuse our system to pretend to be asylum seekers who have been put up in hotels in the middle of Manhattan at taxpayer expense. Does anyone want to guess if they're really eager to comply with the request to move to another facility? We'll just put that one out there for a second. I'll just remind everybody. Tell bot. It's a four star hotel. It is a four star. Okay. How many people listening to us right now have ever stayed in a four star hotel in Manhattan? Like a four star hotel in Manhattan is you know 200 plus dollars and now depending on whoa, whoa, more like 350 and up my friend 350 and up. Oh man here.
