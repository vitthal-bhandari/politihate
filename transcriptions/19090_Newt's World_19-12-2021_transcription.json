New Era of 3-Row Luxury, the Lexus TX. Experience amazing at your Lexus dealer. What could wake up in you if you're over 50? Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about Shingle's prevention. In this episode of New York World, you're going to get to meet somebody who I have found to be one of the most fascinating and interesting personalities that we've ever had on the podcast. I'm confident that as you get to know her, that you're going to have the same reaction I did, which is that she's just a remarkable original, totally her own person, and a great contribution to the diversity and the energy and the ideas that make up America. She is Virginia Lieutenant Governor-elect, Win some Sears. And I must say, when I recently saw her speak at the American Legislative Exchange Council, you could have heard a pin drop every single person in that room was paying total attention to her, and she was earning it because she's so fascinating. So thank you for joining me today, Win some of my very grateful. And I think the achievement of Virginia Republicans winning back the Governor's Mansion is one of the most exciting races we've seen in a long time. And we'll talk about it at first. I think we ought to talk about you, because I think you are in your own right, a phenomenon. Now, as I understand it, you were born in Kingston, Jamaica, in March of 1964, and you immigrated to the U.S. when you were six years old in 1970, and from then on, it became an American success story. But can you tell us a little bit about your dad and coming to the U.S. at that early age? Yes, Mr. Speaker, thank you for having me on. It's great to be with you, and I tell you, you never can plan your life because I never know, million years that I would be before you now speaking. So it really is truly an honor. So my father came to America in 1963, August 11, 17 days before Martin Luther King, Jr. gave his I Have a Dream speech. And so I said to my father, why would you come then? Because, you know, it was a very hard time for us, and for those who don't know yet, I'm black. And my father is black, too. And he said, because this is where the opportunities were, I said, yeah, but you came at the height of the civil rights movement. And he said, this is still where the jobs were. And so, he only came with $1.75. And in fact, I'll tell you, you couldn't remember if he came with $1.50 or $1.75. So I'm spotting him a quarter. But anyway, he came and took a new job he could find. He moved in with his sister when he came. And got roommates, moved out six months afterwards, and put himself through school with the money that he made. And started his American dream, you know, bought his house, et cetera, et cetera. And now he's comfortably retired. And, you know, I say all that to say that, remember when my father came at the height of the civil rights movement. You want to talk about dog whistles? Okay, there was that. The firehoses, there was that. But you know what he didn't do, Mr. Speaker? He did not go back home. No, he did not. He said, this is where the opportunities were. And he was going to take advantage of them. And we did. Because you see, racism is everywhere, is it not? Racism is in every country. If it's not racism, it's colorism. And we're the black community can tell you about that all day long. There wasn't so long ago when if you were not light-skinned, that you could not join certain black organizations. So we need to get up that high horse that we have. And if it's not colorism, it's tribalism. If it's not tribalism, it's classism. It is whatever it is because we're human beings and we divide ourselves. We have a second church. I may not be what I'm supposed to be, but I ain't what I used to be. And that's America. She may not be what she's supposed to be, but surely she ain't what she used to be. Look at me. I am here. And I was not even born here. I came off the plane. I am still the immigrant. My children are first generation Americans. So you can say, and I've heard people say, that you can come here and then in one generation, you can be president of the United States. Well, I am the same generation that got off the plane. And my same getting off the plane. I am a second in command in Virginia. I am going to be the lieutenant governor. And that's the greatness of America. So I want to go back now. Here's this six year old girl getting off the plane as you put it. Where were you all living? We lived in the Bronx. And I can tell you it was a bit traumatic for me because remember I came from sun all day long. And the matter of the season, it was always sunny. And Jamaica, you don't ever ask, how's the weather? The weather is always hot and sunny. And then I'm used to walking barefoot in the grass and fruit trees and season all the time. And I come to another country, there's snow on the ground and the culture is different, the smells are different. Everything is different. And it was very traumatic for me. Very traumatic. But here I am, I got used to it apparently. I just have to ask this because of my own background. So did you go to the Bronx Zoo since you lived in the Bronx? Yes, we did everything that was American because you want to be an American. You want to adapt. And this is America. And we didn't come here to be separate. We came here to succeed. That was the whole purpose. The opportunities are here despite the other issues. And so when we talk about racism, you know, it's just one more hurdle. And we'll get over it. So your dad took any job he couldn't put himself through school and you went through school. Yes. And then you decide at the age of 19 to join the US Marine Corps. Now why did you decide to become a Marine? Well, I tell you, had it not been for my grandmother, I would not have joined the Army and the Corps. In the class, I had graduated from New York High School early and my classes were set and I was supposed to start college that August. I was all set to go, had my books ready, had everything ready. But then my grandmother died that July, that same year, July. And I looked at her in the CANSG and I went back to Jamaica for her funeral. I looked at her and I thought, what is the purpose of my life? She died when I was 18. I thought, if you're just going to die, then I'm just going to die myself. And I remembered that the Marines really could help me. And in fact, there was a jet magazine in Jamaica on my mother's coffee table and then I picked it up and it fell to the few, the proud Marines. And I said, well, if anybody can give me a reason to live, it's going to be the Marine Corps. And I joined because I needed the discipline and because America had been so good to me. You served both as an electrician and as a diesel mechanic, which had to be a range of learning you hadn't quite expected when you saw that picture. Well, I tell you, I became an electrician and we always have to repair the floodlights and the generators. And so you had to also become a diesel mechanic too. And I did that because I'd heard my grandfather say to older grandkids that a college degree is wonderful, but get a trained because then they can't take that from you. And that's because he grew up in the depression and the lawyers had work if he had a trade. So although I have my master degree now, I do have the ability from time to time, you know, to diagnose a few things. How did it feel being in the Marine Corps? Oh, it was wonderful because I just gravitate to discipline. I suppose I gravitate to authority. I gravitate to leaders. And that's what the Marine Corps did for me. It gave me the discipline. In the authority, I'm not a big bad woman, as we might say. I'm quite petite, but when you have rank, you have authority. And I got to tell these great big, hulking guys once I started picking up rank, we've got to do this, this and this and then they respected the rank. And that taught me something else as well that once you're given leadership, then you don't abuse it. And in fact, you try to make more leaders. It lightens your burden, certainly. And it develops others in their natural talents because you can't do it by yourself. And I saw leadership modeled for me when I saw, for example, we had an inspector general's inspection and most people who have been in the military know that you don't want to fail these. And so we were working very hard, very hard. And one night, the morning officer came out and gave us a pep talk. But I tell me what he did after that. He took off his wonderful uniform and put on his candies and his utilities and was out there moving equipment and working on equipment with the rest of us. And he got more out of us that night than he had all the days previous. And I said to myself, okay, understand about that too. You have to model leadership and you have to be willing to do a grunt work so that you can get the respect. And in the range, you know, as a woman, men have natural tendencies to more protect women. And so they would want to help me dig the ditch or dig it for me. But I understand. If I let them do that, I would not earn their respect. And so I had to dig my own ditch. I think Israel has it right where they require of every citizen that they serve their country for two years. And I think that's probably what's missing in our everyday lives in America. We always think now that the country owes us something when we are the ones who will keep the country, the great country that she should be, whether it's Peace Corps or whether you join the military. I think we ought to require of our citizens at least two years to make your country great. When you think back to all this, if you had not gone in the Marine Corps, do you think you'd be a dramatically different person today? I think I would simply because I love the Lord and He's a great part of my life. I understand according to the Bible that my steps are ordered by Him. So I think whatever path I would have taken, I think I would have ended up here no matter what, but He is the Reeds. So when you get out of the Corps, you really invested in education. I went to Tidewater Community College and you graduated from Old Dominion and then you got an MA and an organizational leadership at Regent University. So you spent a lot of time learning. Ever since I was a little kid, I loved arguing. I thought I was making points, but my parents and everybody said, well, you were arguing all the time. You always wanted to know why you had to do something. I was preparing to tell my mother now, but I always wanted to be a lawyer. And when I left the Marine Corps, I thought about that again and I didn't want to be 40. I was a speaker and wondered what if? And so I went back to school. But you see, by that time, I already had three children. They were under five and I figured I was maybe 26 when I went back to get my college degree so that I could move on to becoming a lawyer that I thought I wanted to be. And no one can tell me that I had it easy. Again, three children under five. My husband and I, my husband took a lower paying job so that he could be home more with the children so that I could go to school. We sold one of our vehicles so that we could reduce the cost of living for us because I wasn't working. And it was a hard time for us. I put one of my girls, the last one, on the back of our bicycle in the carrier because we were using one vehicle. And took heart of daycare. The other kids went to school. So, you know, I came up the hard way. But I wanted to get somewhere in order to get there. I was going to need the knowledge to get there. And eventually I was accepted to law school, but something changed. What happened, I ran the whole of shelter. And I just saw for them that maybe I didn't want to really be the attorney. I wanted to be the person who is arguing things, arguing. That's what I like to do. I like to make points and research and all that. And so the very next year after I was accepted to law school and I decided not to go, I was elected. So what I was going to do as an attorney, I was going to work within a system that I was given. But then I ended up creating the system. So it was very interesting. Well, I don't think I'd ever heard that story. Were you shocked? When I won? Well, I saw that things weren't being done the way that I thought they could be. For example, my representative didn't seem to care what we thought. Nobody ever knocked on my door and asked me for my opinion on the issues. And I didn't see it happen anywhere else. And I was asked to run and I thought, you know, after I played about it, yes, I'm going to run. And remember now I ran in a 58% black district, 62% Democrat overall. And I ran against an incumbent who had been there for 20 years. His father had the seat before him 11 years. So 33 year dynasty in the family and only had three months to run. And I had no money. But you know, we did it. I couldn't have done it by myself. I had a lot of volunteers and we did it. It's a little bit like the story of Ed Doer, Jr., who beat the state Senate president in New Jersey. I believe Republicans should ignore blue district, et cetera. And say, if I can find the right candidate with the right heart willing to work hard enough, anybody is potentially vulnerable. And it must have been a huge shock to both the Democrats and the Republicans when you won, because the Democrats didn't think they could lose. And the Republicans didn't think they could win. I mean, did that automatically draw attention for you when you got to Richmond? Because you sort of stood out as a remarkable candidate. Again, I didn't seek anything. And I wasn't thinking about making history when I ran. I just knew that somebody had to challenge him. And that somebody should be me. Why not mean nobody else was stepping up? And so I did. And when I won it, certain things happened. I became the first black Republican woman ever elected to the General Assembly. I was also the first female immigrant, Republican Democrat. It doesn't matter. I also was the first female veteran, Marine Corps. What was more important, I think, than anything else is that I was the first Republican to represent a majority minority district since 1865. So let people know that we can have Republicans represent black districts, Asian districts, you know, majority, whatever, Latino, that we should never, ever not go and talk with everybody. We should never concede people to Democrats. We have the better ideas. And if you never go and talk to the population, then it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. And it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. And if you're not going to vote for you, you've got to come and make the case. I think Republican Party ought to start thinking about itself as a business. A business needs customers. You don't care where your customers are coming from, you go find your customers. And if your customers are listening to a certain legal program, go pay for time there. If they're reading certain newspapers, go advertise there. If they're in certain restaurants, go find them there. Go and find your customers so that your business will survive.

It's fascinating to me because you did have this great upset victory and you were representing a district very effectively but then you decided to tackle Democratic Congressman Bobby Scott and you got 31% of the vote. How did you reconcile the ability on the one hand to win the statehouse seat but on the other hand being in a match with a system which is very, very hard to break through. It was a bigger district. It was a much bigger district. I was not as known up in the Richmond area. In fact, there were people after the election. They never knew me. I never received the money that I couldn't have to make a bigger dent and I saw that as I was making the rounds and trying to tell people about his terrible record where in fact he had voted that you could have computer simulated choppernography because it was a first amendment right and when I tried to tell people about that, they didn't believe me and I didn't have the money to get that message through. He also voted that it would be all right for someone to take your underage daughter out of the state for an abortion and just bring her back as if nothing happened. I couldn't get the message out because we didn't have the money. It was really the same thing happening that happened in my delegate race that I won where I couldn't get the money because nobody believed that I could do it. But when you have a more contiguous district and a smaller district, you can make a bigger impact I think. But when your district stretches from one end of it to the other, it's very hard. People just didn't believe that he had such a bad record and he had so many other things that just couldn't get it done. When that happened, you went on to start a plumbing electrical and appliance repair business started taking advantage of what you learned in the Marine Corps. You became the owner of a small business. What was that experience like? As you think about it and you think about other people who want to go out and start a small business, what's your advice? Well, life is not easy. If there's something you want to do, I say go for it. Go for it. Don't get to be 80 years old and wonder what if. That goes with anything. Just do it. That is the limit of possibilities. As my grandmother always used to say, there's nothing that leads a try but a failure. If you fail, what does it mean except that you try? If it's not that, then it's something else. Thomas Edison said he had what a thousand ways he figured out and lots to do something. Just go ahead and try. That's what I did. There's nothing in my life that has ever been easy. As I said, this is just one more obstacle. This is what I want to do. This is what I'm going to do. I started with a phone number and the name. More employees, no nothing. In fact, I really didn't know very much about the business because it was mostly appliance repair and plumbing. I don't know anything about those things, but I found the people and I knocked on doors to introduce my business. I joined lead exchanges to build the business. By the way, I started my business in the great recession. I started it and we grew to be just about half a million dollar company in an industry. I knew nothing about it. I'm used to tackling the difficult things, but I'm not special. We all have difficulties in our lives. As I've said before, there are times when you're the pigeon and other times you're the statue. It's just the way life is. You've got to keep going. America is the place to try new things. You also had a strong civic sense because while you're running a small business, you're also director of a homeless shelter of the Salvation Army. Then you've led a men's prison ministry. You seem to have a desire to be a good citizen and to contribute to the community in ways that are very, very important and very human. I think that comes from what I saw. My grandmothers who are very giving people and I remember being jealous that we didn't have their attention all the time as children I want to do. Then I thought I would never be like them. Rondi Holt, I'm just like them learning to give of yourself. As a Christian, it's required of us. I think at a certain point, your heart takes over and you want to help. I think in that we have to be very careful because you come to realize that although you want to help people, you can be an enabler instead of someone who helps and you have to understand the difference. When you see that people are maybe abusing your help or you understand that they're not even trying themselves, it's like a drowning man. You have to wait until he's tired. Then you can help him. Otherwise he'll bring you down with him. Same thing. You can hear that you can bring a horse to water but you can't make him drink. You've got to sometimes cut times because obviously they haven't hit bottom yet. There is this thing about being a good person, a kind person, but also try not to be an enabler. Don't have somebody be a failure. I talked to people, for example, from California where the scale of the homeless encampments now is just breathtaking. You could wave a magic wand. What would you do about the homeless to enable them to get out of these camps and get back to life? I remember one day I was in Richmond here in Virginia and there was snow on the ground about a foot. I drove by a man who was in the snow. He was in the bus, felt there and you could tell he was homeless. I drove back around the block, came back around and stopped. I sent him, you don't have to be out here in the cold. You can go to the Salvation Army Hill and shelter. It's just down the street. He said to me, stop me right away. He said, I don't want to go there. They have too many rules. I drove off because I understood. I couldn't help him. I gave him an opportunity. He didn't want to take it because he said there are too many rules. It's because he's a real breaker why he is where he is. Another day I was in Washington, D.C. and I saw a man standing there begging. I went over to him and I said, I want to give you the money but I'll buy food for you. I sent him, following me across the street to the McDonald's and I'll go ahead and buy you whatever you want. He said to me, Mr. Speaker, he said, I'm not eating over there today. I'm eating here today. Do you know what here was? The 10-dollars sandwich place. That's what it was eating. So he wanted me to leave him alone and buy my own business. Meantime, I was eating at the McDonald's. I was at the dollar menu. You see what I'm saying? But I'm not the homeless one. And so I think we know that the homeless population, they are mostly addicts or they have mental health issues. So we have to figure out how to help the addicts separate from the ones who have mental health issues. And then there are quite a few veterans, by the way, who are homeless. Now we have to go and talk with the people and find out what's going on. But they cannot be on the side of the street, suffocating. We are a civilized society. Something has to be done. And better minds than mine will have to come up with a strategy. But we also have to remember that the people are adults. And Jesus said, the poor you will have with you always. And until somebody hits rock bottom, you cannot help them. I've just given you two very good examples. So you continued in this passion for public service. You were vice president of the Virginia State Board of Education. As you look back on that experience, what's your sense of what we have to do to fix our school systems? Well, I tell you that no matter what position I've held, I've always asked myself, what would somebody want to know and want to accomplish who has my current position? So I would say to myself, what would a parent ask the superintendent standing in front of them? What would a parent ask the principal, the school board member standing in front of them? My questions were always really straight into the point. Why is the school failing? Why are the children not learning? Tell me about your curriculum and what needs to improve. Your school has been failing for five years. What have you done to change things? My questions were always very straight, very to the point. I think that what we need to do when it comes to education is we have to have competition, plain and simple. In my business, I would have loved it, loved it. If when you move into my zip code, you could only use my business and my business only. Oh boy, that would have been wonderful. That's not the way the real world works. Why is that okay when it comes to K through 12 education? The minute that I move into a certain zip code, my children can only attend this elementary school, this middle school and this high school. I have no choice. And everybody knows I have no choice. The only choice I ever have when it comes to education is if I can move my children, I have district pay for them or if I can send them to a private school or whatever. That's no competition then. And the people who advocate that it's public school and public school only, they live in neighborhoods where the school system is great or they live where they can have choice by paying for private school. So I say we need competition and education. Now, you will hear people say, well, you shouldn't have public monies spent towards private schools. But let's wait a minute. Let's think about this. Don't we have public monies going to private businesses? Of course we do. Section 8, rental vouchers. The government gives public money to landlords. Private landlords, right? That comes to SNAP benefits. Food benefits, the government gives public money so that the person can take it to a private grocery store. And by food, when it comes to Medicaid and Medicare, the government gives public monies to any doctor, hospital, et cetera. And think about this, financial aid. We don't tell a child that you must go to the college or university that's closest to years ago. No, we tell them go anywhere, even out of state. Public money is going towards private institutions, less summer state, yes, summer government. And why is it in the K through 12 area that we're limited? And this is the foundational years. It makes no sense to me. So we need competition and we need it now. The market has been brutal. We're all filling it. Last year, stocks performed worse in 2022 than in the 2008 financial crisis.

So my husband Michael and I just took an amazing road trip to the iHeart Radio Music Festival in Vegas. And thanks to Hyundai, we were able to record a special episode just for you guys along the way. We're so excited to take you on this journey with us. You're not going to want to miss this one right babe. No you won't. Here's a quick preview. You can listen now wherever you get your podcasts. Oh, I love memory lane. Let's go down. It goes back to the NSYNC tour bus day. Look, I love to be on the tour bus. I don't sleep better than when I'm on a bus. And then your friends get to join you on the road and family. That was always fun because especially during the height of NSYNC, my friends are in college. So they would jump on the road with us a few dates and have the best time ever. But I also had to share a bus with Joey Fatone. But the good thing is eventually when we made it, we had a bus at a shower on it. This episode is brought to you by the All Electric Hyundai IONIQ 5 and IONIQ 6. I'm curious, what led you to decide to be the national chairperson for black Americans to re-elect President Trump? Well, as a lot of people have said, you can like the policy, the personalities, and other things. But we're not seeing results. And it's the same reason why 24% of black men voted for President Trump because they saw results. And there are other people who voted for him, Latinos saw results. There were a lot of things he said that I thought, oh God, I wish he had the said that. Or a tweet, oh, I wish he had the said that. But when we saw that black entrepreneurship increased to a point that we had never seen historically, 400% increased because of his policies. And we saw that he was giving money to historical black colleges and universities that he restored in fact the money that President Obama had taken away. And then he provided a permanent funding stream so that the HBCUs wouldn't have to keep coming back to the federal government every year had in hand. We really don't think he did. And then let's talk about visionary form. You know, the black population is an ardently represented in the present population. We've not gained so much and changed so much. And so it is my wonder that he got so many black votes that you have to go all the way back to President Nixon to see that kind of result. So I thought, you know, we're going to work on the personality or something. And then you have our hope for America, what a market to be great. And so many immigrants gravitated to that because America has to be great because what else is there? You see what's happening in England and you know, I don't know about Canada. China is scheduled to be the number one superpower as the economist tell us by the year 2030. And we can't allow that to happen. And so I went and I tried to raise money so that we could get an elected. So coming off that though, you then made the decision that you'd run for lieutenant governor. I realize that this courage all through your life, but that's still a pretty big decision to make. What led you to decide that this was the right year and that you were just going to put your name out there? Well, you know, I actually never wanted to be lieutenant governor. When I left politics, I was done. I figured it's time for everybody else to be on the stage. It's time for somebody else to come up with all the answers of how we can achieve world peace. I just want to relax and enjoy my life and do what I wanted to do for a change. But there comes a point where you see things that are not right and you say, well, you can either light a candle or you can curse the darkness. And to curse the darkness is to be a victim. But to light a candle is to find a solution. And I always believe there's a solution out there. And apparently I was the solution. But I stepped forward because as I looked at the educational squares, I saw that the kids were not learning. And I looked at my apartments and I thought, we're going to lose again. And we can't afford to lose as Republicans anymore. We had made great strides into the immigrant community, Latino community, the black community, and we needed to keep that. We can't keep winning the same people over and over again. But as I said, education was it for me. And so I came back into politics. I've been gone for 20 years. And it was time. It was time for me to look back in and offer my services and see if the people would hire me again. It was fascinating. I watched that campaign very closely and particularly stayed in close touch with Jeff Rowe, who was running the young kids campaign. And I watched you guys. And it just seemed to me that between you and Jason Mayari is running for the Attorney General's slot, in a sense, you totally broke up the left's normal attack on the Duncan, which would have been, of course, that he was somehow a white racist, et cetera. That became so absurd that I think it was a significant part of how the breakthrough occurred and why you all were able to win. I thought it was a very, very good campaign where all three of you did a superb job of representing yourselves, but also representing a ticket more than often happens in Virginia politics. And on election night, when you were standing in front of your cheering supporters at a victory party, you said, I'm quoting you, what you are looking at is the American dream. Now that must have been a moment of just extraordinary excitement for you and your family. Yes, it was because all I wanted to do was serve. I wasn't trying to make history. In fact, I wasn't even thinking about that. You know how it is when you run for office. You've got to have that fire in the belly. If you don't have it, you are just not going to make it. And every insult that you get as you run is going to mess with your mind. So you have to make up in your mind that this is what you want to do, that you have the better ideas and come, you know, as they say, hell, our high water, you're going to get to the finish line. That's what we did. We thought that we had the better ideas that we could bring some change where the children will be able to learn where we could have safe neighborhoods, safe communities where we could get our economy back on track. You know, you probably saw where CNBC had said that Virginia was number one when it comes to business. And that's because they threw in a lot of social justice stuff in there. That doesn't make a dime for anybody, but it makes certain people feel good. But it doesn't put any money in anybody's pocket. And that's what we're talking about. People being able to make choices for themselves. And then another thing that my room did, those of us who are black or Asian or whatever we are, we got to say that we can be Republicans. We can be anything we want to be. And by the way, we're not asking anybody's permission because this is America. People look at me and they immediately think, oh, Democrat, now, what kind of power do I have? Not. So I ran also, told people listen, it's okay to believe anything you want to believe in. First of all, you're kind of a human force. You remind me of a handful of people I've known like Jack Kemp, where you just, you fill the space. And in a way, it changed me that you're virtually fearless. I don't know about that. There's a lot of fear involved, but you've got to push it to the side. Well, then you're very courageous. I don't know about that either. I think if I'm on the side of right, if I have guided my life, then I'll be just fine. But I win or lose. I win anyway, even if they tell me I've lost. Look, I hope that after you've had a little while in office and you have begun to get the things done, you believe in that you'll come back and join us again. I think you're going to become an important national figure. I think that you have both in your personal life and your personality, in your commitment, in your willingness to work really hard. You have just a lot of characteristics of real leadership. And I'm really looking forward to seeing you and Glenn Yunken leading the Commonwealth of Virginia. And I know that they're going to be very exciting things ahead for the state and that you're going to be part of that excitement. Well, I hope to have the voters be thankful that they voted for me because I'm thankful to them that they're giving me a chance to show them how true servant leadership can be because I've seen it mildly and I've seen what's not good about politicians who don't care for the people who forget that we elected the politician and the politician is supposed to come back and be accountable to us and not the way around. And we need to stop worshipping our political leaders. This is America. And I'll do that. I think you've got it exactly right. And I really appreciate knowing all the different things you've got to get done between now and your inauguration. I really appreciate you're taking the time. And I think that this podcast is going to be listened to very carefully by a lot of folks. And I'm going to make sure that a number of Republicans around the country get it because they need to learn the lesson that if you got courage and you go out there, you know, don't worry in advance about what kind of district it is. Worry about reaching out to the people and you're living proof both in your state legislative race and then again, in the governor that if you got the courage to go out and do it, if you want to work hard, that's amazing what you can get done. And go and find your voters. Go and find your customers and don't go for the vote. Go for the heart. Move and don't care how much you know until they know how much you care. And if you want to say that's fine, but go and find your customers. This is a business. Go and introduce your ideas. You're going to find that there are more people who believe in the American dream, who believe that there are certain ways to be, that you don't throw good money after bad, but you can help people who don't want to help themselves, that if you find somebody who really needs to help, let them. Don't say, well, that's one of the population will never vote with us. How do you know? Don't become a self-fulfilling prophecy. And if the first you don't succeed, try again. See, the old ways are still the better ways. That's right. And I ran twice in the last before I won and I tried to elect a majority every two years from 1980 until we finally did it in 94. So I'm living proof that if you just keep pounding away, sometimes you break through and that's maybe part of why I'm so attracted to you is that you have that same spirit. And I think you're going to prove to be a great leader. And I just want to know, I'm very grateful you were this today. And I am going to call on you after you've had about a year of this experience and say, would you come back and chat with me and help people understand what you're learning? Because I think you're going to learn a lot and you're going to achieve a lot. I hope you have a wonderful holiday with your family. Thank you. And Merry Christmas to you.
