    "text": " Welcome. Welcome to Fairless with Jason Whitlock. I am Jason Whitlock, your host. Happy Monday to you and yours. Happy Monday. Happy start of the week to you. And we have a great week of shows playing for you today. And we're going to get off to an awesome start today on Monday. What a better day to get off to a good start than at the beginning of the week. Royce White will be here as well. Steve Kim, the Korean Co-Sail. They'll be here today. We got a tightly bunched, powerful show. We're going to talk about Tim Anderson, Tony LaRusa, and Josh Donaldson. We're going to talk about Tiger Woods and what happened to him at the PGA Championship. We're going to talk about my favorite left-wing comedian, Bill Maher. I've been a fan of Bill Maher for close to 15, 20 years. And the guy just keeps coming further and further over to my way of thinking. And we'll talk about that with Steve Kim as well. But we're going to start with baseball, which we don't normally do. But something fascinating has happened in the baseball world. And so I'm going to start a fire about what happened in the baseball world. And then we're going to bring Royce White into fan those flames. So let's get it started without further ado. Tony LaRusa, he's a baby groomer. His pronouns are they and them. The legendary 77-year-old baseball skipper and best friend of Bob Knight and Bill Parcells has apparently bowed to the social media and social justice winds and reinvented himself as a groomer. He's overseen the transition of the Chicago White Sox into a sixth grade girls softball team. Adhering to left his custom, Chicago's lone African-American player, Tim Anderson, volunteered to be the first major leaguer to sacrifice his stick and balls. Saturday night, Anderson erupted in anger and emotion because a member of the New York Yankees, Josh Donaldson, trawled him with the nickname Jackie, a reference to the Hall of Famer, Jackie Robison. Three years ago, in a sports illustrated interview, Anderson analogized himself to the baseball pioneer who integrated Major League Baseball in 1947. Anyone remotely familiar with sports culture isn't surprised that Anderson's opponents would use the analogy to rib the shortstop. LaRusa has been involved with professional baseball for 59 years. He made his Major League debut in 1963 with the Kansas City Athletics. An infielder, LaRusa is acutely aware of the kind of banter players use to get inside the head of an opponent. Jackie is quite possibly the tamous and lamest insult ever uttered on a baseball diamond, football field, basketball court, soccer pitch, or ice hockey rink. LaRusa compared it to one of the worst. Here's Tony LaRusa describing the grave insult of being called Jackie. So you may have racist count that Donaldson and that's all I'm going to say. That's pretty strong. That's as strong as it gets. LaRusa turned a routine bench clearing standoff into a Black Lives Matter debate. To no one's shot, Tim Anderson embraced the role of baby George Floyd with a heavy dose of Jesse Smollett. Anderson loves attention. He's a bat flipping show boat. Here's him leaning into the controversy. He started LaRusa Fuel and now Anderson is taking to the next level. Well, as I said, when you guys got past the charts right there, you can't just say, yeah, what happened in the first, the first time I got on, you know, when I spared them that time, and it happened again. You know, it was just, you know, it was just uncalled for. You know, it's not like a time to, you know, be playing like that. I didn't mention it continue. You know, I don't know, to be honest, you know, I don't know to be honest. You know, it was very disrespectful, you know, I don't want to play like that. You probably disrespectful to somebody who said it was racist. If you're gonna say it, say it with your chest stuck out. Don't say it with your head there. It was disrespectful. I don't play like that. It was disrespectful. Yeah. He knows what he's saying is a crocke do-do. That's why he won't make eye contact with anybody. And that's why he's mumbling and he doesn't say it with his chest out. Anderson overreacted to Donaldson's harmless jab. The race card justified Anderson's on-field blow-up, put Donaldson on the defensive, and summoned Major League Baseball to launch an investigation. I'd love to know what exactly the league is going to investigate. Donaldson, cop to calling Anderson Jackie. Listen for yourself. All right. So first thing I called him Jackie. So let me give you a little context of that. 2019, he came out with interviews, said that he's a new Jackie Robinson of baseball. He's gonna bring back fun for the game, right? And 2019 when I played for Elena, we actually joked about that on the game. I don't know what's changed from, and I've said it to him years past. Not in any manner, they're just joking around, for the fact that he called himself Jackie Robinson. So if something has changed from that, my meaning of that is not any term of trying to be racist, by any fact of the matter. It was just off of an interview that what he called himself. And we said that before we joked about it, he laughed, whatever. What is there to investigate? I mean, seriously, what's the investigation going to entail? And why is the media playing along with this? What needs to be investigated is the public mutilation of Anderson's genitals. Three years ago in the Sports Illustrated article where he compared himself to Jackie Robinson, Anderson proudly boasted about calling royals pitcher Brad Keller a weak ass effing inward. He called Keller a weak ass effing inward. Anderson received a one game suspension for that derogatory attack. Keller is white. I'm sure the light discipline given to Anderson for that bit of racism caught the attention of many white major league players. Anderson's defiance surely registered too. It's also difficult to miss Anderson's delusion and or racial dysphoria in the Sports Illustrated piece. Anderson and the writer, a woman named Stephanie Epstein, insinuated that Band-Aid, yes Band-Aid, the thing you put on when you get a little hurt, a scar, is racist because it doesn't make Band-Aids an Anderson skin tone. Here's the paragraph. I'm not making this up. This is the paragraph. It includes a quote from Anderson. This is Stephanie Epstein, some Sports Illustrated writer that I'm sure knows everything about baseball culture. And this is how, here's the quote, or here's the paragraph. Sometimes the indignities are smaller. After the Royal Series, Anderson tore up his left thumb, sliding into second in Detroit. So he dug around in the team first aid kit until he found a one inch dot the color of flesh, someone else's flesh. Quote from Anderson, that's small. We got bigger problems. End quote. But it is symbolic of his place in his sport in 2019. Anderson plays a white man's game and he plays it in a white man's Band-Aid. This man compared himself to Jackie Robison in an article where he's claiming Band-Aids are racist. And just, but they're just a small problem. But he's playing a white man's game in a white man's Band-Aid. I wouldn't call Anderson Jackie. I'd call him Band-Aid or Karen. He thinks or they think maybe he doesn't. Maybe he's got pronoun problems too. His purpose in life is to be a racism hunter. Racism and victimhood, honey, are the new path to start him. It's Star Track. Race. The final frontier. These are the voyages of the racism enterprise. It's Black Lives Matter mission to explore strange, inconsequential interactions to seek out new racism and victimhood to boldly go where no real man has gone before. No real man wants to be a victim. But the left has convinced Black men there's no higher form of Black humanity than being a damsel in distress. Instead of totally the rooster telling Anderson to calm down, act like a man, there's no crying in baseball and sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never harm me. Well, rooster baited Anderson to act like a bitch. That's the prevailing message to all men. But Black men are the lab rats of the emasculation movement where the first to surrender are stickin' balls. We're the bells of this ball. Everyone knows it. We're mocked in popular culture in Game of Thrones. Everybody was fighting for power except a group of ballless Black men called the unsullied. Tim Anderson is gray worm. He snapped because his feelings got hurt when little Joshy called him Jackie. LaRusa and members of the White Sox consoled little Timmy Anderson, clammy, Joshy was racist. Black men are perceived to be that fragile and that unstable. No one can tell us the truth and no one can criticize our behavior. In a story where he defends calling and opposing player a weak ass effing inward and insinuates that band-aid colors are racist, Tim Anderson compared himself to Jackie Robinson, the jokes right themselves. Anderson isn't is a talented baseball player with the middle capacity of an eight-year-old girl. You know why he's that weak and stupid? Because the world constructed by the left rewards him for being that weak and stupid. It has nothing to do with his skin color. Jackie Robinson had the exact same complexion. Robinson lived during an era when the world rewarded men for their intellect, emotional control, and strength. Men are being transitioned into little girls and little girls are being transitioned into grown men. Weak, old men like Tony LaRusa are too afraid to do anything about it. At age 77 with millions of dollars in the bank, LaRusa would rather collect another check grooming men for castration than take the risk of telling Anderson or any black man to man up. That's my fire. Again, it's a constant theme on this show, the emasculation of men and how black men are at the front of that line of men getting emasculated. And Tim Anderson has no idea that he's been emasculated and that his teammates that are caping up for him because they think he's weak and stupid. And they think if they don't pander to him, they think if they told him the truth like, dude, he called you Jackie, shut up and play ball. They don't think he can handle that. They got to deal with him like a little weak child, like a weak little girl. Let's throw the ball to him underhanded. Let's make sure we don't say anything that hurt it to his feelings. We don't want to hurt it his feelings. Oh my God, if he gets called Jackie, he'll fall apart. There were people talking about how courageous it was for Tim Anderson to play yesterday. And oh my God, under all that stress and pressure. And with the Yankees fans booing him and calling him Jackie, he had a home run. Oh, this is just unbelievable courage. No, it's not. It's an attention whore getting the attention he desperately wants. That's who Tim Anderson is an attention whore. Go look at all the controversies he's been involved in. He loves and seeks attention and he'll get it by any means necessary. He's no different than Jesse Smalling. Royce, let's roll out to Minneapolis, bring Royce in. Hey, man, what's going on with sports culture where getting called Jackie on the baseball field is somehow a shot below the belt. And we got we got a launching investigation by MLB. And look, I know I'm old. That's why I'm bringing you in. You're not old. You're still playing. You're an athlete. You're you're just in your early 30s, 30 31 years old. Is it out of bounds? Do we not trash talk anymore in sports? Are people that weak and fragile? This entire thing is outrageous. These are champagne problems from people who are completely detached with the real the real issues of the world. And I thought it was completely ridiculous for Anderson to reference and reference himself as Jackie Robinson in the first place. Let alone get mad for Donaldson referring to as Jackie when it was just a you know, a repeating of his own characterization. And I thought it was ridiculous for Donaldson to even qualify and apologize. And the Russo is way way out in that field. But but as petty as this is, the culture implications are huge. They're they're incredibly big. And the culture implication here is that racism is going to continue to be used as this, you know, way to categorize and clump together anything that's anti narrative, anything that's anti establishment. And they'll do it through a string of vastly different instances. You got this will be called racism. I'll be called far right. You'll be called far right. Steve Bannon is white supremacist. And they'll tie it all to the Buffalo shooter as the outcome of when white supremacy and violence goes too far. And the great scam and lie of it all is that they more black people become victims of of race violence. And the Buffalo shooter situation does seem to be an instance where where was a racially motivated attack on black people. But the establishment loves it when that happens. The establishment phones at the mouth, you can see the sparkle in their eyes when when black people are the victims of of any type of racial violence. And you know, you can tell that none of this wokeism is really an effort to empower black people or to protect black people. Because if you're watching this day and you're black and you're really worried about the violence of white supremacy breaking out in your local community, go get a concealed in carry start to shoot every day. And I realized that this officer that shot the Buffalo shooter in the chest six times but didn't take him down because he was wearing a Kevlar vest. Easy correction. If a mass shooter breaks out and you're there and you're armed, shoot for the hand. And I think if there were 10 black people in that store that day that were armed and had been trained to shoot, that shooter would have had a much more difficult time killing as many people. And even if he was able to kill as many people, I would rather have a gun and be able to defend myself than be the victim. And the establishment likes us being victims. And they'll use these champagne instances of Anderson being called Jackie to homogenize a boogeyman of white supremacy. It's ridiculous. What and you've said about for all of it true, but what drives me crazy is this whole victim that they've made the gold standard is really about being weak. I just don't, I did not grow up in any way wanting to be a victim and looking for my victimhood and just one, oh, God, a white person treated me poorly and didn't give me the ultimate amount of respect. I must share this with the world. Does Tim Anderson have any idea how weak he looks and will any teammate or maybe not a teammate because he was, is there anybody black in baseball or in sports that might tap him on the shoulder and say, Hey, man, pull your skirt down, man. This is a bad look. We can see that they've castrated you, bro. Will anybody tell him that? No, no, they won't. And again, this entire wokeism cultural undermining of America of America is by design and the weakness is by design. You got to realize if you take a step back and look at it from the 30,000 foot view, we have traded our freedom for security and materialism. I said it before, but I'll say it again. And in trading our freedom for security and materialism, we have created this virtue signaling and full outrage to deal with the reality that we realize we have no control. We've given up all control and agency and sovereignty in our everyday lives. And so these are the these are the claims, these are the claims of grievance politics and identity politics that that that are the substitute for us actually not having any real government self governance in our lives. And that, you know, part of it is is liberal white women just, you know, running a buck in the beta male sitting in the background, counting their chips, running up a running up a tab, you know, running up their bank accounts off of it. And black people playing right into it because all of our cultural leaders that preached against it, they killed them. See, I want to say this. Go ahead. Go ahead. Well, I wanted to go to your point because you've consistently made the point about the liberal white woman and the harm that she has done to black men and black culture. I think this perfectly fits in to the sports illustrated story written in 2019 written by a Stephanie Epstein white woman. I was, I'm sure a liberal and and and just like, hey, man, you got to be careful with who you give access to to frame your image. And again, this is, I know, some very talented accomplished female sports writers, but I also know that they many of them tend to write from a point of view and perspective that's not consistent with the male masculinity motif or whatever. And so this guy let some liberal white woman write a piece framing him in 2019. And that's how you get someone writing that band aids are racist. And this is a symptom of just how much oppression he faces and how isolated he is that even when he gets an owie on his arm, he can't find a black band aid. This is like, she put a clown suit on this guy. And I'm not sure he's remotely aware of it. Yeah, no, I think, I think he understands it. I think a lot of these woke athletes understand the way they're being used by the establishment and by the narrative. And it's a way for us to try and hide from taking any responsibility, right? And all of this perpetual victimhood and weakness again is as a predicate for us to give over our authority to government. That's the slow encroachment that's taking place here. You're going to be a victim of racism and white supremacy unless we the government protects you from that, unless we come in and save you, unless we are able to indoctrinate people with ideologies that are anti-godden and anti-Christian or anti-American to protect you from victimhood. And again, you got to look at a situation like Malcolm X, and I bring him up often, but this is another prime example where Malcolm X, the wire taps that were initially used to surveil Malcolm X by the FBI, were used on the grounds of him advocating to start the rifle club. And a lot of people think Malcolm X was killed because he was black and the implications of him being black, but I tend to believe that it was his advocacy of second amendment rights and his nationalism, black nationalism, and that black nationalism would eventually merge with white nationalism and that the second amendment and the independent business owner and entrepreneur are the bastion against globalism and economic imperialism. This is a deep, deep three-layered, four-layered, ten-layered game that the mainstream media has been commissioned to play with the minds of everyday American citizens. Go get a gun. It was never for the United States government to ensure your security as we as we surrendered our security to the government and to the state during the rise of our industrial stage and now even more into the radical consumer stage, these are all champagne problems. And we're all getting off by virtue signaling and having full outrage because we know we don't have any real control. We know that we're at the government's win, we're at the establishment's win, and that makes us radically anxious and depressed. And the liberal white woman is the prime example. Royce, I want you to expect, you've said something fascinating here, that you saw or see a path where black nationalism and white nationalism could merge and find some synergy and unity. Could you expound on that? Why you believe that? Well, the early iteration of the nation of Islam's suggestion around nationalism was that what was a separatist idea, right? That black people should have their own land and their own communities where they govern themselves. I think that was a bit extreme, but again, we were living in a different time racially. But I think today to say that black people in America should be nationalist in their mindset and should look and aim to see the black community as a fundamental pillar of America, the fabric of America, and that the rise of black communities, the rise of black families, the rise of black individuals is a net positive for the overall rise of America as a nation, is fundamentally and categorically true. And so Malcolm was railroaded at a time where his message may have been hard to see the trajectory of, but had black nationalism been able to play out, it would have naturally been an ally of what they say is white nationalism. Because truly, the nationalist mindset is just to say that once we create a borderless society, once we create a global governance, we lose what America's founding values are, which we can see because the left constantly tries to attack the Constitution and makes all of America's sins, a justification that or a validation that America is inherently that or evil. But as we go to globalism, we will lose what it is to be America. And that goes for black people too. And on the way, black people will continue to be victims, right, right, convenient victims to point to against the liberal neoliberal left real enemy, which is the working class, but also white Christian men. Royce, what I always heard from the nation of Islam, what a, you know, the autobiography of Malcolm X is my favorite book of all time, probably read it a half dozen times. When I was in college, I listened to a lot of fair contact. I've never hidden that. And the message that always appealed to me was self responsibility, self destiny, agency, you're in control. That's what always appealed to me. And that's why what you said brings true to me is because in my early intellectual development, the nationalist black nationalist movement appealed to me because of self responsibility. And that whole belief in self responsibility is why I've been able to build relationships in agreement with conservative white people who believe in self responsibility. I'm just looking for allies and people that believe in self responsibility. And I'm just not going to be an idiot and act like that this country hasn't been good to me, that the sacrifices generations made before me, my parents generation and generations before that, hasn't made America the ideal place for a black man to live and to achieve. And I want to partner with and be in league with whoever believes in self responsibility and whoever believes in God. And I don't care what color they are. Well, there's two there's two questions to answer at once. And we have to be able to answer them simultaneously. Is the game in the system rigged? Absolutely. Is the rigging of the system all 100% predicated on race? No, it's not. It's more predicated on classes and many leaders and black people as a group, but all working class people and all citizens as a group have to ask ourselves what is the answer for us as individuals? Is it for us to quit in a rigged game as individuals? Because it's rigged? No, we have to continue to develop ourselves and continue to work on ourselves and become the best we can be so that we can fight a system that is definitely rigged. But but mostly what the liberal establishment has has suggested or promoted is renounce America, renounce your citizenship, renounce your individuality, renounce all of your power over and will sort out, will sort out all of the fairness or unfairness for you. And the real truth behind it is they don't plan for the system to be any fair once they take over. They they plan for themselves to be in a position so strong that we'll all have to bend the knee or not be able to eat, not be able to access water, not be able to own land, not be able to own a gun, not to have any ownership. That's the communist model is that the individual has no ownership and not just your individual not your individual self, but individual in the terms of businesses, but you won't be able to own a company. You only build on a company through the state, you know, or actually the state only be able to own a company and you'll be you'll be the manager of a company that stayed on that's communist China. Okay, so you know Malcolm was brilliant when he said the price of freedom is death. And I think that's something black people have to really take to heart the price of freedom is death. And he doesn't mean that becoming free happens once you die means that you have to wrestle with and accept that death is a possibility that comes with freedom. Okay, and what's what's interesting about that Malcolm X quote, which is infamous one of his infamous quotes is that it was originally said by Thomas Jefferson, right? So for all of the all of the criticism around America's founding fathers and the inception and the constitution and the racism and the slavery, Malcolm X is one of Malcolm X's most profound quotes comes from Thomas Jefferson. Malcolm X Thomas Jefferson, they don't think much different than me. Royce, thank you so much. Appreciate it. People had no idea that the Tim Anderson, Josh Donaldson, or Kerfuffle had this many legs to it and the conversation could be expanded as broadly as we just did there. But it but it did this whole. Emasculation of men in general black men in particular. It speaks to a larger issue going on in American society and what the left is doing and and how they have convinced us that there's no higher form of humanity than being a victim. And so we look for it everywhere. Tim Anderson's looking for it in band-aid packages. My God, if he can find it in band-aid, he can find it anywhere. All right, let's take care of some business.

Welcome back. Time to roll out to Los Angeles and bring in our main man Steve Kim, the Korean co-sell Steve. Welcome back to the show. I had to talk to you about this Tim Anderson, Josh Donaldson, Tony LaRouza, White Sox Yankees. Oh my god, Tim Anderson, he was called Jackie and that was racist and I've never seen a more overblown thing than this but it really doesn't surprise me because Tony LaRouza is a 77 year old geyser stealing a million bucks or a million and a half dollars from the Chicago White Sox just trying to wrap up his career and the last thing he wants to be accused of is being racist so he threw gas on this whole deal with Tim Anderson but I can't wait to hear the Korean co-sell. Literally I'm calling you the Korean co-sell. That's probably racist if we asked Tony LaRouza and Tim Anderson. Yeah, the Chicago woke sauce. That's what they are nowadays and I don't know what is more insulting. What Josh Donaldson said in Riving Anderson or Anderson actually comparing himself to Jackie Robinson at all the irony of saying that your Jackie Robinson knowing what he went through as he came into the major leagues in 1947 to break the color line and to paint Josh Donaldson as this modern day Ennis country slaughter who was one of many players who openly rebelled and taunted Robinson. It just goes to show you that there are different sets of rules. The one mistake Donaldson made I think two of them. Number one is not realizing there's a different set of rules now. You're not allowed to rib Anderson and then he basically somehow him and Aaron Boone are trying to softly apologize which they shouldn't at all but I guess they're forced to but the bottom line is this Tim Anderson is a shortstop and he should be treated with kid gloves. Don't say anything to him. Don't kid around with them. No locker room humor. But don't even look his way. Just ignore him. Save yourself the hassle. Here's the other question that I want to ask you Jason as someone that was on the beat me and you have had to interview athletes before we've been on the scene in locker rooms and post game situations where it gets heated. Today's media at large the corporate legacy media is so gutless. I'd be willing to bet that many of these journalists if you want to call them that probably don't have any harsh feelings towards Donaldson. They don't think it's offensive but because everyone now was under pressure not to just be you know not racist you have to be virantly anti-racist. In mass they all jumped on Donaldson and not one of them basically except us two more fearless. Had the guts to say this is a non-story Anderson needs to move on and toughen up. Steve what's offensive to me is and again you're mostly in the boxing environment and the things that get said inside of a gym are pretty profane pretty cruel no no one's feelings are spared. For me as someone coming from the sports world being an athlete being in locker room environment this is so mundane so tame so this is the good nature ribbing that has always been a part of sports and and again I could go back we're feminizing sports to the level where you can't even joke with people and again I don't think he was trying to be Tim Anderson's best friend. He was trying to get inside his head and poke him and that when I think about Larry Bird and Magic Johnson and that era Michael Jordan and the trash talking that went on on the court and was commonplace and was celebrated in sports that we've now moved to a place where you can't call a guy who called himself Jackie Robinson you can't call him Jackie what are we doing the sports? You said it yourself we are softening it but there are two sets of rules speaking of Larry Bird he one time said if I ever saw a team put a white guy on me I take it as an insult I don't even know if he'd be able to say that nowadays that'd be a big thing but you know here's the thing that gets me about Anderson Jackie Robinson had to go through so many things and then Larry Gobi after him for the American League what you go through right now Tim is nothing it's actually an insult you need to stop using that analogy because you're if that actually got you upset then you're soft and consider yourself very lucky that you play in this era where you are now treated with kid gloves as I said and handled like a Faber J. Egg as for Tony LaRusa he's in a very difficult spot but I don't have a lot of sympathy for him because you think you would be at that age in a status and a place in life where I can at least be honest and say look things got out of hand nowadays we're more sensitive but for him to flat out say that there was a racist comment said and then that's all I'm going to say about it I wish one of the writers would have said well wait a minute he himself if they would have known the contest there has to be someone with enough guts to ask LaRusa well if a guy calls himself Jackie Robinson do other players not have the right to derisively use that against them in the field of play but I believe many of these journalists and writers are simply afraid to say it because in that corporate media spear they are not even allowed to defend Josh Donaldson even if they really believe in the deepest recesses of their mind that he did nothing wrong. I'm trying to figure out and not figure out but like if if Tim Anderson and the White Sox because some of uh uh Tim Anderson's teammates rallied around him and said yeah he knew Josh Donaldson knew what he was doing he was wrong but and I'm like are we that fragile are black athletes and this generation of 40 and below black are we seen as that fragile that we have to be handled with kid gloves to this level that I hope that that's not the case but that does seem like where we're headed. Well look that's the new standard that's been set by everybody um as relates to his teammates and situations like this what I have noticed Jason is that this then becomes the uh oppression Olympics and you're almost bound to defend the teammate especially if he's a minority and because you want to get points you want to get social justice points you want to have that equity and then you want to be invited to the cookout and then you want to be known as an ally and it's ridiculous a lot of this is about show and tell like see I defended the guy I I got his back and I'm down with the cause there's I just don't think there's a lot of sincerity in this and I kind of feel bad for Josh Donaldson but I hope he realizes the minute you capitulate and you give in and you apologize that is a slippery slope where you start to go down the abyss I I would have and again this is not realistic but if I'm Josh Donaldson I would have said I said what I said you people don't have to like it but I am not taking it back I am not sorry unfortunately the issue then becomes the organization themselves they may have actually forced Josh Donaldson into an apology that much I do understand. Well hats off to New York Yankees fans who booed Tim Anderson and caught Channet Jackie at him hats off for them for not backing down you know at least somebody's got a pair still swinging between their legs and some and some women with some balls as well I want to I want to move on to my favorite athlete of all time you know what is Tiger like 25 30 40 tie does that make him your Asian brother from another I'm sure you're some sort of Tiger Woods fan he withdrew from the PGA championship this weekend after a third round 79 I watched every stroke of that I'm a Tiger Woods nut I got on my ESPN plus and and watch that disaster and and here was the conclusion I came to Steve either and you helped me decide either Nike is afraid of Tiger going and playing in the state farm Buick open Honda Classic championship and not making the cut and so that's why he's only competing in majors at this point because like oh it's heroic he made the cut of a major or if he misses the cut in a major it's not as embarrassing as missing the cut at the Buick open or one of these mundane regular golf tournaments but if Tiger ever wants to return to form any type of championship caliber form he's going to have to go out and grind it out on the regular tour and get back into playing form he can't just do it by cherry picking the majors if he does he's going to do with what we've seen in the last two majors he'll have a couple of decent Thursdays and Fridays and then look like you know a guy that's just not in shape mentally or physically for the third and fourth round of these major tournaments he's got to get out here and grind if he wants to get back to any type of championship form well first of all I am not a fan of Tiger Woods I'm that rare Asian I'm a good driver bad at math and I hate golf sorry the Campbell nation has never done it for me I've always believed that his impact on the world has been overblown I've never understood it I don't even think look I'm not saying he's not an athlete but the average ordinary four round prize fighter is a better athlete than any golfer okay bottom line and I will die on that hill 50 different times now as it relates to Tiger Woods what is he right now I've used this analogy before in boxing one of my favorite movies the blues brothers remember at the end when they had that great concert to save the the nun in her church and they said okay we have a hundred miles to go we got a full tank of gas and we're wearing sunglasses and it's dark outside so they have to get to the the city assessor's office to drop off the check and finally the blues brothers J. K. L. where they pull up and all of a sudden they get to the car just blows up remember that black car that's Tiger's body that's Tiger's J. I completely disagree with you he's at that point like that classic car you can only drive him once a week on Sundays maybe on Whittier Boulevard for the car show driving nice and slow don't take him out on that road trip he's not meant to drive in traffic every single day he's not but in my view now didn't Tiger win a major's about four five years ago was a great Cinderella story 2018 or so a couple years ago he won the Masters just a few of the Masters okay that should have been if he's Muhammad Ali which he isn't but if you're gonna make that analogy that should have been his Muhammad Ali beating Leon Spinks in the rematch moment in 1978 it was very obvious that after the rumbled in the jungle the thriller in Manila Muhammad Ali was at the very tail end he got beat by Leon Spinks in his seventh or eighth pro fight then they have the rematch five six months later at the Superdome and he wins that fight to become the first three time heavyweight champion of the world or something and it was a great momentous occasion he should have walked away then because after that from Muhammad Ali was an ill-fated fight against Larry Holmes and then Trevor Burbank which was utterly forgettable Tiger should have walked away then bottom line look go to the seniors tour that's what he should be doing but for Tiger Woods who at one time was on par pun fully intended with Jack Nicklaus this is now sad i'm not even a tiger fan and i feel bad for him but but i'm just telling you Jason he's not he does not have enough in the gas tank to play regularly he just doesn't his body is completely broken down okay i'm not even gonna debate you i disagree with you but i'm not gonna debate you on that because look you win the Masters and the Tigers just 46 you still go out and compete and play you just won the Masters head you if you doesn't have that second car accident you know maybe he wins this year's Master because of gusta sets up well for him and he knows the course really well you don't walk away and retire after winning the Masters particularly before this last accident but here's the question i want you to ask yourself because what you're saying may be true but we'll never know if all he does is go out and cherry pick major tournaments to play in and so what do you think is driving his decision at the moment to only play in majors is it Nike telling him to avoid playing in these regular tournaments and the embarrassment of missing the cut or is it Tiger's own ego that couldn't handle getting not making the cut or or finishing i think he was like when he stepped when he withdrew uh Saturday i think he was in 76 place is it Tiger's ego or is it Nike's advice keeping him out of these regular tournaments it could be a bit of both but i'm going to use another boxing analogy which athlete kills me since we're talking about Tiger Woods a golfer but when most boxers start off as four and six round fighters they're very very active they fight very often and they become eight round fighters and ten round fighters and they eventually fight for a championship but they're generally very active within the first i would say seven to ten years of a career if it actually lasts that long then if you become an icon like a mani pack yeah a Floyd Mayweather an Oscar de la hoya when you reach that multi-million dollar level and your pay reviews are the biggest events in the sports these guys activities uh activity overall wanes a lot for instance Marvin Hagler at almost 70 fights his last three years uh 85 86 87 you only fought one time each there comes a point timer i believe that Tiger who's given so much to the sport he's done it his whole life i think mentally he might be more fatigued than his body is broken down physically in other words a guy like him can get up for the us open the British open and the masters and i guess whatever that other majors is so if you allow him to prepare three to four months like a lot of fighters do with the training camp to get in there once or twice a year they're up for it but if you're going to ask them to play eight to ten to twelve tournaments a year Jason trust me there will be a lot of tournaments that right around the 53rd hole he's just going to wave the white flag and say now i'm good i'm good i actually think and again i'm gonna defend tiger here at this stage of his life and his career because i know what he means to the television ratings of the pga they should be thankful that he's even doing this at this moment Steve you're not a golf fan i'm not right yeah he yeah he's tied with Sam Snead at 82 victories on the pga tour him getting to 83 that's the consolation prize for not getting to 18 jack's number of total major victories and so if he can get to 83 and stand alone ahead of Sam Snead it's an incredible accomplishment that i'm sure he has in the back of his mind but i think fear right now is motivating him to stay away from that again because i sat and watched all of that i listened to broadcasters Thursday and Friday talk oh this is so heroic tiger grinded it out on the back nine and shot a 69 and made the cut you know but by a stroke and bob a this is so they could spin it all everything he did Thursday and Friday even though for him it was basically average rounds of golf they could spin it as heroic in a story you can't do that at the Buick open or you know the the waffle house invitational you can't do it but he's got a history then with waffle house huh yeah i didn't think about that but i'm telling 83 is important to him he's got to get the courage to go out there and take the risk and make and risk risking the cut at some non-descript tournament this little thing of cherry picking majors blowing up in his face hey i want to switch to one other topic outside of sports i don't know if you caught this and i think we have a little clip here bill marr continues to be on a wok busting rampage on his hbo show man he went off on the transgender movement uh this friday and you know we've seen him go against the wolf mob on a bunch of different issues but to basically hop into dave shapelle's frying pan and go after that i don't think people saw that coming from bill marr here i think we got a little clip here a taste of it broken down over time the lgbt population of america seems to be roughly doubling every generation according to a recent gallop poll less than one percent of americans born before 1946 that's joe biden's generation identify that way 2.6 percent of boomers do 4.2 percent of gen x 10.5 percent of millennials and 20.8 percent of gen z which means if we follow this trajectory we will all be gay in 2050s gender fluid kids are fluid about everything if kids knew what they wanted to be at age eight the world will be filled with cowboys and princesses i wanted to be a pirate thank god nobody took me seriously and scheduled me for i removal and i'm i've been tracking bill marr getting red pill for a solid year year and a half maybe two years i've always liked bill marr because i thought he was honest i thought he was smart and i've been saying ever since trump got out of office now that he doesn't have trump to talk about he's going to have to deal with the truth and once he starts dealing with the truth he's going to figure out how bs the woke is uh your thoughts on the red pill in a bill mar all i could say is after those clips in this past weekend show if he does a concert at the hollywood bowl i would get extra security if i'm bill mar um but you're right though you know there was a point where i watched that show weekly for years and then it came a point probably halfway through the trump administration where i said okay i can't take it i thought bill lost his way now looks like he's getting back onto the plantation and i think there's another factory here i believe he lives in california anyone that has a shred of honesty and intelligence or a mixture of both can't see what is going on in our state just driving around the city looking at the crime reports watching any type of news that has any integrity and think what is taking place in our city is acceptable over the long term and but this is where people will rip bill mar they only get honest or get outraged when it affects them directly and i think that's one of the issues people have with the elite that when you're on the ivory tower on top looking down at us peasants you don't care you want us to eat cake as soon as it affects you now all of a sudden you become honest and a speaker of truth but i will give bill marcreta given the fact that the circles that he runs in uh i would bet because i think i've gone through this you've probably gone through this when you make your beliefs on this side of the fence and i guess you want to call it right so clear and with the platform that he has he's probably lost friends and for him to do this so consistently the past 12 to 18 months of you said i'll give a tip of the cap he does deserve some credit well he deserves some credit but i also think he's a businessman that has his finger in the air uh they can see that the independent route is the way to go moving forward and so he started this uh podcast network of his own club random i think he calls it and i think he sees that as the future he wants the same independence joe rogan has adam korola adam korola was on his show this past weekend and so i think he's building his path towards independence and away from the corporate purse strings of an hbo and any other network and you know i i think this is he signed a two-year i think extension and i think this is it he hopes that his podcast takes off and did not just see konayno brian just got a deal for his podcast here for 150 million bucks bill marwins some of that type money uh let's keep it moving i think it's time and let's uh wrap up the show because i think it's time for my favorite segment the approval rating all right thank you for uh joining me for this approval rating uh steve i will let's see how low you can go tony larusa is our topic uh as we talked about throughout the show was way swine and with you as well tony larusa a guy that i'm calling a baby groomer uh his groom his grooming men into being beta males uh so uh job performance i think the white socks i think they they swept that double header now they're one game above 500 uh this year so uh you know tony larusa's had a lot of success over the years uh once in world series very well respected i'm gonna give him a 15 in job performance uh as a manager the chicago white socks yeah i looked up their record they're 21 and 20 now and they're not out of anything this thing is a marathon i gave him a 10 though um that's just that whole thing just kind of bothers me now if you want to go overall job performance which we're not doing you could buy a go higher but right there he gets the bow darik uh character is our next uh i'm calling him a groomer so i don't know how i could be too high in character and so i'm not i give him a 10 i'll go bow darik in terms of character i think his behavior this weekend uh low character tony larusa a 10 in character oh he's a character now he's he's a captain sjw and i gave him a five no respect for that no respect he knows what he's doing um he's he's appeasing the mob he is playing to the crowd i think the word is called pandering and that's what he's doing a five uh authenticity i think he's completely in authentic guys best friends with bill parcells and bobbie knight and now he's a he's a woke social justice warrior are you kidding me now he's you know captain of playing the race card i don't find it authentic at all this guy's been in baseball since professional baseball majorly since 1963 and and someone getting called jackie is racism in this uh shot below the belt give me a give me a break guys completely inauthentic i give him a five you know i'd like to say bill parcells or uh robert mongummering i are still friends with them i i would bet that those two guys were probably rolling their eyes shaking their head and i i don't know if i was those two i would take him off the test chain i gave him a three i'm sorry there's nothing authentic about what tony larusa did this past weekend i would love to see bobbie knight's texturing uh and who he's in a texturing with and if he knows how to text uh it factor uh let the guys had a lot of success he's been involved in baseball 59 years i give him a 16 in it factor you know at this war i actually did factor in his whole career and i still remember as a kid he was the manager of the chicago white socks in the early 80s actually won the al west and then he had i would think a dominant run even though they only won one world series with the oakland athletics he was ahead of his time in terms of the bull pen usage and platooning and all that stuff and i think you want a title or two with st. l christ look when you hire a tony larusa even at this age that means you have a shot that that's a serious manager with hall of fame credentials so with that i have to give him credit i gave him a 20 all right uh you got him at 38 a dumpster fire i have him just barely candlelit at a 46 steve thank you uh so much uh a great start to our week here on monday korean kosselma let you go and i'm going to let you guys go because i hear tomorrow and that means we'll see you tomorrow freedom i won't feed them no no go she has she my system or relation we just want to have freedom sitting on a corner never been on a wrecking my back for freedom bless we are living get back we are receiving all the seed when we are on a beat for you we're on freedom i just want i wanna be i just want i wanna be i just want i wanna be i just want a i want to be i just want"
