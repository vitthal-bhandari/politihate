    "text": " I don't think that generally I've seen a lot of resistance at the Supreme Court level to the way that this Jeff Sessions and Bill Barr Justice Department have been sort of careening through history trying to break stuff. Hello and welcome to Why is this happening with me, your host Chris Hayes. I just got a chance to see an amazing documentary. I'm hoping we have the directors on at some point. It's called The Fight and it's about the first several years of Trump administration and the ACLU and it's a dear friend of mine, Elise Steinberg is one of the filmmakers. She also was one of the filmmakers on Wiener and the film follows a bunch of ACLU lawyers through the first two years of Trump administration, including early footage of legal art, was their immigration attorney and who's been on this podcast coming out of the Brooklyn courthouse to get an injunction on the Muslim ban. That first weekend was instituted and in the background of the shot is your humble podcaster, Chris Hayes, who had gone there to report on it and I'm actually calling into MSNBC at that moment. And it's a really great movie. And you know, the conceit of the work that they do in the ACLU and Chase Strandjoe is another figure in it who's been on this podcast is that the courts mean something in America and one means of preserving rights for people is struggle through the courts. And I think there's been a lot to credit that view in the Trump years. Been a lot of things the Trump administration has tried to do that the courts have been like, no, can't do this. This doesn't pass muster. But something worrying has been happening as time has gone on, which is that the further up the chain they've gotten, the more license they've been granted by the courts, including the Supreme Court, which has given them a whole lot of green lights to do a whole lot of terrible stuff. And not only that, the courts are not a static entity. They are a group of judges who are constantly being replaced by the most ambitious pipeline of judicial confirmation, basically in the nation's history. They smash all kinds of records in terms of the amount of judges they've put on district courts and in appellate courts, they obviously already have two Supreme Court justices that have sort of definitively kind of flipped the balance of the court or at least cemented if five for conservative majority. If Donald Trump is reelected, they will lock down the federal judiciary for the next 20 years. The Supreme Court, the appellate courts, it's all basically gone. And there is so much horrible wrong that a court can do. I think that there's something that happened to liberals, which is that because of the rights revolution that happens in the Warren court, because of decisions like Brown v. Board and Roe v. Wade, I think liberals generally have come to see the courts as favorable as allies in a fight for progress as protectors of minority rights. But that has not been what the federal courts have been throughout history. The federal courts have been largely a bastion of reaction through most of federal history. I don't think it's an overstatement to say that. I mean, Plessy versus Ferguson is a good example. Korematsu is another. There are tons. So now we're at a point where like this fundamental question of what the courts are, like are the courts just another political player? Are they just another political entity in the Hobbesian struggle for power that is America in the 21st century and this polarized Alexa it? Are they something more elevated? Do we lose something if we see them as these kind of political actors? Are we losing the thing that makes them special? Are we doing what Donald Trump does when he calls it an Obama judge? Or are we being realistic about the actual like political machinations that produce the court and the court as a political player? All these questions weigh very heavily on my mind. And I wanted to talk about them with someone I've known forever and admired forever. The great writer and podcaster, Dalia Lithwick, she's senior legal correspondent for Slate. She's hosted Slate podcast Amicus. As you will see in this conversation, I've known Dalia for a long time. She knows my wife very well. We end up talking about Kate for like half the podcast. And Dalia is so fascinating because I think if you've listened to the podcast I've done with Kate, we've done two of them, you know, and I talk about Kate a lot on the podcast because obviously she's probably more influential than any other single person. But you know, Kate really is very clear-eyed about the law but has a real genuine faith in it that I find like inspiring and invigorating. And Dalia I think has like reached a little bit more of a crisis of faith, like a little more broken about her faith in the courts and the law. And so she's an interesting voice to be in dialogue with around these questions because like as we go through this election, I just cannot stress enough that like when you want to come down to like what is the clearest thing, the difference between Donald Trump or her runs against Donald Trump is that the Supreme Court will be gone for a very long time. And it feels remote or abstract to talk about that but that means Roe is probably gone. It means a lot of the basic fundamental civil rights and voting rights protections we have are probably gone. The modern administrative state is probably gone in its current form. I mean, really that sounds alarmist but I honestly think like that's what's on the agenda. And so this is an extremely important moment to have this conversation. I've known you for a long time. I've been a fan of yours forever. You're my second favorite legal writer in the world. To be clear, I demanded that introduction. I wanted the Kate Shaw minus the wife of wife of mine and mother of my children. Don't say you're the mother of my children because that would be weird as hell. No, I mean, Kate Knight's funny. Kate and I, even when she was in law school, we would like read your columns on the court and like talk about them and trade them back and forth and be like, did you see this dialy line? Did you see what she said? So I'm a huge admire of yours. And there's a lot to talk about. I guess I want to start on impeachment. Kate actually wrote this op-ed in the Times about how much it mattered. I thought it was just a really insightful piece about how much it mattered, what kinds of arguments they made. And if you assume acquittal is essentially for ordained and to be clear, it's removals never happen in the history of the country. So it's not like some like crazy cork right now. It's a very high threshold. She said it matters if they're making essentially legal arguments or if they're making sort of like crass political ones and what kind of arguments they're making. And then you had a piece in slate being like, the arguments they're making are dangerous or like genuinely dangerous to the country. Why do you find them so dangerous? Well, I mean, I guess we should be clear that we're taping shortly after Alan Dershowitz said his, I think, I think the legal term is bad shit. I don't know if I'm allowed to swear, but I mean, that really stood in the well of the Senate and said it can't be a corrupt motive. It can't be an impeachable offense if the president did the thing he did because he just really wanted to get reelected because that's for the good of the nation. He views his reelection in the national interest. And again, to be clear, he seems to have sort of walked that back and now is demanding Lincoln Douglas style debates with every journalist who has misinterpreted accurately characterized his argument. The words he said with his mouth. But okay. But so, you know, in a little bit that article was in reaction to, I think there are just two things that he did that I found very scary. One was and many, many people called this out. And when it happened was you just can't say that as long as there's mixed motives, as long as 99% of this was a corrupt motive, when 1% was for the good of America, then he can't be impeached because it really does open the floodgates for presidents to suppress the vote and have people assassinated and launch foreign wars. I mean, there's, you know, anything is off the table. And obviously that's very scary. The other thing that he did in this, I actually remember talking to Kate about back when she was writing about presidential tweets and motive. Because the other thing that Dershowitz did that I find very destabilizing, Chris, is he took Mince Raya out of the picture, right? Intent is no longer something that is subject to scrutiny. And you may remember, you know, some of the times that I talked to Kate for my show were when we were talking about whether the tweets, whether the statements that the president made before the travel ban, whether his antipathy toward Muslims on the campaign trail, whether any of that mattered in establishing a sort of anti-Muslim animus for purposes of the travel ban. And the argument that his lawyers were making even then, two years ago in court, were very familiar to what Dershowitz is doing, which is it is not ours to probe the mind of the way. Who are we to psychologize and try to understand the deep, ineffable complexity of Donald Trump, right? Who is like basically lizard brain. The least complex, yes. And so I'm worried about those two things acting in tandem because first he's saying there can be no corrupt motive if he's just trying to get reelected. And then going further and saying, but really, who are we in this jury to even ask what the president's motives were? And I just really, really worry that that is kind of the phrase I use with sort of constitutionalizing narcissism. But we're all trapped in Donald Trump's brain. We're careening back and forth in his world of like, I want this, I don't want this, I like this, this makes me grumpy. And the idea that all of that cannot be subject to a check because we can't ask ourselves what his motives are, what his mens rea is. I find very scary. It's scary and it's crazy making too. And I think the Muslim ban example and Kate wrote this great law review article about, the presidential speech, precisely in this question about, you know, using it as evidence of intent. Like I remember someone, it was some law professor who said something like, look, if you're running a municipality and you pass a law that says you have to put your garbage out on Saturdays or face a fine, like that's obviously fine. If you do it because there's been a big influx of Orthodox Jews into your municipality and you want to send the message to them, we don't want you here. And we're going to start racking up fines on you because you're observing the Sabbath and won't put your garbage out. That's obviously not fine. But the thing that makes it not fine is the intent of the thing. There's just no way around it. So if you say, well, who's to say intent, then you're just opening up this crazy floodgates for all sorts of like persecution and oppression and misuse of government authority. And what's so funny is for the past two weeks, I've been saying, why are we even listening to Alan Dershowitz? He's not a constitutional law scholar. He's a criminal law scholar. But that makes this even more annoying because the predicate for white-collar crime for so much of criminal law is understanding that mens rea, that your mental intent is one of the elements. Like you can't just say, and for the crime of the thing that I say has to be criminal, there can be no mens rea or at least the president somehow floats above the mental state. We can't even ask ourselves because that is wrong. I just think it's really crazy coming from a criminal lawyer because if you can't ask yourself, did this person want to be part of this corrupt conspiracy or not, you can never prove conspiracy. It's nuts. And so it's particularly galling coming from him. And it's more than that too, right? Because it's, you know, there's the problem of all this proving too much. You know, if the president were, say, not this president, but say, let's say a president had a crazed fan assassinate his rival who was serving the Senate on the steps of US Capitol. Well, that went dark and that president, well, I'm in a dark place right now. And that president were to the next, you know, the person's arrested by the Capitol Hill police is putting jail under the federal system, right? Because he's in on Capitol Hill and the president issues a part in the next day. Now, clearly the pardon powers within is absolute in the Constitution. If you're going to come to me and say, that's not impeachable. Yeah. Yeah. Well, then we've got a real problem. Like them, you know, what are we doing? And it seems to me the logical entailments of all the arguments are making is that that wouldn't be impeachable. And maybe this goes to, I mean, I think the reason that you and I are sitting in a studio and our eyes are googling around in our head is because we're about to see the majority of Republicans in the Senate all sign off on this. And I think that the thing that happened this week that is also kind of crazy making is we went from John Bolton has to testify. There is new evidence. There is no question. This is the one person that we didn't have, right? The center of the, of the donut, which was the guy who was in the room and knows what was said. And that guy's going to be allowed to testify. And somehow the way we've made ourselves okay with, we don't need new evidence is in this just span of a couple short days, we've moved to this really terrifying place of, we don't need new evidence. We know what Bolton's going to say. Let's stipulate. He's probably going to say the tunnel truck was part of this completely corrupt conspiracy that was only done to serve his own interests. And that's fine. And there's been a lot of good writing by people who are sort of watching the degradation of the rule of law, the idea that we went from it didn't happen, it happened, but it doesn't matter. That's just a really profound shift. The sentence I used, trying to, trying to describe this to someone is, they always say, if you can't win on the facts, argue the law here, they can't change the facts. So, oh my God, they're going to change the law. They're changing the notion of what intent is they are changing the notion of what an impeachable offenses, they are now going to say a president cannot be impeached as long as he says he was serving the national interest by corruptly promoting his electoral fortunes. Like they're changing the law. And the really, and the upsetting thing about this to me is that it gets at this sort of fundamental question about what we mean when we say the rule of law, because I think there's some sort of aspirational aspect to that. And there's also a live reality. I mean, when you interview people who live in places in which the rule of law really doesn't function, Egypt under Hosni Mubarak, thinking of this because I remember having a long conversation once with the Egyptian dissident about Tahrir, you know, there really is a difference between that system and ours. But the worry here, right, is that the aspirational idea of the rule of law is that it's a restraint, it's a binding restraint on power. The worst use of law is essentially a weapon for powerful to wield. And those two things are true simultaneously in America, sit side by side. Donald Trump has spent 40 years using the laws of weapon. I mean, literally guys who like installed his pianos in the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City who didn't get paid and then they sued him and then he just ran out the clock in court and then he countersued. And he's doing that now to the whole country, the constitution. I mean, you had his lawyers up being like, well, if you call one witness, there's going to be a million and then it's going to get tied up the courts. We're going to make a mistake. Gum up the Senate. It's working so hard to do nothing. And that part of it, like we've seen it with Harvey Weinstein, we've seen a lot of the MeToo stuff where it's like, you're armed with lawyers, you're armed with NDAs, you're armed with these very powerful people that know how to like work the courts, sucked that they turn the courts, they turn the law into a tool of shutting you up or to keeping you in your place. And that to me always exists. So I don't want to be like, you know, overly sort of optimistic about what the rule of law in America means, but it just seems like this is taking it to a new level. You went super dark. So I'm going there too. And I will say like one of the things that I've been reading compulsively in the last two years at the suggestion, by the way, of a judge who said, you should read this, is the Nuremberg judges trials because you really realize what happens when you have a form, right? An institution of formal structure of judges judging and using their power for really evil ends. And it's just a useful corrective for me because I have been such a like Patty Hearst fan girl of the courts, you know, my entire career, the courts are good and they're just and you know, they were a little off in the south if you were, you know, an African American defendant and an all-white jury stipulated. But you know, by and large, this is a machine that brings about justice. And it's really helpful to go back and see what judges, quad judges acting, you know, under the color of law were doing. And so I just want to make sure I understand this. You're saying the records of the Nuremberg trials against Nazi judges who sat in the Nazi legal system and issued rulings under the law of Germany. And they were perfectly like within the four corners of, you know, and then when they go on trial, they're just like, I mean, I was just applying the law. And for me, it's useful. You know, all the Nuremberg stuff is useful, but it's just really useful to be in my lane looking at what judges, how they justify what they did. And I think if you were even, you know what, until you said that, I did not know that judges were prosecuting Nuremberg. Yeah, no, it's quite amazing. And it's a really good reminder because if you were black in the south in the 1930s, that's what your life was like. Yeah. And you have no illusions that, you know, the kinds of illusions I bring to the table. And I say it all, A, to just depress us further. But also, I think to make this point that if you read, I mean, the best book on this is James Ziren's book about the law of Trump and then like 1400 lawsuits that he has done exactly what you're describing, just using the law to crush and destroy people who complain about him, to get what he wants, to get himself out of any kind of, you know, creditor situation that he doesn't like. I mean, it's just, this is a pattern. He's been doing it his whole life. This is a broycon special. And he has just all of those plays are in evidence in his defense. You know, you trash the other side, you belittle and besmirch their motives. I cannot believe we're talking about Hunter Biden day after day on the, you know, in the well of the Senate. And it's just all of these techniques that have to do with running out the clock, making sure that whatever judicial process might, you know, avail justice is just not going to work in a timely way. And this has been his whole life. We just didn't expect the courts to exceed to it. Well, that's, I mean, that really is, to me, the question you just talked about being kind of, you know, a believer in this sort of aspirational vision of the rule law. And Kate, who we've now mentioned a bunch is that and I draw tremendous like inspiration from her belief because it's, it's, it's not naive in any way. It's very complicated and profound. Like she is really thought about this and really does believe in it truly and deeply in a way that I find inspiring and like draw personal kind of like solace and inspiration from, but it also feels like we're at a test case of it in some ways. And you wrote this piece that was about Kavanaugh that really stuck with me about why you hadn't been to the Supreme Court since Kavanaugh was put on the court, which was kind of a creed, a core of a kind of something in you breaking about your faith in this, this institution that you've devoted a lot of your adult life to writing about. So a couple of things. I mean, one thing is I'm not sure I've like had a public conversation about it. So it's, it's, it's arresting to, to, to think about it a little bit. I, I, I class myself with K, with my law school colleagues, with the people that I cover on the courts as one of these really small sea conservative liberals, like because we just believe in institutions and no one feels weirder when courts are under attack than I do because from day one of Trump and Trumpism, I was the one who said two things are going to save us, journalism and the courts. And I really believe that. And I've had to reckon with the fact, I mean, we can talk about this till the cast come home, but you know, Donald Trump has ceded a fifth of the federal appeals courts, maybe closer to a quarter at this point. If he has four more years, half of the federal appeals courts will be Trump appointees and they're young and the ABA says they're activists and not qualified and they're already week after week issuing rulings that are anathema in all sorts of places that you and I care about. And so then I, I have felt for some time, like I was weirdly in this foot race, right? Because I want to believe in the courts. I need to believe in the courts. It is still statistically true that Donald Trump has lost like 70% of the court. You should be clear on that. Like he really has gotten his ass handed to him a ton in federal courts is the losing his president in modern history, right? And it's largely because, you know, everything is done sloppy and they can't seem to comply. It was just like the basic, you know, how you do procedures in order to change laws. So he loses all the time, even with a massive shift in the federal bench, but that's going to end. And I feel like a lot of people are looking for the marker of at what point, you know, he's flipped two circuits. I think about to flip three circuits at what point are the markers, the indicia of, oh, now the courts are not going to be the bulwark against Trumpism. They are going to be actually the handmaids of Trumpism. And are we going to know when that happens? And so I've been kind of feeling like I was patrolling that border as a journalist and as a court lover for a long time. And I think Kavanaugh really accelerated that for me because I just was in the room during his Senate hearing. I was, you know, not far from Dr. Ford. I was not far from him. I think I described in that piece what it was like when he started shouting. And my kid who was watching in school in New York, like texted me and was like, are you perfectly safe in there? Because I think this guy is dangerous. And how that kind of blanked me for a minute as a parent, like my kid thinks that I am in physical peril because Brett Kavanaugh is like spit screaming. All of that was really disarming. And in addition to which the part of me that believes that Justice Cures things knew that that FBI investigation was bogus, that Debbie Ramirez was never even interviewed or, you know, so I think that the process was so broken. And then I just had to sit with the fact that am I going to go and sit in the court with my notepad and my pen and write Justice Kavanaugh asked a witty question about X, Y, or Z or as you said, is something just irreparably damaged in my view. And then it goes to this thing that I've really struggled with, Chris, which is at what point are you complicit, right? At what point are you covering for and normalizing something that you just think in your bones is wrong? And I think that that has been, I'm sure you have a million versions of this where I'm asked to be on stages with people that I think. Well, I work in cable news. I'm totally pure and never out of view. Exactly. It's really hard. And it's, I mean, not a day goes by where I don't have somebody pick up the phone and say like, should I be like on a panel with, you know, person X, Ken Starr, somebody called this summer and said, I just don't know if I need to be on a panel with Ken Starr. So I think that there is a really deeply personal set of questions here about how you find your line about giving cover to something you think is broken. And I, that was my answer for me. And maybe I would just add parenthetically that the worst possible outcome of that particular piece, which I wrote this fall, was the number of constitutional law professors and people who teach Supreme Court seminars in law school who wrote me notes saying, thank you for giving voice to that. That's why I gave up teaching constitutional law this year. And I wanted to like really have my ears out. I don't want them to quit. Like we can't all say, well, the court's not a court and the law is not the law and I'm not teaching it anymore. That's got to be wrong. So if I gave cover to those people to do what I'm doing, then I am full of regrets. And I think that it gets there is really there's a very deeply personal thing, I think as people wrestle with this period, and particularly I think people that are institutionalists, people that have worked in clerked and federal appeals clerks as you have have worked in administrations have been in situations in which they're making very difficult calls about what the right thing to do, what the legal thing to do is, which is that admiration, respect for what, how valuable that is, a system that has those things while watching it be kind of gutted. And also being a little like I find myself a little tempted, like I think, okay, well, if there's a Democratic president in 2021, they just need like a bunch of people, they need to do the same thing. Just like plow ahead with your climate agenda, throw a million things at the courts, some of them are going to get struck down, but some of them you might win or you might delay enough to get it done. If you got to like, if you got to break some eggs, making the omelet, like don't be overly worried about the lawyers, what the lawyers say. And I feel that temptation right now, which seems to me like obviously natural and almost crazy not to do that, but also like dangerous. Right. Right. You pack the courts on the first day, you add a cophillion new seats to the federal circuit courts, voting in DC and Puerto Rico, you could fix this. And I feel the same way as you, which is the small C conservative in me says that's mutually assured destruction. Norms matter. And this is the conversation about the filibuster. This is the conversation about the blue slips and all the do we reinstate blue slips? Blue slips are, will you explain what blue slips are? Yeah, blue slips are just a very, very old Senate tradition that allowed home state senators, essentially a veto over a judge. And the blue slips are the reason, by the way, that there were judicial vacancies that piled up in Texas and in South Carolina, North Carolina, there were districts where you hadn't seen a judicial vacancy filed in years because Republican senators said, no, blue slipped all of the Obama, no Obama judge nominations. And the blue slip procedure, which isn't written to law, it was just tradition was upheld during that period of time. Yeah, this was, this was preserved and the minute Mitch McConnell got what he wanted in Donald Trump, he just gutted it. And so there were a lot of vacancies to fill and they were quickly filled again with some of them with 35 year old bloggers. And you know, we have to figure out what the antidote to that is. And it's worth remembering this was an Obama problem, right? When Obama was asked when he was on the campaign trail and he was asked, you know, what do you think of a Brennan or a Marshall putting them on the Supreme Court as a kind of, you know, tonic to the Scalia's and the Thomas is in Barack Obama said to the Cleveland Plain dealer at some open Mike thing with them. He said, no, the time for that kind of judges over. And I will put centrists on the court because change shouldn't come from the judicial branch. It should come from the political branches. And he made good on that. He put a lot of sort of centrist old guys on the courts. You know, he didn't want to go nuclear having seen what Bush judges did and were. And so I think it is just there is a sort of by temperament, a symmetry to just break and stuff. And you and I are sitting here. We're not nihilists. Like we're not going to pack the courts. We're not going to change change the vote. But I think that one of the things we all have to reckon with in this moment is how we extract ourselves from this. If one side as we're watching the impeachment is going forward saying like, I am sure is hella gonna impeach the next president, probably just for wearing a tan suit. And the other side that has sort of said this was catastrophic. And how do we retreat from from this kind of bringsmanship? And that for me is a question that I absolutely can't. Well, and I want to talk a little about what the courts have looked like under the Trump years. One thing that I think is been a theme in Trump litigation and has sort of meant they've lost a lot. But the scary thing is when they don't lose is just all this bad faith. I mean, in the census case, the most famous where they're just like lying straight up lying to the court and the district court judge there, Furman is like, you know, in his own understated way, like live it. Like you guys came in here and lied to me left and right. And then they like discovered a thousand new documents, by the way, as they're like trying to escape like formal sanction from the courts. But there's all this stuff they're doing all the time, like these like judgments before cert that they're trying, they're constantly trying to get with their skipping appeals courts, like explain their legal method and how it shows a certain kind of cynicism in terms of how they think of the courts, which is that we've got a five form majority on the spring court. Let's get there as fast as possible. Yeah. I mean, probably the most emblematic trend is these abortion regulations, right, which is, you know, this is beyond the trap laws. This is beyond what we have in Louisiana that's going to the Supreme Court in March in June medical. This is all the states who are just like, dude, we have five. Let's just pass an all out, you know, heartbeat, heartbeat law. Let's pass, you know, crazy stuff that is deliberately nullifying Roe v. Wade in Casey. And so I think that there has been this zeitgeist that says we have five, we may not always have five. Let's get it done. And so you see it really acutely there. But I think your question is also the justice department is really enabling that, right? Like the justice department, which keeps leapfrogging cases. You know, you don't need to go through the intermediate courts. Let's go straight to the Supreme Court. And we don't even need a trial record. Let's just get it done. And we're seeing it time and time again. We're also seeing for what it's worth this justice department in addition to rushing cases to the court without letting it play out and percolate through the system. We're also seeing, and this is shocking if you live in Kate's world or my world, the justice department flipping sides on a record number of cases. So we have right, a justice department that was, you know, for DACA is now against DACA for the Affordable Care Act. Now aggressively litigating against it. And there's just a long standing norm, Chris, that it doesn't matter who the president is. The justice department doesn't flip sides in cases because it's unseemly and it's not that president's justice department. It's supposed to be consistent across, you know, across different administrations. It was a huge, huge thing when the Obama Justice Department started to go hinky on, you know, gay rights because that felt like it was a massive shift away from what DOJ policy had been. And here we have the bar justice department just throwing, you know, throwing it all up in the air and saying, yeah, we don't care what. In fact, if the Obama Justice Department was for it, we hate it. And that's a big norm violation that we've seen. But I think just generally there is this kind of recklessness, this sense that we want to do as much as we can. We want to do it fast. The census case was a really good example of John Roberts finally blocking. And I think you're quite right. The only reason John Roberts switched his vote in that case was pretty clear at oral argument. He was going to be fine with adding the citizenship question to the census is that the court has got pants. I mean, really, as that litigation was pending, all these secret, you know, Ho Feller files come out. It becomes clear that Wilbur Ross just materially lied about the purpose of the question. And John Roberts, it turns out, has a breaking point and it's being pantsed. Like it's just being utterly humiliated and lied to. But I don't think that generally I've seen a lot of resistance at the Supreme Court level to the way that this Jeff Sessions and Bill Barr Justice Department have been sort of careening through history, trying to break stuff. And in fact, you know, it's interesting because when I look at the DACA case, when I look at the cases on the docket this year, the Title VII protections for gay and transgender workers, the court seems to just have very little problem with how things are done. You know, yeah, it was erratic. Yeah, Trump did it in a tweet, you know, but all's well that ends well. This court does not seem to be in any way bothered by the sort of sniff test problem that some of the lower courts have have contended with. What do you mean by sniff test? Well, like if I think that in a lot of this litigation, the lower court said, if you're going to rescind something, don't do it by a tweet. If you're going to rescind something, don't have like Kirsten Nielsen, like cough up a hairball of a rationale for why we're rescinding DACA. Like make it look like you care. And the lower courts still sort of have at least some sense that looking like you care is the thing that maybe the Justice Department should do. But it's really been interesting at the Supreme Court level. And again, maybe the best example of that is, oh my God, they have taken cert in a case that literally will overturn whole women's health. That was decided three years ago. And whole women's health just for folks that are not clear as a set of abortion restrictions that were passed in Texas, they were extremely onerous. Would have I think put all of the clinics out of I think all but four were going to be be I mean, it was going to be for the vast majority of women in Texas would not have been able to access to a clinic. And the Supreme Court struck it down as a violation of Roe and then Casey, right? There's a continuity of the jurisprudence that said, I think the term is undue burden is the standard that is articulated in Casey that this violated that. This was an undue burden. And basically what's happened is Louisiana has passed identical law and the courts granted cert because now we have the votes. Yeah. The only legal Mark Stern at Slate put it this way on my podcast. He said the only legal question that really exists in this Jew medical abortion case is whether the substitution of Anthony Kennedy with Brett Kavanaugh makes a difference in the undue burden standard. I mean, that's that's the only question, but it's a really good example of, you know, this is a court that was thinking about, huh, optics matter maybe wouldn't take a case to overrule it three years later. Same with the New York guns ban, right? The Second Amendment case, it was mooted by subsequent events. Court heard it anyway. So I think there is just this slightly frothy at the mouthy eagerness to get this stuff done. Except this is my favorite example of bad faith, which in this drives me nuts. I've tried to sort of articulate on the show, but because it involves like, like civil procedure is a little hard, but there's been a bunch of cases where the Trump administration is lost at the district court level. There's the appeals circuit courts, which is the intermediate level and then the Supreme Court. Usually what happens is you lose the district court, you appeal to you appellate court. And then if you lose there, then you appeals Supreme Court. And in a bunch of cases, they've lost the district level and just have been like, we don't need the appellate court. We're going straight to SCOTUS because that's where we have, we can count to five. And then there's the ACA case where it's like everything else. They've been like, we got to get to the Supreme Court. Come on, we're doing this. We're doing this in the ACA case where they are backing incredibly politically, nuclear Lee unpopular litigation to destroy the ACA, the entire government, all 2,200 pages, all the things you like about it, including the thing you might not like, but things you do like, they wanted the district court level. The circuit court sort of remanded it back to the district court for no reason, for no reason, mostly to just Terry. So it's not an election. You're a problem. Essentially said, yeah, you should have another look at this because it's an election. After the election. Yeah, no, there was no. And then DOJ says, we don't need Supreme Court to step in the blue states, the attorneys general said, no, no, let's get the Supreme Court on the record in the election year, but we're going to destroy the whole fucking ACA, excuse my language. And this Justice Department, which has been rushing to the Supreme Court for everything, was like, oh, no, no, rush, no rush. It's just the ACA that we want to get rid of. No rush this year. And it's just like, give me a break. Give me a break. So the story I tell, and I only tell it because Erwin Schamerensky, who's the wonderful Dean at Berkeley Law School, told it on my podcast at the beginning of this year, is that the only thing you need to know about this insane docket, right? We've got Title VII, we've got DACA, we've got abortion, we've got guns. Like, there's nothing that isn't on the docket this year. Arguments being heard by the Supreme Court this year, we say the docket. Yes, this term. And Erwin said, and I did not really clock this at the time, every single one of the cases could have been heard last January, a year ago this month. They were all calendared for discussion. They were debating all of them. The Supreme Court did not take any of these last year. Why? Why? Because of Brett Kavanaugh. Because they had... Always too soon. Too soon. And look, do I know that for a fact? No. But I think I'm pretty confident that when you're, you know, got these like 31% popularity ratings, and because women were in the streets, right, in their handmaid's tail outfits, John Roberts, very savvy guy, was like, you know what, let's just hold all these over. Let's take the heat off, Brett. Let's take, hold all these over. They took the two big ticket cases they took were the gerrymandering case they had to, and the census case that we talked about, everything else waited until October. That tells a bunch of stories that may be dovetail with some of what we're talking about. But the big story it tells is that John Roberts is really, really savvy about optics, and that he didn't want in the weeks after Brett Kavanaugh the most, even including Clarence Thomas, I think, contested seat in our lifetimes. He didn't want to have the court take a big honking abortion case and a big honking DACA case and a big honking guns case. And so they just went dark. Although the flip side of that is they're going to decide all these in election year. Well, that was the bad part of the thinking. Right. Because like, a whole woman's health, like I just purely on the politics, not on the law and the substantive attack on women's reproductive autonomy. But purely on the politics, like, I think it is bad for the Republican Party and the anti-abortion movement to win a big legal victory like this in an election year. Maybe I'm wrong, but I do think there will be backlash. What do you think? There will be that. And to boot, then the court went and took the follow on to Hobby Lobby and the Little Sisters case, but taking a huge contraception case. It seems to me that if women are watching, this will be an absolutely massive year at the Supreme Court. Now, I say if women are watching because there's so much going on that it's hard to believe that anything can break through. I do think, and this is where, again, I've heard your wife talk about this more than I've talked about it, but I do think there is reason to believe that John Roberts on some of these issues knows what's going on. I also think there is reason to believe that Elena Kagan, who is the only other super high EQ, savvy justice of the nine, is working the levers a little bit to say, really, really, you want to do all of this plus Don McGahn, plus the law of Trump, plus the tax returns, plus preside over an impeachment trial, you know, right? Right. Right. So they're going to have, right. They're also going to get the president's tax returns and compelled testimony. They're going to get that too, right? Yeah. I think so. I think that the court docketed those for the very end, by the way, those again could have been faster. Could have done, right? Could have been faster. Judge Surica, like all of the Nixon tapes case, like happened in a couple of weeks with the court, was like, yeah, this seems like it's really urgent. Let's hear it in April. So it's again up to the court to decide whether they want to do something expeditiously, but I do think all of these cases are piling up. And I'm quite sure that Clarence Thomas doesn't care. The electorate thinks about the court, but I'm also quite sure that John Roberts cares a lot. Well, let's talk about Roberts because he ends up being in the Roberts court now with the departure of Anthony Kennedy and with Kavanaugh replacing him. He is now the median judge. Like he's the middle of the court. I think it's fair to say. Yes. In most big cases, he was the crucial fifth vote on the census case, which he appeared to switch over, which by the way, just taking a step back, the fact that four of them voted to say, yeah, this is fine. What you've done. You've lied to the court. You've lied to Congress. You materially misrepresented what you were doing to hide essentially a nefarious motive. And just little sidebar that Clarence Thomas does a little weird Homeland string wall thing. Like he's actually mocking Judge Furman in his dissent, like talking about judges and fanciful conspiracy, like going after an article three judge perfectly comfortably, not just that four of them signed on, but that it's now cool to go after the trial judge who painstakingly laid out the conspiracy you just described. So Roberts, who is right now as we're talking on the TV screen presiding on the piece of trial, is a crucial figure. One of those crucial figures in American life right now. And I want to talk about him right after we take this quick break. So Chief Justice John Roberts is now the kind of swing vote, which means the court is much more conservative. And people on the court always hate it when you map it onto this because they point out that 90% of the cases are, you know, eight one on like some orissa question or like railroad law. And like that's true. But the ones on the sort of most salient along the lines that America is polarized on, they tend to be very close. And how do you see Robert seeing his own role in this? You just talked about how savvy he is. Whenever anybody says he's a swing vote, I have to stop and say he has won three times right. Like once the census case and the two affordable care act cases. So he's not, I mean, I think occasionally he is to the, you know, slightly left of the conservative block. But I think, you know, the famous study that was done by Judge Posner and Landis that sort of laid out the most conservative judges since the New Deal. And Roberts is like solidly in the top damn. So let's, I think we have to be clear that he is not. He's also a life, he's a made man. He's a things hadn't worked out the way they did. He could be up there with Philbin arguing for the president. Like he's, they're all of the same, Josh Hawley, Ted Cruz, Roberts, Philbin. Like they're all products of the exact same pipeline, pipeline of like right wing legal stars. Right. Federalist society, you know, Reagan administration. I don't think anybody should have any illusions that he is Anthony Kennedy. Anthony Kennedy was legitimately, and I say this like laughing because five years ago, I would have said to you, Anthony Kennedy is an incredibly conservative guy who has like swung to the left in a handful of cases. Which is true. And we have this fantasy of him being in play all the time. And we used to say that about O'Connor too, by the way. She was legitimately, I think a swing voter. So Roberts is just stipulated one of the most conservative jurists in this country in the last hundred years. But he has changed a lot because he is chief. And he takes being chief unbelievably seriously, Chris. He sees it as a sort of a direct handoff from Chief Justice Marshall to Chief Justice Rancwhist to him. And people think that it doesn't mean anything to be chief. It's just, you know, who gets to assign opinions. But he really does feel that in his hands lies the dignity and the esteem and the estimation and the public regard for the court. And if you read his sort of state of the judiciary speech that he does right before New Year's Eve, he was at pains. Like that was a speech. Yeah, it was a fascinating document. That really was I think seven pages of special pleading like America don't hate judges. We're people too. We have soft silky fur. We're not scary. And you know, let me just, you know, call out a really cool awesome judge who reads with, you know, poor children in DC, Mary Garland, but I won't name him. Mary Garland. Like it was a really amazing sort of tour de force of judges are people too. And the judiciary, all it has is public regard. He really lives and breathes that he worries about that. I think that's my short answer to why all that stuff was not on the docket last year. So I think like it's complicated because he's getting everything he wants, right? It's Christmas in July. Everything he wants. That he's worked his whole life and career for. I mean, these are things he, you know, particularly on abortion, I think. And race. And race. And really more than almost anything. Yeah. He's a race man. That he feels like, you know, the way to get beyond race is get beyond race, right? That's what he wrote. But I think it's fair to say this. These are his load stars and he's getting everything he wants. And that said, maybe this goes to the question we almost open with, which is when does it go so far that it breaks? I think that as worried as I am about that, when does the judiciary get so corrupted that it's broken? I think John Roberts lies awake at night asking himself the same question. And I think it's not an accident. Mark Stern and I wrote about this, that it's not necessarily John Roberts clerks who are all over the Trump administration. It's Clarence Thomas clerks. This is not how John Roberts wanted it to roll. I don't think he has great affection for this president. I think he punched back really hard when the president started saying, you know, Obama judges bad, Bush and Trump judges good. It's the only time that John Roberts kind of got into it with this president. I think that somewhere in the hippocampus, he knows that destroying the judiciary is real. It's possible destroying rule of law, destroying norms is real. And he worries about that. Although I will say that like we all lived through Bush v. Gore, which I think would have done it and didn't like to me that that was the most it was so naked. There's the infamous line infamous line in Bush v. Gore, which is a finding about the extreme burden of the 14th amendment that they that they then right in the opinion should not be applied as president anywhere else. I mean, it's just a preposterous in my humble and amateur nonlegal opinion, a ridiculous sort of show of Wilts power. And the reason I think about Bush v. Gore and my mind a lot is like, to me, that is where the rubber is going to hit the mother effing road because I feel like this is going to be a 50 50 coin flip election. I think the odds of us ending up in a situation where like Wisconsin's decided by thousand votes and maybe Arizona is to or maybe Pennsylvania is to. I think about that all the time. And I bet you he thinks about that all the time too. I'm sure he does. And I'm sure he also thinks, you know, when I again, I'll go one further when I think about sort of disaster scenarios, I think about, you know, Professor Josh Geltzer, who wrote a year ago, even if he loses, Donald Trump is not going to step down. And like there is going to be like some kind of mega constitutional crisis where he just says no matter what the election was, like, no, I think it was, you know, or I'll tie it up in the courts. Yeah. Like, I mean, we've already know what the play will be like, I'm going to file a million losses. I'm going to sue the electors. I'm going to sue the state. I'm going to sue the state secretary of state. I'm going to s- and right, which by the way, that was the Brooks Brothers revolution in which Vigour right? One side just decided we were going to go in here and lawyer the crap out of this and the other side, like, I don't know, crocheted things. I don't know. Well, they've ordered it too. They just lost. Yeah. No, but I think that there wasn't that we, you know, we will win it all costs. I'm not sure that was the zeal was there. And I think that that is really redoubled now. And so when I think about what John Roberts worries about, it's whether it's a contested election or whether it's Trump refusing to step down, the court saying you will turn over your Maizars records. And Donald Trump just saying no. One of those things I think is going to land in his lap sooner rather than later. I think that's exactly right. And I think we are careening towards that. I think right now a lot will ride on how that shakes out. Dalia Lithwick, senior legal correspondent for Slate. She's host of a fantastic podcast herself.
