That is a baby! Not a binary! Dave Rubin back in the free state of Florida and I have to tell you although I did enjoy our three days in DC and obviously we will recap a little bit of that today it was just so good landing in Florida like as the plane when they're like the descent has begun I actually become Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar remember that moment in Interstellar when he's watching all of the videos that he's missed over the years when he's on that that journey into space and time and everything's bending around him and he's seeing his children grow up and all of these things happen in life and his father-in-law passes away and he's crying tears of joy and his fake that's me landing in Florida every single time I am so happy to be back here amongst the joyous free people we did have a great three days in DC I mean it was jam-packed I want to just go through quickly before we get to the show today the list of people that we interviewed and a little bit sort of behind the scenes of what it

I sat down with Dan Crenshaw from Texas Ron Johnson Center from Wisconsin obviously Matt Gates congressman from Florida Lauren Boebert Congresswoman from Colorado McCarthy Kevin McCarthy who obviously now congressman from California but he's the speaker of the House Senator JD Vance Congressman Jim Jordan Congressman Byron Donald's Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Green and we got to clean up a lot of sort of the rumors and stuff around her my own Congresswoman it was the first time I ever met her and I absolutely love this woman it was just a serious joy you probably don't even know her name she hasn't sort of gone nationally up but I hope this helps amplify her a little bit Maria Salazar she was just wonderful we did a live show yesterday at noon that you may have seen with Senator Ted Cruz and then we finished up yesterday with Chip Roy from Texas and Thomas Massey from Kentucky now as I said we did not get any Democrats I want to be clear we reached out to over a dozen Democrats for the first two days nobody even responded now every Republican that we reached out to at least responded we were actually supposed to have two other Republicans that we were going to sit down with we were going to sit down with Senator Marcia Blackburn from Tennessee but then obviously there was this horrific shooting which we'll be covering a little bit today so she didn't come to DC she was back home in Tennessee and then we were also supposed to sit down with Senator Rand Paul from Kentucky but in a like beyond horrific incident one of his staffers was stabbed fatally wound not fatally wounded it was it was seriously wounded though he was stabbed multiple times from what they can tell it was completely random it had nothing to do with him Rand Paul himself or the guy's job sounds like the guy will be okay but obviously Rand Paul had to had to cancel on that on the Democrat side for the first two days nobody responded to us then finally believe it or not Ilhan Omar's people said we'll get back to you they never got back to us and Rashida Tlaib's people just gave us a no and you know me I like to give credit where credit is due I'll take a no and you've told me something and by the way they don't owe me anything we gave them you know a week's notice or sometimes may have been two or three weeks in some cases some of them were somewhat last minute but the Congress is in session these guys they're politicians they don't have that much to do so you'd think they'd want to be interviewed by people I'm not noted as the most hardball interviewer on the planet I would treat them with respect but I will give Rashida Tlaib this is a once-in-a-lifetime moment Dave Rubin I'm getting applause here in studio is giving Rashida Tlaib credit because her people actually responded and said no and Ilhan Omar's people at least responded with a non-response but nobody else even responded and ironically or I guess not ironically I guess obviously actually would be a better word for it obviously that right there the idea that a certain set of people are willing to sit down talk about their ideas again I challenge these guys on different things it was obviously it's I always do it you know me so I do it in as friendly a manner as possible some of these people I do consider friends and I also don't pretend to hide my feelings so I asked almost every single one of those people what do they think about this Trump to Santa's divide I have opinions on it too you've got guys like Matt Gates who were totally in Trump camp you've got guys like Chip Roy who has who has already endorsed DeSantis even though DeSantis hasn't even announced he's running but we can all do it and sit there and be respectful and that really was one of the interesting things about being in DC I also want to give a shout out to the hundred or so people that showed up we did a live interview with Kevin McCarthy in the Capitol in the Rayburn room and we had about a hundred local subscribers who joined us it was great great seeing you guys and then everybody broke off and did tours of the Capitol and as Kevin McCarthy said repeatedly the people's house is now open there was a certain energy there there was a feeling like maybe some sanity can come back but the problem guys is that if one side wants sanity and something like civility and the other side just wants you know as what I always say is that endless descent to hell and and the anger and you're all bigots and racists and you want to kill kids and the rest of it we got a problem because how do you how do you connect those two things that you know it's like connecting two batteries with the same side and it's just not going to work right you need you need two pieces to that fit to come together and that's what we're dealing with right now so the theme today really is civility versus uncivility and we have a couple clips that are going to lay that out for you really really easily including you may have seen a viral clip from yesterday this guy Bowman what's Bowman's first name Jamal Bowman who's a congressman from New York about an hour after I left Thomas Massey so I had Thomas Massey and Shiproy our studio was about I don't know maybe half mile from the Capitol about an hour after we finished our interview Thomas Massey who couldn't be nicer he's kind of a dorky guy he's like an electric engineer he wears a dead clock an electronic dead clock on his jacket like the guy couldn't be nicer more friendly smiley like the type of person that you would want in politics right not an ideal I like you get what he he says what he believes this guy Jamal Bowman Democrat from New York just went off on him in in the halls of the Capitol and it was caught on video and it's just showmanship and rudeness and getting in his face and actually I think kind of pushing him a little bit like it really was just awful so we're gonna compare and contrast the two sides and see what's what before we do that let me talk to you guys about balance and nature you guys know that nothing is more fundamental than the fact that fruits and vegetables are good for you someone said that to you in your kid right but eating all the fruits and vegetables you need can be time-consuming and expensive that's why I take balance of nature it gives me a foundation of nutrition and the positive effects of a wide variety of fruits and vegetables in just a few seconds see why hundreds of thousands of people take balance of nature every day get 35% off your preferred order when you use discount code Dave that's right 35% off your first order just by using discount code Dave and now back to me I did take some of them this morning and can't you see I'm full of fruit and vegetable right now all right let's talk about civility or the lack there of obviously there was this horrific shooting in Tennessee we are going to get to some of the specifics of it and some of the fallout but you guys know what happens when when one of these shootings occurs depending on the skin color and religion of the shooter depending on the skin color and religion of the victims we either blow it up and make it a huge story right when I say we I mean the mainstream media or we completely hide it if it doesn't fit the narrative and this one because it apparently was a trans shooter and Christian victims does not fit the media narrative so the mainstream corporate press people are going bananas because this one was too horrific to ignore but they don't know how to put this into their sort of very binary brains where they can't really think of things think about things holistically they can only do partisan attacks so here is yeah it's the view it's the view that's good that's good here is Joy Behar on the view going off on Senator Marsha Blackburn because she is a senator from Tennessee talking about how she doesn't care about kids now just remember again we were supposed to sit down with Marsha Blackburn that day she did not come to DC because obviously she stayed home in light of what had happened in Tennessee here's Joy nothing they'll do nothing they do nothing it's all about the money you know Marsha Blackburn is a senator from Tennessee she of course sent out her thoughts and prayers she is 13th on a list of senators who received the most money from the NRA she received over 1.3 million in donations while representing a state with 1,273 gun deaths a year okay follow the money this is what this is all about the gun lobby all these people who are selling guns they make a lot of money off of children's deaths apparently in this country they're worrying about you know other people books baloney items baloney items pretty sure the injectables her face are filled with baloney lady there's just so much here look let me try to do this and I'm gonna try to do this in like a calm non-partisan way first off that her original notion that they do nothing meaning Republicans and conservatives do nothing when these shootings occur all right that is based in the I would say canard that somehow if you give people guns or if people are to exercise their Second Amendment rights it is your Second Amendment right to be able to defend yourself your home your property your family etc you are it is it is the bill of rights they protect our rights they didn't give us our rights right God God gave us our rights we have inherent human rights the idea that they do nothing Republicans do nothing because people got shot the implication is that most people if they had access to guns would just start shooting and murdering people and that simply is not true right a gun in and of itself can do good things and bad things a gun can shoot a guy on his way to murder somebody that's good a gun can accidentally go off and kill an innocent person that's bad it's like fire fire can heat your home that's good fire can burn down your home that's bad so the idea that they will do nothing as if because what she's really saying is after these things happen they should do what we want and what we want is to take away the gun so here you have a lifelong New York liberal trying to tell the people of Tennessee how they should live it's kind of funny because I don't sense a lot of people in Tennessee trying to tell the New York liberal how to live they're just saying to the New York liberal stay out of our freaking lives and that is one of the differences that we have right now between the attitude of I would say the blue state people and the red state people so that was that was one piece of that then of course it's follow the money that that Marsha Blackburn only has these beliefs her belief in the Second Amendment because of the NRA you know it's funny as far as I know Phoenix you can double check me on this on the fly as far as I know no mass shooter in American history has ever been a member of the NRA there have actually been members of the NRA like in that Texas church shooting about a year ago who stop and kill the shooter because they have guns and they are properly trained and everything else but this idea that that everyone who doesn't believe what you believe is somehow bought off they are controlled by the NRA it's just it's just absolutely disgusting and so yeah so she's connecting it's they do nothing money and the NRA those are the big pieces there what she really wants is hey let us control you by the way Illinois you know she referenced the amount of shootings in in Tennessee Illinois had is that 1,741 deaths or is that deaths by shooting deaths by shooting Illinois and Illinois gun deaths Illinois has basically the strictest gun laws in the entire country anyway it continued on the view because the other part when I mentioned how sometimes if the if the color of the shooter or the ideology of the shooter fits and the victims if that fits the narrative and we know what that narrative is they love it if it's a white Christian shooting minorities then this is the greatest thing ever for the media if it doesn't work out that way they don't know exactly what to do with it in this case it was a trans shooter going into a Christian school now you would believe by by any notion if someone walks into a temple and shoots a bunch of Jewish people it is obviously somehow connected to their religion much like this is obviously connected to their religion of Christianity but that does not compute for these people it does not work in their very deranged worldview so here is whoopi having no knowledge no knowledge of what she is saying saying that no this was not about these people being Christians and until that conversation becomes a real conversation that everybody's willing to get on board with children are going to keep getting shot people in churches are going to keep getting shot I heard one guy say well you know this is this is against the Christians no it's not against the Christians because you would have mentioned it when they went into the black church and you would have said this is an issue we should be thinking about what you did so let's not do that let's not make it let's not make it about transgender people let's not make it about anything but what it is we have a problem with this gun and its accessibility in this country she's just wrong she's just fundamentally wrong you know I have guns in this house I would never take those guns and go into a church or a mosque or a school and shoot someone I have those guns so I can protect my family and my property I know that several of the other people in this room have guns and that's the same reason they have it it's about mental illness and ideology that's what this is about but she dismisses all of that and it's really bizarre that she she really doesn't want you to think it has anything to do with the victims being Christian but it obviously does this person was not happy with the way they perceive Christian people to treat trans people okay you know there's this manifesto supposedly I think it's a 27 page manifesto that they're trying to figure out whether they should release right now and I'm actually 50 50 on whether they should release it I was discussing it off camera with Thomas Massey because on one hand I'm for transparency obviously right and so on one hand you'd want to get it out so you'd have a little more insight into actually why did this person do this the problem though is that once you release it and then it goes viral and people are clipping it and reading it and it's red everywhere and the people everyone knows this person's name and all that you're actually incentivizing the copycatters to go boy if I do something unimaginably evil like evil that is that is so anti-human that you really can't think about it killing children the media will read my scribe they will read my rant and I will become famous after life so there is a push in a poll on that that I think you can make good arguments on on both sides but she is completely dismissive of the fact that the victims were Christian she only wants to make this about guns and she somehow connects that to when when there has been shootings in black churches except whoopi when when there have been shootings in black church churches it's because they're going after black people and they're going after Christians who happen to be black in those churches you're the one disconnecting reality from all of this this is about mental illness and it's probably and I think we will find more about this and we usually do it's about mental illness and it's about prescription medication and and what this stuff is doing to warp minds and then you take these warped minds and you throw them in a world that has endless scroll where boys are girls and girls are boys and not racists are racists and all of the untruths that we know about you do that over and over and over again to a 14 year old brain and by the time that brain is 18 years old it might do something horrific it might absolutely do something horrific on top of the fact that I don't want to speculate too far but as several people have brought up if this person was in fact trans it's a little unclear to me whether this person had transitioned all the way or whatever it was but we know that this was a biological girl who was going by he-him pronouns and there was some level of the trans stuff there if it turns out that she was on testosterone which is what they put young girls on when they are transitioning them right their bodies do not create it so then they are trying to make them mail you put them on testosterone do you think testosterone has a little something to do with aggression do you think that might be a piece of this so this one this one I'm telling you guys this one's gonna be pushed under the rug swept under the rug so quickly because every piece of it from the the shooter the evil shooter and the warped mind that did this to the victims none of it computes the way that these things are supposed to compute for the system and if the system is really good at one thing it's good at hiding the things that don't fit the grand narrative we got a whole bunch more let me talk to you about fast growing trees real quick you know you could breed some life into your own backyard with fast growing trees dot com this spring I just

basically leave that there we'll see what more info comes out but yes it is one of those things where they're going to go after one side is going to go after the guns you know one side is probably going to try to go over over the top I'm going after trans people I don't blame anyone but the shooter and perhaps the the psychiatrist and and the people you know whoever was infecting this young person's mind with the bad ideas that would lead them to this that that's where you lay blame you don't blame blame on on a collective of individuals that's what we're always trying to fight around here but what this all leads us to is something about civility because it is seemingly going out the window I try to do my best with it but you guys know that I joke and I drop some f bombs and talk about the socialists and all the crazies and sometimes you have to and and as many of you said to me when we went out for drinks on Tuesday night after the McCarthy interview you guys dig that because you're feeling it too it's a release some of it is a silly release right I'm certainly I don't think anyone in their right mind would say I'm trying to gin up hate here I know there are people who do say that but I don't think they're in their right mind but civility especially in politics is is being completely wiped away and as I mentioned I interviewed Thomas Massey yesterday alongside Chip Roy Thomas Massey Congressman from Kentucky he is he is just a light fun be sent guy he's the type of guy you're like I can't believe you're a congressman because you're just kind of like a goofy fun guy he's he's also brilliant and he has his house running completely off the grid using an old broken Tesla battery I mean the guy's done some amazing stuff in any event he is a proponent of the Second Amendment he does believe in gun rights he owns several guns he has been a strong supporter of the Second Amendment etc he was walking in the halls of the Capitol this is we were right in this very room what the video we're about to show you we were in this room my whole team was in the room a few hours earlier and here is Thomas Massey basically getting accosted by New York Democrat Jamal Bowman over the shooting and just watch the difference in tone in content and behavior it's rather extraordinary look at the day I'm more busy than more dust good states that have open-town laws that weren't dead states that have open-town laws have more dead I will listen to what I'm saying that doesn't want to talk to their children dying not their own children because they're supposed to have Harvard teachers that's not working in school have you ever worked in a school I've never worked in school I've never worked in a school it's a guess if I'm already happy you are about to the same you will not answer my question don't stop and talk to me okay I'll bring it down all right I've got a bill to appeal I work in the school New York's funny years I wasn't I was a straight before you came in to every I work in the school for 20 years I work in school 20 years in every school I was a very counselor I was a middle school principal I was in cafeterias every day of my career there's time we're gonna shoot it's time we've got here to protect us why I believe the kids should have somebody to protect them every school that's allowed it has never had a shooting not even an accidental discharge there's so much there first off I mean look the obvious stuff like just the general behavior of these people Jamal Bowman is just grandstanding screaming getting in Massey's face he touches him a couple times Massey is clearly trying to explain something to him right he's clearly trying to explain hey you know and we all went through this firsthand there are metal detectors when you walk into the Capitol there are armed security guards everywhere literally every hallway every door outside inside everywhere now I'm actually not taking the position that that's what we want at every school because I do think over time if you sort of just militarize everything the changes in behavior for people will not be a net good I think there's a there's a psychological and mental component to this that we really have to deal with but the general idea of oh we all walk around with security we have metal detectors we have people out there but we let these schools not be guarded by anything is clearly the right one so there's a tone issue and that Bowman is doing exactly what left these do with virtually everything it doesn't matter if you know what you're saying if you just stand in a big room knowing that there's cameras there and scream a certain amount of people think oh he has righteous indignation so he obviously is right but of course he is not you know there's another interesting piece of this as I mentioned and hopefully some of you guys saw it at noon yesterday we had Ted Cruz in and we did it wasn't an interview we just ran through clips with Ted Cruz about a bunch of things and we were talking about the Tennessee shooting Ted Cruz brought a bill to the floor about a year ago that would have had an armed guard at every school in the United States public school private school charter school etc. Every single Democrat ruled against it okay so now I get it they want to get rid of guns altogether because they only want in essence the state to have the guns because you know what's gonna happen then we'll all behave that really is what this is all about they want centralized power and a bunch of I don't know fish people basically with no backbones who are gonna behave as they wish so it's a it's a tone issue and it's a lack of understanding and also many keeps saying have you ever worked in a school have you ever worked in school it's utterly irrelevant it is absolutely utterly irrelevant Thomas Massey he kept his cool the entire time he tweeted this after he said he tweeted out the video as you can see and then he said he wanted to discuss solutions to school shootings but when I offered a solution he began shouting when he asked for data I gave him data but then he just shouted more bring facts there's never been a school shooting in the hundreds of schools that allow staffs to carry okay I want to go a little further with this because you really need to understand that what's happening in DC is indicative of what I started with at the top of the show we got I believe it was 12 Republicans to sit down with me too that had to cancel because of their own issues and no Democrats would talk to me this is a problem and when a guy like Jamal Bowman when he starts thinking that Thomas Massey is the extremist is the is the gun maniac and all that stuff we got a real problem so I thought we just show you just two little clips we're gonna post the full interview that we have with Thomas Massey and Chip Roy but I want to show you two little clips Thomas Massey his main thing is about debt this guy is into the financials he actually he made it himself we're gonna show this to you just a sec a debt clock a digital debt clock that he wears as a lapel pin okay and that's what he cares about most and you tell me does this guy just his tone everything about this guy does he strike you is the extremist that you want to be yelling at in the hallway Thomas I got to start with you because everyone's gonna be wondering about that thing right there yeah you have the debt clock on your lapel yeah where's yours you know I'm some people have a pacemaker up here a lot of these old senators I've got an anxiety maker I'm trying to make their hearts skip beats and become concerned by looking at the debt increasing each day it goes I wrote the software in here I made the case I've got some 3d printed ones I'm working on so Chip Roy can have a copy but it goes to the Treasury's website once a day gets the actual debt to the penny and then makes its best guess based on the average debt per second over the last year about what the debt is at this very moment I'm gonna guess that when you're back home in Kentucky or I should say Kentucky and Texas of course when you're back home in Kentucky people probably dig it you come here and everyone's like could you put that thing away a little bit of that the Democrats I had one in an elevator look at it and say is that a doomsday clock and I said yes ma'am idiots well they're always escalating escalating that situation funny it is a doomsday clock but they just don't fully realize it so as I mentioned I had on the republic inside a whole bunch of people Trump supporters the Santas people people that backed McCarthy for the speakership people that didn't act as a matter of fact both of those guys did not back McCarthy at first chip Roy especially was one of the most outspoken against McCarthy but they knew that the day before I had sat down with McCarthy I had gates on who's a big Trump guy and then I had Crenshaw who the base doesn't seem to be before I tried to bring in a plurality of opinions but what the theme with everybody was they are having a hard time talking to anybody on the Democrat side and I actually asked Massey about working with AOC and the progressives so when you guys when you guys see AOC afterwards talk about how this bill was basically passed by fascist it's like man she needs some better education because I don't know what it means or Hakim Jeffries you know they don't want to teach about the Holocaust I mean these were the responses you got out of these guys I've asked this to every Republican I've sat down with for the last three days are you talking to these guys in the back rooms going what the hell are you talking about you know that's not legit so I mean in the rules committee we debated this and Chip was right to point out they knew that this bill didn't ban books okay because we had already discussed that the day before in the rules committee before the debate came to the whole house they they knew it didn't ban books but they went down there and said it anyways because they knew a lot of their constituents wouldn't do the due diligence I find that what we were referring to right there is the bill that got passed a couple days ago this parental rights and education bill which is basically a sort of copycat version of what we've been doing here in Florida it's about transparency and education there's nothing about banning books there's nothing about you can't say gay there's nothing about hiding information about the Holocaust but AOC we showed you the clip a couple days ago literally was calling this bill passed by fascists you got the other one who came Jeffrey saying they don't want to teach about the Holocaust and the point is that these guys Massey Chiproy some of the other ones they get out there every day they try their best to explain why they're voting for things things that anyone I mean especially guys I could tell you as a new parent you want transparency especially related to your kids why would I ever want to send my kid to a school where I just know I am just simply not allowed to know what they are teaching that child like think how actually insane that is but this lack of civility does consistently seem to only go in one direction where are all of the videos of the Republican screaming at the Democrats and lying constantly about what they say actually they just don't exist but please send them to me if you can find them and I'll gladly show them to and I'm talking about I'm talking about people in Congress in the Senate right now not talking about the average guy on the street but I want to show you another video you may remember this this is from March 1st we showed you this clip Jamal Bowman again Congressman from New York this is on I believe it's the steps to the Capitol going after Byron Donald Byron Donald's is Congressman from here in southwest Florida he's a good dude a bunch of the Republicans who are supposed to be racist we're voting for him for speakership but okay whatever here's Jamal Bowman going after Byron Donald's because he supports I believe he calls him white nationalist Ron DeSantis he's a national is he's a white supremacist he's anti-gay no he's not he's not no he's anti-black listen there's no way he can be president former colleagues in the legislation who's the other one who's looking in Democrat when all that stuff was coming up last year I called them I said tell me what's happening they are like it's really not that but people are trying to raise a fuss I've had a conversation it's not true why are why are the why can't those who have been incarcerated who are released who have done their time why can't they be re-enfranchising be allowed to vote they are in our state no they're not man they got a lot of photos I'm going to vote I mean there's so much there he has no arguments right he's telling a black man that his friend I mean Byron Donald's and Ron DeSantis are friends at Ron DeSantis his reelection night remember that 20-point win 1.5 million vote win that he had back in November you know who opened for him the only politician on stage with him that night of the win yeah it was Byron Donald's okay former felons are allowed to vote in Florida so he also made that up and he's anti-black he's anti-women he's anti-gay and then this is the same guy who a month later is screaming at Thomas Massey about guns as if he wants people to be killed just because he believes in the Second Amendment but this what do we do with this and I and I really mean this as an open-ended question and maybe this will be an open-ended question for the remainder of the time that I do this program what do we do if we consistently are trying to explain what we believe why we believe it and and how we want to accomplish it if the other side is just there to lie about it and to hope and in their estimation take us out because we are the bad guys there was another interesting moment you know one of the people that I interviewed this was yesterday as well yesterday morning was Marjorie Taylor Green Congresswoman from Georgia now if you listen to the mainstream narrative on her she's a white nationalist and something about a Jewish space laser and she doesn't like black people or something and she's an insurrectionist I actually found her quite lovely she was very able to explain what she believes we talked about a little bit of everything but later in the day she was doing a hearing and they were talking about what happened in Tennessee and she's having a back-and-forth with what's his name Jason Moskowitz is it Jason Jeff Moskowitz represent I'm sorry representative Jared Moskowitz about shootings and sort of how she evolved on some of this stuff any question I'll yield to anyone on this committee who disagrees that murder in schools is not murder I yield will you yield oh I yield yes please yeah I was when I was an 11th grade and Joe Biden made our schools gun-free school zones one of the students in my school brought three guns to school and our entire school went on lockdown because he was the only person with a gun there was no good guy with a gun to protect us kids at school you want to know why the shooter is dead in Nashville the trans shooter you want to know why because a good guy with a gun killed that woman she identified as a man she was mentally ill probably taking hormones and she went in and murdered children and adults in this Christian school in Nashville so if you want to have a good talk about schools and protecting children we need to talk about protecting our children the same way we protect our president we protect our celebrities we're claiming my time okay thank you mr. Chair you got it it's just the truth these people exist and are able to scream about taking away our guns while they are protected by guns remember that video we showed you about a month ago as Gavin Newsom was walking the streets of California talking about how the GOP is in a suicide packed with the NRA because of guns and he's surrounded by like eight armed security guards because that's the only way he can go out in the state of California I know you guys get it but it's not just the congressman congresswomen and the senators who are disconnected from reality on the left it's also obviously the president and the president I would say is disconnected from reality when it comes to basically everything for several reasons some of the medical here is his first response this was the first thing that he said after the shooting ripping our communities apart ripping a soul this nation ripping at the very soul of the nation and we we have to do more to protect our schools so they are turned into prisons you know a shooter in this situation reportedly had two assault weapons in a pistol to 8k-47 so I call on Congress again to pass my assault weapons ban. No Joe you got it backwards first off okay the usual slurring that's fine he doesn't even know what he's saying again Ted Cruz a year ago tried to get an armed security guy at the front of every school so now imagine and there's no perfect system right there's always ways around a system I accept that but now imagine there's an armed security guard at the door of this school or any school right the shooter comes up now you have a standoff you have someone that is trained and prepared and ready to defend the students and the teachers and the faculty etc but every Democrat was against that so what the Democrats are doing while while the bodies are still warm the Democrats are saying how can we take guns from you and if you think for one second that if they can get whatever they want we want we want some of you automatics they don't even know what they're talking about right usually we always find this out they don't even know what the definition of the words mean they don't know the difference between magazine and clip they don't know any of this stuff but okay if you think for one second that if you give them an inch on guns they will stop oh we're good guys we got the guns we wanted let's wrap up shop and if you first of it's just it's an insane theory you would not understand the ideology of progressivism it is to progress always on your rights that's how it works but it's not just that it is that they will always do it and then they will move on to something else it's the second amendment that is protecting the first amendment right it's it's just it's just how it is here's another one by Biden where he's conflating a couple different issues on how Americans feel about guns in general take a look I don't know if that is true I don't know what we tried to find some numbers on that that the majority of Americans think that having assault weapons is bizarre we could not find that out but let's say that is true for a second I will try to make your argument for you Joe if the majority of Americans think that having assault weapons is bizarre does that mean then that you should take assault weapons from people should be we be ruled by a mob just because most people think something does that mean that it is right I think because I have a wise audience you guys know that that obviously is not the case imagine and you could end up in a situation like this where after generations of programming young people we could end up in a situation and I think we may be heading to that situation where the majority of people will think that the first amendment and free speech are bad they will think there are too many bad ideas out there to people have too many conflating and conflicting views on things there's too much quote-unquote hate speech etc and once that gets over that 50% threshold should we take away free speech should minority viewpoints not be allowed to be shared in the world that Joe Biden wants to live and apparently the answer is yes but then of course we had to show you a clip of cringe Jean Pierre where she just instead of just honestly saying we have to think about mental health we have to think maybe we actually are radicalizing now a whole generation of people because they're confused about their gender and their sexuality and all of these things and what that might lead to instead of having any honest assessment it's Republicans want to kill people because of guns we must do more and he wants Congress to act because enough is enough in his state of the Union the president called on Congress to do something to stop the epidemic of gun violence tearing families apart tearing communities apart how many more children have have to be murdered before Republicans in Congress will step up and act to pass the assault weapons ban to close loopholes in our background in our in our background check system or to require the safe storage of guns we need to do something most of those laws exist already that's number one but this idea that it's just how many more children have to die until Republicans do what we want how many more children have to die to republics is there like Constitution Constitution right no guys no but they can't they just can't deal with any of this honestly and do you think that might be why they'd be afraid to sit down with a guy like me like am I known as the the most combative interviewer I'm actually known as the reverse of that I used to get a lot of criticism because I was the reverse of that right people say Dave's a softball interviewer okay but they're afraid to sit down with me because what they want to do what she knows she can do is Biden can say his nonsense then she can filter it down and then the mainstream media just repeats it so they basically never have to be challenged on any of this and if you want to see how the mainstream media also obfuscates the obvious truth about this stuff look at this headline from Reuters I mean tell me this is not just evil former Christian school student kills three children three staff in Nashville shooting so apparently this trans activist was at one time a Christian school student and that is the way they chose to frame it just incredible then there's this guy Ben Ryan who he is an NBC guy we did we confirm that he's an NBC guy let's look at this tweet I mean is this just unbelievable NBC has ID the Nashville school shooter as Audrey Hale 28 who identifies as transgender and had no previous criminal record Nashville is home to the Daily Wire a hub of anti-trans activity by Matt Walsh Ben Shapiro and Michael Knowles Ben Shapiro Matt Walsh and Michael Knowles had nothing to do with this the Daily Wire being in Nashville had nothing to do with this we will find out more about the medication this person was on the ideology that this person was following what Ben Shapiro and Michael Knowles and Matt Walsh never said if you like us or dislike us or anything else you should take along to your own hands and kill people this is a mental health issue guys it is a mental health issue guys but look here's how the USA today covered this police on Monday afternoon said that the shooter was a transgender man officials had initially misidentified the gender of the shooter do you see how stupid this is it is so pro I don't care and no one in their right mind cares about the gender of this person right now right it's gonna become political because they've they forced this trans stuff on everybody but you see where the media is worried about oh my god did we miss gender the the murderer insane speaking of insane Don Lemon CNN go the police are identifying the shooter as a trans woman but actually be a trans man so there's sort of a misidentification there but this is all new I'm just wondering the identity of being a transgender person and also being identified as a woman does this pose any sort of difference or difficulty for the for police because it's not typically a woman regardless of how they're identifying so there are a couple of things here that are different and that we are going to have to talk about and delve into right so each of these cases is always going to have a particular difference right whether it's someone is angry at their father or someone had something happen at the school and this is a unique case and we have to be sensitive about it to the extent that Audrey Hale identified as a woman we do not see mass shooters who are female especially in particular school shooting murderers that is that is this is actually I think the first time that I can remember okay do you see how they're so focused on the wrong thing and how they are making they're basically running cover for a trans ideology because if this was a Muslim that went into a church and shot Christians nobody would be like oh we better figure this out but everyone would be and and probably correctly well first off I would still say if there's a mental health issue because again if you kill innocent people there's a mental health issue there but we would be able to maybe connect this to a religious ideology and there would be a certain amount of people by the way people on the right who then would be unjustly prejudice against Muslims if a Christian shooter went into a Jewish synagogue or a Jew went into a mosque right we would be able to somewhat clearly connect these things but in this one we better not misgender this person is a trans man or a trans woman this has never happened before we should be very careful blah blah blah as opposed to focusing on the real victims the way they talk about it the victim here is the is the shooter the victim here is the shooter you know because you know the daily wires in Nashville and you know somebody misgendered this guy or this gal insane absolutely insane here is a fake Republican you know these you know these pet Republicans I'm always talking about these pet Republicans that go on MSNBC he is a former congressman named David Jolly former I'm very happy to say he's former congressman because he was a Floridian congressman David Jolly and he's he's a pet Republican which basically means a Democrat he goes on MSNBC to just rail against Republicans and listen to just the way they frame this I mean it just yeah it's about race go it's it when you say the word gun violence one of the things that always strikes me here and you see it here is if you say the word crime Republicans there's no there's nothing that's too much to go after crime in the big cities crime crime is the enemy throw it if you say gun violence which is the probably the most deadly subset of crime all of a sudden it's like well what are you gonna do it's just as whatever the word is that just changes everything yeah Chris this is gonna be hard but for Republicans crime is something that's committed by black Americans yes right gun ownership and gun violence is something that is part of the culture of young white men and so Republicans protect it and that's just the real yes oh yeah of course yeah yeah crime only black people commit crime yeah yeah yeah yeah it's so weird because it seems to me that Republicans are the ones that care about crime in the big city thus fund the police so that there is less crime in their cities there's a reason that Denver is Denver for example has homelessness and drug use everywhere and Dallas does not one is run by a Democrat ones were by Republican hint hint and he's a muppet to this guy this Chris Hayes he's just a muppet but this David Jolly like yes how do you see how what they did like instead of dealing with the actual mental health issues are about this specific person in this ideology that is being pushed on children everywhere instead of dealing with the complexities related to that it somehow Republicans fault oh and also Republicans are racist when it comes to all this but not just that here's another lunatic from MSNBC Republicans also hate rule of law we now live in a society where the cops are afraid of the convicts were former presidents former presidents they make martyrs out of convicts who stormed the United States Capitol these these Republicans are the enemy of the rule of law my god they're talking about a trans shooter who shot up Christian school and he's making this about January 6 bananas bananas also cops are afraid of convicts you know it's funny they're not afraid of them here in Florida where we have rule of law and all-time low crime you know where they are we you know where cops are afraid and where cops are retiring early and where they're literally literally having to lower the physical fitness standards to become police officers New York because they defunded the police Minnesota because they defunded the police Seattle Portland San Francisco Los Angeles not Republican places bananas all right only one more from MSNBC I promise you know this guy we've shown a couple clips of this guy there's this guy what's his name what's his first name nod his first name to nod his last name I'm probably gonna mispronounce it is grid Haridas he looks like a villain from Gotham City I think he broke out of Arkham Asylum and he's terrorizing well I know he's terrorizing people because he's on MSNBC watch this and then more people see big problems in their lives that government can't solve and get demoralized about government which helps this extremist right ideology and it is sickening to watch them try to claim the idea of freedom I for me the freedom to remain alive or have my kids remain alive kind of comes first yeah but also they say free they talk about a freedom they talk about a freedom that they've made up in their own twisted heads because they've been they've been whipped into a paranormal you guys have that searing pain in your heads right now like a knife stabbing you in your Abdullah Abdullah yeah he's sort of right government can't solve problems governments not good at problems the nine scariest words in the English language I'm from the government and I'm here to help except he like every idiot at that table and everyone on MSNBC and everyone watching MSNBC their solution is always more money and more government the government is evil the government is corrupt government is is full of elitists pushing the people down what is the solution make it bigger make it bigger the I want the freedom to have my children alive well no shit so how about we scale that government which is the number one thing encroaching on all of our lives oh wait we have more MSNBC I'm sorry guys we do have more MSNBC remember John Heilman feel like I owe everybody an apology right I'm apologize it's you guys I apologize what can I do what can I do remember John Heilman he is the MSNBC hack who went on real time with Bill Maher about a month ago and Russell Brand just show he belayed this guy just absolutely fillet this guy here he is and remember the whole thing was about whether they lie on MSNBC intentionally here he is telling an insanely completely fictitious story about Republicans and Waco I don't even know what he's talking about here but go ahead taking semi automatic weapons making the machine guns and it was when the ATF saw evidence of that and the fact that David Kresch was raping young girls that they decided to try to make a move on Waco and that's what started the whole 51 day siege you know that's and those people are heroes now on the right David Kresch and and and the assault the Waco the bridge to Gideon's are now you know we'll take it we'll talk about this more later but that's how deep it goes and it's not new the only other thing I'll say is I agree any like you know some parts the culture are obviously broken and it's not all about policy Kresch is a hero on the right now I have three right wing maniacs in the room with me right now how many of you show of hands guys have a David Kresch you know like a bunch of pictures of David Kresch a shrine let's say to David Kresch in your bedrooms anyone in this room nobody in this room I have never met anyone on the right that thinks David Kresch is a hero now there might be some like radical really anti-government out there something or other that does but you see how he complaints that with every he's a hero on the right he's a hero on the right this is the same clown who a month ago got eviscerated by Russell Brand for saying that nobody on MSNBC intentionally lies then we showed you a massive compilation of him lying on MSNBC and then the guy blocked me on Twitter but for those of you who forgot here's Russell just taking him apart have to take responsibility for our own perspective I've been on that MSNBC me it was propaganda's not crackery on the show called morning Joe it was absurd the way they carried on morning Joe yeah I don't know what it was it wasn't morning there was no one called Joe there no one could concentrate they didn't understand the basic tenors of June journalism no one was willing to stick up for genuine American heroes like Edward Snow then no one was willing to talk about Julian Assange and what he suffered trying to bring real journalism to the American people and I think to sit within the castle of MSNBC throwing rocks have Fox News is ludicrous make MSNBC better make MSNBC bring again I would love that morning Joe it's not in the morning there was no one named Joe there it's just like anyway you get it these people they just lie about everything so now how can we wrap the show together today in a positive way I've had to apologize to you I think I cried a moment ago it's been a lot today right okay and then this is serious stuff this wasn't our funny show ever but how can we bring this together in a sane way look for those of us that are on this what I would say is this broad right coalition right now that's trying to figure out some stuff and it's going to get difficult it's going to get difficult because we're fighting a bunch of people who will yell at you and shout you down and call you racist and lie about you and all that stuff that you know but it's also going to get increasingly difficult in the next year especially because of the presidential politics portion of this right I've hit Trump a bit on this show no matter how many times I say I like the guy I went out of my way to support him it cost me a lot in friends and probably sponsorships and a whole bunch of other stuff but I don't regret it in any way whatsoever I haven't been thrilled with some of his behavior lately but as I said I sat down with as many Republicans as possible I sat down with hardcore ones in the Trump camp like Lauren Boebert and Jim Jordan and Matt Gaetz and talked to them about their support for Trump and they know my feelings about DeSantis and then I sat down with guys like Chip Roy and Thomas Massey who are let's say more in the DeSantis camp how are we going to do this without destroying each other or will we destroy each other maybe that's what the machine really wants right we will actually destroy each other and then congratulations we get four more years of mentally scrambled Joe Biden in the White House well I talked about just that with Matt Gaetz and I thought that would be a nice way to tie this all together Gaetz knowing that I'm more in the DeSantis camp at the moment and he's more in the Trump camp and and what do we do with that AOC you guys passed the parents rights and education thing and she's calling it fascism Hakim Jeffries is saying they don't want to teach you about the Hawkeyes like it's just like lies and craziness like is there anyone in there that can sort of stem that or do you think that's just about broadly I don't know the answer to that question but I do think we have to be willing to create alliances around issue sets where we may have a common ground take for example the surveillance state that we have I get real squeamish about the powers that the Patriot Act and other laws have fused into the national security state to deprive Americans of their liberties often in the absence of constitutional protections and I can find Democrats like Zolloftren on the judiciary committee or Rokana in the progressive delegation who will actually work with me to try to build enduring coalitions against an establishment that also includes both Republicans and Democrats. I'm sorry we showed you a different clip right there there's a clip that will show you tomorrow or that you'll see in the full interview which is actually the full interviews up already right the full interviews up already was the clip that I was referring to we just got back late last night so we had a little error there where I talked to him about the DeSantis Trump thing and we sort of agreed to disagree and walked away there like kind of high-fiving and shaking hands and it's all good obviously what we were talking about there was the other theme of the show today which was that hopefully we can find some people hopefully Gates can find some people he mentioned one or two right there we'll keep putting our hands out I promise you I will keep trying to interview people on the left if they will sit down I will keep trying to do it I will keep trying to to not go scorched earth when it comes to whatever is gonna happen with Trump and or DeSantis or anyone else like that's gonna be the challenge it will be very easy to do the other thing it's very easy to be the bowman of the situation it's very easy to just scream and find enemies everywhere but we're gonna have to do some work just one final thing for today Wall Street Journal put out a poll a couple days ago that's really really fascinating about some some disturbing trends in America right now talking about values let take a look at this what this is showing you here from 1998 to 2023 so in a 25 year span patriotism has dropped the the belief in the importance of patriotism has dropped from 70 to 38 percent the belief in the importance of religion has dropped from 62 to 39 percent the importance of having children 59 percent to 30 percent community involvement 47 percent to 27 percent the belief in the importance of money 31 which is risen to 43 percent which might have something to do with the amount of inflation we have people are like oh I best I do wish I had some more money but yes guys this is these this is disturbing those those numbers are all going in the wrong way I am not sitting here telling that you that you have to believe in a particular religion I am not sitting here telling you you have to have a flag waving outside of your house we've got a pretty massive one inside of my house or any of those things but if we don't get back to a place where we have something common whether that is a belief in the United States of America as a fundamentally decent project whether that is a belief in God or something beyond ourself whether it is a belief that being part of your community matters your local community so that you're you know you walk down the street you don't get shot and people actually take their garbage out and clean up when they see trash and all of those things it can derail pretty quickly so it is a battle for the culture and we have to decide what do we care about what are our priorities what are our shared beliefs I'm gonna keep doing it I'm gonna keep trying to expand those things right along with you guys it is gonna get tough it's gonna get tough like this thing is going this DeSantis Trump thing is going to get tough and nasty and everything else but I'll tell you guys having been in DC for three days I left the city believe it or not and when you watch my interview with Kevin McCarthy I think you'll see it he says something about how he still every day he goes into that Capitol Hill he still feels a sense of awe and I do believe him I feel it when I go in there it's like great people over generations and hundreds of years created these structures meaning these physical structures but then also these documents did so much freakin good we've still got it so freakin good but but we have to be able to defend it and we have to know when forces are coming to take it out and we have to figure out how we deal with that in a decent way in a law-abiding way we got a lot of work to do but as I often say I have nothing better to do and save the world I suspect you don't either in 37 seconds I'll be doing a post-game show if you want to ask me any questions comment did I screw up anything today let me know did I play too many clips of MSNBC I think we can all agree the answers yes my full interview with Dan Crenshaw is already up on YouTube and rumble the full one with get with Matt Gates is already up on YouTube and rumble all the others and I think it was about 12 in total we'll be going up over the next couple days we're doing them all we're doing them all is full right they're all what's that Lauren Boebert will be up later today and we're putting them up all his full right they're all going up as full interviews we may do some clips after but we just want to you know we did so many that we didn't want a bludgeon you guys with a gajillion clips so that'll all be going up and all right post-game show in just a moment cold clothes and I'll see everybody at ruminreports.locals.com goodbye you can watch the show
