    "text": " Hey! Hey! Hey! I wanna- Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Yeah, fuck up! Hey! My dad... ...is getting older. And, uh, I don't like it. He's got a lot of health issues. He's- you know, he's always had fucked up feet, but now they're like Uber fucked up. He's got like ulcers on both sides of his feet. He has to walk in like this boot, and then another thing on his other foot. Um, hopefully not for too much longer. He got a pacemaker this past year, and then they've even like that was programmed wrong, and he had to go to the emergency room, and it was weird, because they like fixed it on a computer. Anyway, science. The guy never complains, which is lovely, but also maddening, because it's impossible to know how he's doing. So, he and my stepmother Janice have one treat at the end of the night that they do every night. They eat a tootsie pop. It's like their thing. Uh, it's cute. And, uh, Janice licks it slowly until it has melted in her mouth. And, schleppy bites it, like the owl in the old timey commercial. And, uh, you know, one chomp and it's done. So, the other night, they get into bed with their tootsie pops. Dad chomps his. And four teeth came out. Four teeth. He didn't tell me this. Janice told me this two days later. So, then, you know, it's late at night. So, the next morning at 8 a.m., Janice calls his dentist, and they don't open until nine. But it says, you know, for an emergency press two or whatever. And my dad's like, don't you press the button for emergency. Emergency's only if you're in pain. I'm not in pain. You will not admit pain. He could be on his actual deathbed. And you could go, Dad, how are you? And he'll go, you know what, Sarah? I'm fucking phenomenal. Fucking phenomenal. That's how above and beyond he lies. He does complain when he's alone with Janice and then completely gaslights her when she brings it up to the sisters, my sisters and me. You know, it's masculinity. It's who knows what it is, but it's a little maddening. And so, anyway, so she doesn't press. He won't let her press the emergency thing. So, they call back at nine when the dentist is open and they have them come right in and they just glued him in. And then they would need to, with surgery, put them in proper. But he's like, the glue is fine. The glue works. I can do anything. I can eat ice glue. I can bubble ball, you know, whatever. But no, he did get them. They got his teeth put in properly and pretty such a character. He's oddly shy. You know, remember on the Hulu show, Raj? We shot like two or three hours straight with him in a pool just answering questions about life because he's not good if he's given lines. But if you just ask him questions for to answer like, ex-temporaneously, he's incredible. But you know, they kept going like, Mr. Silverwood, do you like some water? And he's like, no, I'm okay. Take the water the next day. He was in the hospital for dehydration because he's too shy to say, sure, I'll have some water. Dad's, I don't know. You can't kill him. You can't, uh, you probably could kill him. I mean, he's 84. I don't think anyone's gonna suspect foul play. You know what I wanted to talk about today is, uh, I had this idea and it's not some genius idea. By any means, it's an experiment. I want, uh, y'all to try. I've been trying it. Roar is been trying it and it's so dumb. Before I even tell it to you, I am aware of it that it's dumb. It's base. But, um, it's, it's just very simple. But hey, you know, important stuff is, uh, sometimes is, very simple. But sometimes it's just dumb. But the experiment is to, it's, it's just this. Uh, just substitute any word that is traditionally masculine. I don't know. Mankind, fireman, businessman, congressman, right hand man, may the best man win. I don't know. Best man for the job. Uh, manpower, bunch of guys. You know, we, we just, uh, for the roast, we get a bunch of guys in the room. Just any of those things that are masculine, whenever those words come up in your life, change them not to be neutral, not to be genderless, change them to the feminine, not, not genderless. I don't want to make it a word that includes everybody. I want to, um, this is an experiment in exclusion. You may say, well, how can non-binary people, uh, participate in this experiment? Non-binary people can if they want. But my point is they don't need to. They understand exclusion and inclusion better than, uh, binary gendered people possibly can. No? So what? Fireman becomes firewoman. Fire girl for all I care. Anything you want, just feminine, woman kind, bunch of women in a room writing jokes for the, uh, roast. I don't know why that's in my mind. I know why actually handy woman, business woman, congresswoman, blah, blah, blah. What's the point? Um, what am I trying to prove? I don't know. I'm not trying to prove shit. I don't know what the result is. I don't know what your result will be, but what I'm wondering is if you maybe get a sense of how it might feel to not be a man specifically, um, to only know language through a masculine lens, you know, so, so, so, we've only known language my whole life through a masculine lens to only see ourselves as, uh, an addendum to words that do not include us. And we know that when we say mankind, it means women too. That's, we were always taught that we know that when we say congressmen, it means the women in congress as well. But to never hear yourself reflected back in the words of your language, what might that be like? Might you want to know? So, uh, for my, the fellas in the audience right now, just for shits and giggles, you know, uh, you might want to try it, you know, because for women, for girls, for non-binary folk, this is how we grew up with masculine words. It's all any of us knew. We didn't know it as wrong. We just, you know, I can't speak for everyone. I didn't. I just, this is what is life. This is not a feminist experiment. It is a language experiment. Does language matter? I think it does. But we'll see. I can't wait to hear, um, hear what you think. You know, there's no answer or result that I am planning or anticipating or hoping for. I just, I wanted you to notice how it makes you feel. I'd be curious to see how many of our male friends out there are willing to do this. I asked Rory to do it. Rory, Rory. And I did it too. And I fucked up way more times than he did. It's, it's funny where I'm conditioned. We're conditioned. Language conditions us. But Rory was having a lot of fun with it. He's like, go, woman, Pierce was great in mayor of Easttown. All right. Pros, baby. Oh my gosh. I just started using shampoo and conditioner by pros and it's so good. I had the shampoo and conditioner, which is they're both very moisturizing because my hair is dry as fuck. And then it's got like its own, um, number that is specifically mine and it says for Sarah on it. It's a blend, just, you know, an ingredients blend made just for my hair. And it makes me feel oh, so special. Just like you. There is no one size fits all solution when it comes to hair care. A product that works wonders for curls might make straight hair limp and greasy. Thanks to my personalized pros routine, I can honestly say I've never been more in love with my hair. Oh, look, I'm even wearing it down today. Ooh, look at Sarah. She has her hair down. It's real hair. First pros starts by asking about you as a person with their in-depth consultation. Pros asked me really unexpected things like what kinds of foods I eat or where I work out. Next, pros analyzed all my answers and determined what unique blend of ingredients should be in every product of my custom routine. I have very dry hair, so I'm sure there's a common thread there. Pros makes custom hair care that's effective because it's personal. Using natural ingredients with proven results, pros customizes every product in your routine from shampoo to supplements. All their ingredients are sustainably sourced, ethically gathered and cruelty free. They're also the first custom beauty brand to go carbon neutral. Pros is the healthy hair regimen with your name all over it. Take your free in-depth hair consultation and get 15% off your first order today. Go to pros.com slash Sarah.

Then before that, I was on something called Yazz. Anyway, I've been on the birth control pill for 22 years and I have been off it for two weeks now. Starting to feel it because, you know, it's, uh, I'm in a totally new place in my life, my hormones, my age, my all that shit. 22 years ago, I was in a completely different place. So, now my body is readjusting and then it's going to readjust again because it's getting off the pill. And then it's like, what's this? What happened while I was gone? So, I feel a little bit hormonally, uh, kind of like a ticking time bomb, you know, I just, uh, I've been mostly pretty even, uh, but, you know, I did notice this weekend, you know, like Saturday I woke up, uh, with a familiar old friend called Depression, a little, little, little downward spiral Saturday morning. Uh, and then yesterday I woke up with just, woke up with anxiety. And this is not like me. Um, this, I used to be like this. And now I am again a little bit, but I'm working on it. I'm monitoring it. I'm trying to, I, you know, I'm, I'm getting a, I'm making a appointment with a psychiatrist, but I'm also working with the nature path, nature path, nature path, no one knows how to say it. I don't know how to say it. Maybe I should say, uh, and she's been helping me with, uh, vitamins and, uh, herbs and stuff that are supposed to help. Um, but I'm trying to go a little longer without any changes to just kind of, um, see more evidence, you know, notice more patterns. It's very hard. You have to have a real like mind, body connection. You know, when you like your backaches or your something aches and you're like, ah, and then someone goes like, where is it? And you're like, where is it? You know, you're trying to, you don't know, you know, it's very hard to have that mind, body connection. I mean, of course we have one. I mean, how else would you explain nervous diarrhea? But it's sometimes hard to decipher, get specific about, and you want to communicate to the people who are helping you exactly what's going on so that they can help you. But yeah, Saturday, uh, I woke up just right away just thinking, what's the point? Nothing matters. And I knew I had a show that night and I was like, why do I perform? What's the purpose? What is this? This is, there's no point. Nothing matters. Nothing matters. All these, you know, it just was like a mantra in my head. Nothing fucking matters. This is all a fraudulent illusion. Nothing matters. And I intellectually could go, all right, this is, I'm in a bad place and I'm in a dark place and I know that I come out of it, you know, but sometimes intellectually is, you know, isn't, uh, you can reason and reason and reason and it's, it's hard to go like, right, okay, I mean, there would be times PMS where I'd be bananas and then go, oh God, it's my PMS week and just knowing that would help me a lot. Like I'd already feel better just going like, okay, I'm not going crazy. I just, this is hormonal, but I don't have quite a beat on, on, um, on this yet. But, uh, you know, I got through Saturday. I let myself wallow and be negative and then I had a show to do and I just went through the motions. I put on my, you know, I took a bath. I put on my tinted moisturizer, uh, listen to old sets on my phone to kind of just prep and just do proactive things passively, you know, and, um, and by the time I got in my car to go to the, the show, I was, um, to go to Largo, Largo. Um, I was really feeling better and I was like, ah, who gives a shit? Just have fun. Nothing matters. And I was like, oh, isn't that interesting that I sunk into depression because I felt like nothing matters and it ended up being the same thing that snapped me out of it. Right. Nothing matters. Just have fun. You know, what a wacky mantra that gets me, uh, both in and out of depression. So that's, uh, that was my weekend and, uh, let's take some calls. Hi, Sarah. I love your podcast and I love the way you think about things and understand things and describe things. So I've been wondering what you think about plastic surgery, particularly pertaining to celebrities and particularly in the sense that something that often happens is usually a woman, but somebody will get plastic surgery and then all of these people start freaking out and commenting about it. Like, what happened to her face? Oh my gosh, why would she do this? And A, I totally understand why people have that reaction because it's weird when somebody totally alters their face. And I always feel like it sort of shows insecurity and wanting to like stay young looking. And I get why people get mad about people's reactions about it because especially as women, like we should be able to do whatever we want to our bodies and that's the whole thing. But then I get annoyed that people are all judging people who have a reaction and I'm just curious your thoughts about this and about sort of the the PC police not wanting people to comment or being mad at each other about people's reactions to celebrities having plastic surgery. So just curious because I like the way that you Oh, I guess that's it. I think you get cut off after a certain amount of time. Uh, I agree in that I'm wishy washy about it. I mean, listen, it's like if we're saying now, Hey, if you're assigned if you're assigned sex at birth is female, but you are male, we want to be supportive of you getting that surgery so that your outside matches your inside. Yes. So if if if you're born with a nose that is not your nose, I mean, I did not have a nose. I'm one of I actually did not have a nose job. Although I when I used to say that I had a perfect nose, but the nose does continue to grow and in my case, the nostrils. But, um, if you if you are born and you say, this is not my nose. I just don't feel like me. Or whatever the chin or whatever. Maybe we should be supportive of that too because isn't that the same thing as I mean, isn't that somehow in, you know, at least mildly analogous to, you know, being born with the, you know, being assigned a sex at birth that is not who you are. I don't know. Just a thought. I mean, listen, when I was, um, young, younger, I would say you shouldn't touch your faces. This is the face God gave you. I would never do anything, you know, but then you go like, uh, didn't you have braces when you were 10 or, you know, like, uh, didn't you have cosmetic braces to fix your teeth? I actually did not have perfect teeth, but that's a gift from Hashem. But, you know, a lot of kids have braces and, and where, uh, retainers and, uh, you know, they, they, that's, is not cosmetic often. Do we not support that? I don't know. But on the other hand, I do understand it's like, you know, first of all, getting older is, is I want to embrace it. And in a lot of ways, I love it. I love what I know now. I love how all the things I worried about when I was younger don't matter and realizing that. Uh, but getting older is odd. Your face is always changing. You know, like I had a very horse face. And now I am noticing in my mind anyway, and this isn't an insult to me, but I'm finding it to be less horsey and more chipmunkish. But, um, oh, yeah, it's more chipmunky. I don't know. The change I'm seeing is very chipmunky. Your face changes. Your nose grows, your ears grows. Aging is not for sissies as Betty Davis once said. But, uh, you know, I was thinking about we go like, if you're a girl in a boy's body or vice versa, you should be able to get that corrected. If you want your outside to, to reflect your inside, you know, and I'm not going to lie. I have definitely participated in the, uh, did you see what she did to her face? You know, like, what'd she do to her face? I mean, I lived in an apartment for years, an apartment building that had mostly like elderly people that were rich. Like the word, this is their like apartment in town. And, uh, I was always, uh, mesmerized by their faces. They looked crazy to me, but I kept thinking, does this look good to them? You know, will this look good to me when I'm older? Is this like, or is this some kind of like sign of wealth, like, uh, like, you know, ancient Chinese nobility would like grow their fingernails and like curly cues to show that they don't need to work? You know, I mean, that didn't look good either, but it was like, you know, I'm not into that stuff, that showy stuff anyway, but you know, I don't know. It's, it's so hard, especially for women, especially for women in show business, because you are fucking spanked for aging. You are hissed about if then you try to do something about it. The stigma of aging is just bananas, at least here in the United States. I guess it's, it's like everything. It ultimately comes down to getting your self worth from inside and not from outside forces, but fuck, I get it. I mean, I can feel my face slowly sliding off of my skull and it's not awesome. I am sometimes bummed when I look in the mirror and I see a, my wavy jawline. I liked when my jawline was tight. I, I suddenly now completely understand the title of Nora Ephron's book, I Hate My Neck. That said, my body works and I'm strong and I'm very, very, very grateful to be healthy, strong, my body works. And fuck it, like I'm lumpy all over. I've become like real oatmealy in the body. And yet when I am naked, Rory gets a raging boner and isn't that what it's all about? I, you know, the whole idea about like, I'm open to getting like lasers and I get that a microdermabrasion, which is like a, when you scrub your face with polish, but they do it like super duper. I'll get that every couple months or something. But it's, you know, mostly those laser things and those treatments are what they are, are they're wounding you. They're, they're wounding like the second layer of your skin or something so that your body heals. And when your body heals, it's, it generates like new skin or like new collagen or I don't know, I don't know the technicals of it. I'm not a scientist, but it just, it scares me a little bit. The idea of wounding yourself. But yeah, I don't know. All boils down to what my shrink said so long ago. Look in the mirror less. I'm Maya. I'm 15 and I'm from New Hampshire. I recently started listening to your podcast. My parents have been listening to your what, for a while now because we're all pretty huge fans of you and I just have a quick question regarding high school and kind of your thoughts on it. So I obviously can't vote, but if I could, I would consider myself a liberal and you know, a lot of the kids in my school are not. And do you think it's crazy for me or for anyone to not date someone because of their political views and ideologies? Or do you think that, you know, since we're in high school, it will change over time because I definitely see myself, you know, distancing myself from people or not being attracted to people because of their political views? Yeah, especially since we're wearing masks down school, if someone doesn't wear it incorrectly, I kind of prejudge them. Maybe that's just me, but yeah, thank you. Hi Maya. I'm so excited you're calling from New Hampshire. I was a 15 year old girl in New Hampshire. I just burped inside my throat. I hope you couldn't hear that. But either way, now you know, it wasn't like, but like, if my mic was near my throat, you could definitely hear like, okay, sorry, let's focus. I think that if you're drawn to somebody, whatever their or their family's beliefs, that's fine. You don't have to judge it. You know, it could even be beautiful, especially if they love and respect you because or despite of what you believe. I don't think you should feel pressured to snub your nose at someone who is from a conservative family or who's conservative. I mean, if he or she or they are a Trump head and it turns you off, then of course not. I would go with your gut. You know, your gut tells you how you feel and and love is about feelings. But sometimes those ingredients that make a person turns you off or turns you on or you know, and you can listen to that. Your gut is never going to lie to you. I also, as you know, grew up in New Hampshire and most of my friends were from conservative families and and had conservative were conservative. And I'm still close with some of them. My best friends growing up were twins from a very religious family. And I still hear from not just from them, but from their mom. She she sends me a card every year for Hanukkah, which is how I know when Hanukkah is. And we're so different. But you know what? She loves me anyway. And they love me anyway. And I love them. I'm a lot older than you. And I remember when I was eight, my friends going, Oh, we love Ronald Reagan. He's so handsome. And I thought, Oh, yuck. But they didn't know why they liked them just like I didn't know why I didn't like them. We were still very much reflections of our parents. And that may be true for you. And that may be true for him or her or them others. Um, or maybe not. But you're in a clear 15, you know, and your your view is going to change and grow hopefully. And bottom line, you should date whoever you like. That's all. Just go with your gut and see who appeals to you. And if you're drawn to that person, you should and they're drawn to you, go ahead and date them. You know, go with your gut. Love is an intellectual. It's feelings. I hope that helped when I'm happy to hear from you. I love hearing from from from kids and teens and in the future, our future people, our future adults. All right. Good luck. What else? So my boyfriend and I were having a really bad day yesterday. And I started talking about the interview that you gave with Katie Couric, where you described how your dog looked when he got stoned and the way you made during the interview. And so I brought it up on YouTube because it's still there. And it made us laugh so fucking hard. And it was the best thing to put us in a better mood, just you talking about your stone dog and the perfect face that you made. So just wanted to let you know, from Portland, Oregon, you really helped. Thanks. That's funny. The story is I was well, Jimmy and I was with Jimmy Kimmel at the time and we went to New York for a lot, a amount of time. Like we got, we subled at an apartment. I can't remember why we were there. And I brought my dog duck. And of course I made pot run used to bring with us. And one day I came home and duck was just shaking and staring. And at first I thought, Oh, he's cold and I bundled him up. And then I was like, what's going on with him? It was kind of scary. And I look on the coffee table and the zip lock bag that had six pot brownies in them was chewed out from the side and he had eaten all of them. And the second I saw that I just scooped him up, gotten a cab and went straight to the animal hospital. And I remember the doctor looking at duck and just laughing. And I was like, what? He goes, this little guy is tripping. So they kept him overnight and they just pumped saline. And for a while I was in the, I had to be in the waiting room. And it was awful because there were like two different families who were putting their dog, their elderly dog's asleep and just sobbing. And I was holding this little stone dog whose mouth was so dry. I had to like spit on my finger and put it kind of spread it on his gums because he's like, you never think of dogs with lips, but his like top lip was stuck. I'll show you it was like this. So I had to keep it moist with my my own saliva. So they kept him overnight and they pumped water and saline through him. And the next day he was okay. And I, um, they had me pick him up. And then I picked him up and we walked outside and he shit, a shit the size of his entire body. I've never seen anything like it. It was like, it was very cleansing it, I think for both of us. But I will say that after that event, and I'm not suggesting you do this because it was very scary. But after that, for many years, very chill, he became a very chill dog. Could bring him anywhere, put him anywhere, plop him anywhere. He was fine. And he lived to be 19 though. I should have put him to sleep when he was more like 17. He was, you know, really just a shell of a dog. But I, you know, selfishly, I kept him alive too long. All right, what else? Hi, Sarah. My name is Betty. I live in El Paso, Texas. We're right across from Juarez, Mexico. And so our whole community is Mexican and Spanish speaking and Catholic. And I just remember in the fifth grade at school, we watched the diary of Anne Frank. And I had never met a Jewish person. And even till this day, I don't think I've met any from here in El Paso. And so as a child watching that, I was so shocked and sad. And I really thought that the Holocaust had gotten rid of all of the Jews. And like, there was just a few left. Most of them. So it wasn't until later when I watched the nanny on Nick and Knight, that I learned so much and that I did my research on the culture and on the religion. And it taught me so much. I learned that there are so many Jews in the world. And I learned about Hanukkah and Hathover. And I just wanted to know what you thought of the show. Because even watching it now on HBO Max, I just love it so much. And I even love the words they use. They use so many Jewish words, like a Schmagagie and a Machugena. And I don't know if the rest of the cast was Jewish. I know Fran Drescher was Jewish. But is it OK for me to be saying those words, even though I'm not Jewish because they're just saying. Thanks. My face hurts from smiling. Betty. Oh my God, she's so delicious. I just want to squeeze her. I love that her exposure to Judaism as the nanny. No, the other characters were not Jewish. I think it was a fish out of water sitcom that one. They're all aristocratic British people. My Rabbi, sister Susie also loves the nanny. It's her favorite. Yeah, well, it turns out the nanny is good for the Jews. To me, I think Adam Sandler is one of the greatest things for the Jews in America. Just him being, first of all, the Hanukkah song, obviously, and saying all the people that are Jewish that you wouldn't know. But just him being so cool and so funny and outwardly, openly Jewish, I'm sure helps Jewish kids immensely growing up just by being cool and openly Jewish. No, not all the Jews were wiped out after the Holocaust, but most were. There are not a lot of Jews. Jews are one-fifth of one percent of the world. But they're mostly in New York and LA and Israel. And I know some Texas Jews. I know some like Houston Jews. I think there's an area in Chicago that's very Jewish as well. There's always little nooks. I love you. I think it's absolutely great that you love using Yiddish. Yiddish is such a cool language. I only know the words I grew up with. But you also like, what's cool about it is there's no wrong way to spell anything because it's just all phonetic. It's just all words that don't come from roots of things. Like at my dad spelled mench the most ridiculous way. And I was like, dad. And he's like, it's not wrong. Can spell it anyway, it sounds to your ear. To your ear. But I think Jews love it when non-Jews embrace, you know, say, Michigoss or, you know, Oi. I love it because it feels like love. I hope someday to meet you and be your first Jew. It's like when we were at Raj and I worked on the Hulu show. I love you, America. And we went to the city, Shalmet, Louisiana. And I spent the day and the evening with this family. And they had never met a Jew before. And brandy, the matriarch, the 27-year-old matriarch who I love, Googled Jew before I came. She Googled Jew. And then when I came, she was telling me about it. And she goes, did you know Adam Levine is one? He said, no, I did know that. Yeah, any earnest interest in Jews is super welcome. Yes. Nothing better than hearing my non-Jewish friends regularly saying, enlisting the word Oi. So say, Oi, say, Michigoss, eat a bagel. I hereby make you an honorary Jew, Betty, Betty the Jew. You don't even have to believe in God. That's what's great about Judaism. It's a culture. It's a ethnicity. It's a religion. It's a race. It's a dessert topping. It's a floor wax. I know I've said that before. I don't know why whenever I think of how many forms being Jewish can take. I think of that old Saturday Night Live sketch. Other people think shapeshifter. Devil Rat's vermin. I think dessert topping and floor wax. Dad, Donald, Donnie Schleppie. I'm winding down. This is the show. It happened. And now it's ending. And this is the time where I say subscribe, rate, and review wherever you listen to podcasts. Now you hear that and you just your brain skips over because you're so used to hearing it at the end of a podcast. Please really do it. You just click the button. Click the button that says subscribe. That really, really helps us out. And it's nothing to you, which is the button you click, but it really helps podcasts stay on the air. And if you like watching with your eye holes, watch us on YouTube. Bye. That's because we know the first thing your tongue touches when you take a bite is the bottom. So try the new crispy parm pizza from Papa John. It's living awesome."
