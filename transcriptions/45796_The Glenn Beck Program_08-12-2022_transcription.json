We get into the Brittany Griner trade Here what a what an incredible effort here by our president. There's so many problems with it We are of course happy that Brittany Griner is coming home as a US citizen But there's lots of problems we get into those today the American Girl doll company For promoting a new book which encourages children to acquire puberty blockers if they feel uncomfortable in their own bodies Well, you want it you want that's where you go. Yeah, you got to go to the dog company whenever I have a concern about a medical issue I go right to American Girl dolls. It's incredible. Yeah, it really is We also learned there were no women leads in action movies before Hunger Games Which I didn't know I there's some other examples, but apparently those weren't real Don't forget to subscribe to this podcast as well as Stoode's America available every day and Pat grand leash Similarly available every single day.

Here's a podcast You'll miss me too It's been super Glenn who is still a little bit under the weather The breaking news on Brittany griner. She's been released now. Yeah, she's coming home. Yep coming home be home for Christmas Exchange her for the merchant of death It's just so good isn't it great. It's so good. I mean could you possibly we've we've traded the merchant of death For a WNBA player mm-hmm, which makes now look first off I'm I want Brittany griner back in the United States. There's no doubt about it many times many times I want her back. Yes, I'm glad she's coming home. That is a good part of the story And I'm glad even though she was I don't know in favor of the kneeling or whatever it was. Yeah, I don't care Okay, what are your home? She's an American American citizen. She like I don't know we don't know the truth Whether she was guilty or not, but there's a good chance. She wasn't Guilty if she may have been guilty There but either regardless the punishment does not fit the crime not at all and obviously the Russians were holding her as a chip To hurt us as this is going on so we understand that and I'm glad she's coming home There's the reason why I don't think it's worth focusing on that Entirely is because everybody agrees on it Everybody wants Brittany griner to be here instead of in a Russian, you know death camp somewhere in Siberia So we all get that obviously there was a priority and they should have been negotiating for her release sure The next part of that pat is the merchant of death. Yeah, okay. Yeah now the merchant of death is He's an arms dealer and the reason I know a good amount about the merchant of death And I will say there's a there's a chance some of the stuff I know about the merchant of death is false and the reason for that is because Lord of War is one of my favorite movies It's a Nicholas Cage movie. It's an obscure Nicholas Cage movie and I love it. It's a great Great movie if you've never seen it now, of course, it's got all sorts of liberal messaging throughout. It's a very anti gun It's very anti war blah blah blah blah, but it's a great freaking movie and it's the story of this guy Mmm now they name him something else because they want to take a little liberty with the story. It's it's based on him It's based on a true story But this guy was an he was kind of a low-level guy what up trying to be an arms dealer rose up the ranks of this illicit arms dealer world and One of his big innovations in this in this moment was at the fall of the Soviet Union He kind of took advantage of the chaos he went in and negotiated with some of his used Ukrainian and belief and some of his relatives and People he knew that were had high ranking military positions in the old Soviet army Soviet Union falls They're now there with giant stockpiles of weapons The record keeping is not there anymore. There's no oversight anymore from the Soviets. It's it's over. It's dissolving so he comes in and buys tons and tons of weapons pennies on the dollar and then resells them to like African Civil Wars and he just rakes in the cash and He goes through you know a period where? his brother is involved and he you know dies and and has a huge drug problem and he get then this guy gets a The merchant of death gets a big drug problem going Mary's a supermodel goes through that I mean, it's an incredible story really is worthy of a movie. Yes, even a Nicolas Cage movie it's worthy of a Nicolas Cage movie and This guy Did all sorts of things. I mean he was responsible For God only knows how many deaths he was funny, you know The Liberian Civil War was one of his big big targets This is back when Charles Taylor was in charge there and was absolutely brutal and He would funnel weapons to these wars sometimes both sides of the war just to sell More and more weapons and enrich himself this is a guy who you know Probably now is loved in Russia because he really you know emptied the coffers of the Ukrainian army Stella a bunch of stuff of his own down in in other parts of the world He was almost caught a million times eventually was caught in in I think it was in New York and Was put into prison and should remain there forever That's how this story should end instead. He's on a flight back to Russia and We're getting a Solid center with good post-up abilities. So I don't know it's a weird trade. It is. Yeah, it is a weird trade Look I'm a happy. I'm happy that Brittany grinders But then there's another layer of this pat which is look Do I want Brittany Grindr back? We've already answered that question. Yes, I do. I don't care about her WNBA career at all I don't I don't know much about her. I don't care that she's in the WNBA I don't care about the WNBA But she's an American citizen. I would like her back however Paul Wayland's also an American citizen and he's been over there for decades yeah and For some reason we got Brittany Grindr out, but not him Now you might say we only had a one-for-one trade and that might be the answer to this but like I know from a chivalry standpoint I can make an argument okay, even though he's had a much longer road in Russian detention Mm-hmm. We still go with we go with a woman for chivalry reasons I you can talk to me about that, but Joe Biden can't make that argument He can't even tell what a woman is that this entire side of our political spectrum can't define what a woman even is So you can't make the chivalry argument here if you can't make that argument What argument is there to bring Brittany Grindr back instead of Paul Wayland? What what argument is there? She had CBD and he's accused of being a spy Well, I mean maybe that maybe maybe that maybe that's true, but I mean they have already I don't buy that First of all, he's not a spy right should be clear But he's definitely not a spy that's total BS from Russia But you know you can understand that from a Russian perspective Yeah, rather release her and maybe that's maybe that's part of it. I don't They've already indicated that they would negotiate on this point in back channels at least there's been a lot of reporting on that and so and really you could exchange a spy for a spy too We've got people in who are held here that we believe were Russian spies and they probably were Yeah, but Exchange for this guy being total favor of a prisoner exchange in that eventuality for for Paul Wayland. Yeah, yeah Just a one-for-one exchange spy for spy sure I mean well It's that it's ridiculous to say this because he's not a spy not but that but I you know again I you sort of understand that and I I am I really wonder the American citizens that are in in captivity over there back Like it's a high priority. We should be focusing on it. We should have people on it We you know the same thing happened in North Korea. We saw activity there with the Trump administration I mean he focused on this a lot this type of and he you know also tried to get several captives back from Russia It's good to see that this is happening, but it just it there and maybe I'm being you maybe you're pushing back here Pat and I'm being too skeptical on this maybe Maybe I'm wrong, but like doesn't it feel like the only reason Brittany Griner is coming back instead of Paul Wayland is that she's famous But it does it does am I am I too cynical on this? No, I thought I think that's probably accurate It's got a lot more publicity right no one else who called me Lin is right He's been sitting over there for a million years and only his parents seem to care about it Mm-hmm, and they've been trying to go to the media forever And every once in a while you see a profile story and the story goes away Brittany Griner is somebody that is in you know it has some level of public profile and I I don't know I mean it just seems like this is just a play by the Biden administration to bring back a celebrity Which again, I'm happy she's coming back, but like it does not seem Like this is a pure Decision and I'm just I'm looking here. I couldn't remember when he was incarcerated. It was 2020 So he's been he's been over there for about two and a half years Okay in jail for two and a half years. I may have got him confused with sentenced though to 16 So she was sentenced to what 10 yeah nine or 10 this indicates that they don't even believe he's a spy right the Russian government It's not if he thought he was a spy they wouldn't sentence him to 16 years at Brittany Griner 10 For right like come on. Yeah, we all know that that's that's ridiculous They don't even believe he's a spy and they know the look these people are chips They're negotiating chips for the Russians and that's almost always the case in these situations and I don't believe and I Frankly don't necessarily you know believe that Brittany Griner even did anything wrong I mean, I think there's a good chance. She didn't now. There's a chance that she did obviously like We don't think of it wasn't even CBD was supposedly Something elevated from that. I believe was the accusation it was you know the it was I think The argument was at the time that she was using it like you know how you'd use medical marijuana for For pain management, you know like that was the argument at the time now. God only knows what's right and what's wrong here You know, she'll come back and she'll tell oh, how she's right now. There we go. Yeah So you know, it's a that probably is a crime there what she actually doing it It's possible right. I mean she might look at this and be like, yeah, no one's gonna do anything to me in the United States for this It's not gonna be a big deal And you know what are the Russians gonna throw out one of these big athletes and put me in prison Maybe she made that calculation and it but like once the war heats up like that calculations out the window I mean it should have been out the window at the beginning, but it really makes no sense once the war you know Battles and and and and the buildup to the war starts obviously they wanted revenge on us And I think that's Quite clear what was going on here Especially when you come to the the punishment angle of it, right? Like it's one thing to get in trouble for a crime in a foreign country. This does happen to people But they did they didn't exactly go light on Like a Russian prison camp 10 years You know, it seems a little over the top a little bit Yeah, and that's why there was outrage over it and there should be and there should have been But uh it did take him took him a long time to get her out I mean That she should have been out if the if trump were in office I think she would have been out. Well she might not have even been arrested frankly But if she were I'll bet she would have been out in a week Yeah Instead of eight or nine months or whatever it's been that's probably true I do think he you know, he would have he would have focused on it. He also had a A different relationship with them. All right. I mean that would have been interesting to see what happened in that case because obviously The trump's russia policy was much much harsher on russia than obama's policy was on russia By far, but I mean it wasn't even close He he said things that were nice about poutine from time to time And everyone's like oh well. He just loves flat of your poutine and then you look at his policy You're like wait a minute. It doesn't seem like he likes vatte mr. Putin that much There never seemed to be much Love policy. Well, he was not soft on russia. No at all The reverse of that. He I mean he reversed soft russia policies that obama had put into place Yeah, you know and I I mean I I guess the I guess the left wing argument to that is well Those are just the people around him. You know, you had people like john bolton around him who were obviously more hawkish And you know, so maybe that was it the he just agreed to whatever went around him was telling him But I don't know I I think that's that's what everyone likes to do with donald trump when it's a policy that they like they just say Oh, well all the people around him are doing it and when it's a policy They don't like then it's him by himself doing all making all the decisions That's just how this works with donald trump. He deserves credit for his his russia policy was he does harsh It does and he was actually holding red lines unlike the previous administration It would have been interesting to see what does this war even happen If trump is in office. Yeah, my guess is no, I guess it's no This is the best of the glenbeck program Okay, so uh the popular doll maker american girl Has some advice for your kids. They've got a guidebook that they put together. This is great Yeah, it's great and it's only 13 bucks. Well, it's it's 1299 Okay, so it's not as expensive as I was leading on It's only 1299 and it has some great advice for children struggling with body image issues And it suggests they ask their doctors for puberty blocking medication And to seek transgender support without parental consent if you don't have an adult you can trust in your life What on earth don't you get all your really serious life advice from doll manufacturers from doll companies most of it most of it Most of my stuff comes from you know when I really have a hard issue It's usually american girl doll manufacturers. Yeah when I was concerned about compounding interest I went to a sex doll company. Oh, you did. Yeah, I was like, what what should I do? Uh with my mortgage right now. Yeah, what's going on with that? What was their advice? Their advice was uh, oh, I can't say their advice It was it was x-ray They swore at me a bunch of times. Yeah, that was weird. But anyway, that's that is always where I go Well, uh american girl has put out a smalt a smart girl's guide body image book And uh, it's on the website again for just 1299 Uh, you know if you're struggling, uh your kids are struggling. This is right where you go The cover of the 96 page. It's a 96 page paperback Wow, it shows four girls of varying body weights and skin colors ones in a wheelchair another has Blue dyed hair and the subtitle reads how to love yourself Live life to the fullest and celebrate all kinds of bodies You know and then and then tells you if you're struggling if you're not comfortable with the part of your body Then you know you should go get some some puberty blockers From your doctor and that way, you know, you'll have a couple of years to decide whether you're comfortable with your body Or if you want to change it, you know through surgery I can't believe this it's unbelievable. I mean american girl dolls We bought all of our girls american girl dolls. They loved them and now They're doing this with our kids. I got so this is interesting pat because Uh, I have small kids. Yeah, younger kids and uh, they my daughters has a fan of a big fan girl has You know tons of stuff. Yeah, I meant to for presents and stuff She's bought with her own money like, you know, she got she she's even got the jeep pat She is the inside. I didn't know there was a girl. There's a great jeep great You want to get the jeep fantastic is it one that it's big enough for her to write in it? Um, yeah, uh, no She's not that big for the adult american girl. Yes. Okay. All right. So not but so then that's a very standard experience I will say as your kids get older Uh, you have to talk to them about some things that are going on in their lives Right, some changes that may be coming up soon Right not like gendered transition changes, but just the change that every boy or girl The normal changes. Yeah, that they all go through and um, if you are a parent You know that that can be a little strange and sure and challenging. Yeah, and so what do you do in that situation? This is unbelievable You go and you look for resources right to kind of help you walk through it Maybe a book that you can read to your kids. So I went through uh a bunch of like Conservative reviews of these types of books because I was worried about You know what woke nonsense they would slip into these things right? And uh when I went through this one of the ones recommended by all sorts of conservatives uh religious people All sorts were the american girl doll series Oh, you gotta be kidding me of all sorts of books like this Not just about jet, you know, not about gender transition at all, but just like okay puberty Right like you're getting older like these are these types of things You're gonna get you know hair under your arms, right? Like it's stuff like that Yeah, just kind of Let people the kids know what's going on And so I read these the books from this company About the the basics. Yeah, and they don't have any sign Of this kind of stuff in there. So this has got to be new I mean this is not a book that I saw the body image one how to love yourself life to the close It says it's a newly released book So they're they're going down this road tan and older And uh, it says parts of your body may make you feel uncomfortable And you may want to change the way you look. What is it? Wait stop for a second totally okay For stop for a second. Mm-hmm. That is totally okay Every single person on earth has has parts of their body that make them uncomfortable You know, I could tell you my gut is one of them Yeah, I got to reveal the transition. I would like to transition into a thin person So that doesn't seem to be happening, but I would like it. Yeah, so And what was the second part of that that uh, you should be comfortable in your body You know, yeah, it's totally okay if you're uncomfortable. Yeah, and you want to change the way you look. That's fine Yes, it's okay if you want to change the way you look. Yeah, it's so funny because when When you are overweight and you want to lose weight, they say actually fat pride You should eat every everyone is perfect Everyone is perfect and that's okay. No matter how you are you were made that way You were born that way and you're perfect as you never want to change No, I was not born. I was not born fat. That is not true. No, I ate to get that way 8 pound seven ounces. I transitioned into a fat person. I have really let myself go since there I am way more than 8 pound seven ounces. Yeah. Oh my gosh. I was gonna say way more. It looked like you put on a few sometimes You know, it's birth. Yeah, I have you really have so but like that is This is they're taking advantage of a really normal human instinct to say you know, I'd like to look a little bit better Gosh. I if I hate the way I look in this way everyone goes through that Yeah, you should be able to Take that rationally and in context and maybe make some changes that would make you more healthy Not cut off your parts because you don't like them right That's a different pitch or stop taking or start taking life altering Medication that can stop the natural process of your body I mean, that's really dangerous and Doctors who are honest are starting to really speak out about that fortunately that hey, uh, it's not necessarily Just this just delays things for a while and then you're gonna be fine if you stop taking them Uh, it could cause real problems for you But they continue in another part of the book You could appreciate your body for everything it allows you to experience and still want to change certain things about it If you haven't gone through puberty yet, the doctor might offer medication to delay your bodies changes giving you more time to think about your gender identity Uh, this is a what the hell doll company Yeah, and I guess like it is important. Yes, it's a doll company But like they're bringing in experts in these fields to write these books I'm sure yeah, this is actually a part of their company so bad And you know a lot of the stuff that they have is totally I think would be cool with yeah, you liked it. It was fine And I it was what I liked about it is it didn't get into a lot of those like Advanced questions. It was like, okay. Here's how the body changes as you get older Hey, make sure you put on deodorant kid, you know, so you could you're gonna start stinking really soon It was stuff like that. Wow, which is you know helpful for for parents to bring them through And that's what's I think scary about this and I think this is maybe the scariest part If you don't have an adult you trust Like your your parents right guess who probably bought you this book. Uh-huh There are there are organizations across the country that can help you turn to the resources on page 95 for more information I don't I don't know what resources are on page 95. It's absolutely unbelievable It's incredible to me here I have some so this is also some some other stuff from from the book The way you show your gender to the world through clothes and behavior is your gender expression No, it's not Can we uh is that forget even how ridiculous it is to try to change your gender That is not a description of what gender is the way you wear your clothes. No way wear clothes is your style That's what that is that we have words for these things already It's not has nothing to do with gender How bizarre is that that your genitalia has nothing to do with your gender, but your clothes do yeah Like you you can't tell anything about the gender of a child from whether they've got a hoo-ha Or um, what's the other one you use? Man unit a man unit a man unit or a hoo-ha. You can't tell However, you can tell if this is a quote from the book your gender expression can be feminine masculine or somewhere in between and might change Maybe you'll experiment with bright dresses And long feminine hairstyles or you might try baggy shorts plaid shirts and a buzzed haircut Your gender expression should make you feel at home in your body Wait Is that you don't have a choice whether you to be at home in your body or not even if you alter it with surgery You're still at home in your body Being at home in your body is a made-up concern It's not a thing That you like it if you have a problem being at home in your body you have something that has traditionally been called gender dysphoria where you're having problems uh medical problems Trying to understand what why you feel strange in your own body, but that's not real Your feelings are not real You might think because you put on cargo shorts, you're a boy. You're not I'm sorry like I I there is no reason to indulge in this nonsense. It is There are interesting things to be learned about an individual About the choices they might wear make in the clothes that they wear or the way that they act or the way they present themselves or the hairstyle They choose you might understand interesting parts about their personality, but there is very little societal value in in this pursuit What what does it matter? Why? Why do we care and when we were doing the patents do show back in the day pat? I remember we used to play a clip from Ellen DeGeneres And you know she's a very famous obviously lgbt I don't want to say qqia because I don't know if she she advocates for those things. I don't know But she was an lgbt Advocate for many many years obviously someone who really broke a lot of barriers to people in in the mainstream culture And they asked her about the transgender thing and she was trying to get let people who just couldn't grasp it understand what it was And what she said in her description of the transgender thing was that gender being a transgender person gender is Is a feeling that you feel in your brain? It's the way you feel And like that might be interesting if your sister's going through that it might be interesting to try to understand how they feel in their brain But when we're talking about When you go into a hospital and you need to find out if you have ovaries or not none of that matters Your feelings don't concern anyone. They're not important Full stop They are not important. They're not important when it comes to that It might be interesting to try to understand them from a physician's standpoint It might be interesting from a cultural standpoint and a societal standpoint. You might say wow, that's an interesting quirk Why does that happen? What does it mean? But it does not have value when it comes to policy It does not have value there at all That what is it what is important is whether it's a man or a woman a boy or a girl male or female That is what is important. That's what needs to be on government forms How you feel in your brain does not need to be on a government form And it certainly does not need to be explained to a 10 year old Who is already so confused by the freaking chinese communist party through tick tock That they're trying to do this stuff and trying to justify keeping it away from their parents It's really bad. It is really bad The best of the bled back program Pat and stufa glen on the bled back program actress jennifer lorence She says some stupid things Yeah, she's not from tardis bulb not not bright and you know incredibly progressive liberal Uh, but this is a weird comment Uh sort of demeaning All of the women who've done action movies that came before her she just said I remember when I was doing hunger games Nobody had ever put a woman in the lead of an action movie because it wouldn't work Would not work never no one thought about it. Yeah, no one had ever thought about it I don't think until Jennifer lorence of course in 2012 with hunger games We were told girls and boys can both identify with a male lead but boys cannot identify with a female lead Viola davis who's doing the interview of her reply replies. Oh, absolutely. Mm. Good good good pushback there. Yeah, you know Oh, we do have it. I listen to it. Let's see that In here it I remember when I was doing hunger games Nobody had ever put a woman in the lead of an action movie because it wouldn't work We were told girls and boys can both identify with a male lead But boys cannot identify with a female lead. Oh, absolutely and it just Makes me so happy every single time. I'm so happy Come out that just blows through every single one of those beliefs. Wow. Yeah, it's just not it might have been a belief But it was dumb. It wasn't true. It's a bad belief Well, it's angeline did joleen think about this. I know I'd like to know there's a bunch of movies Lots where she was the lead One was tomb raider. Yeah, that came well before 2012 another was um, uh, mr And mrs. smith. Yeah, I mean that was a coat, you know more of a it was a brad pit and her kind of she was a starring thing Yeah, but she was green in that dual leads. Yeah, she was a badass in that. Yeah, I mean she was at a bunch I mean angeline joleen has a ton of them. I mean, she's not the only one obviously Let's let's try segurney weaver perhaps in aliens 1979 is that before 2012 or I don't know we have to do the math on it. Okay. Yeah, I think it might be I think there's a chance There's a possibility it was before 2012 uh mila jovavjovjevich Uh who starred in six resident evil movies Since 2002 our girl kate beckonsail. There's got to be on this list. Yes. She was in a bunch of action movies vampire things Yeah, I can't remember what the name of it was underworld. We should note that she doesn't know she's our girl But she's she's kind of our girl Oh, look at the way she looks at us. Yeah, you could see if you're watching in the screen. You're like gosh. Yes. Wow. Look at their longing eyes She's looking at me and pat. Uh-huh. That's just a thing. Um, yeah looking angelina joleen Laura craft is obviously uh the tomb raider thing. Yep. She also had um where she was the lead Uh, let's see mr. mrs. smith And what was this assault which was an assault assault. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, salt. Yes, that's right Uh that she was not maybe her proudest moment, but it was uh definitely an action movie. Yeah wanted Oh, yeah, which was definitely an action movie. They see that all the time on a netflix I don't watch it, but I did watch it. That's the one where you could curve the bullets, right? Oh, yeah, you know, I kind of did like it was like it's fun It was it's a little bit of a remnant of that era where everyone was like what if we completely over produce every scene You know Oh my gosh. We could do what we could make bullets. What if every single scene has bullets curving? It was that type of movie. Yeah, but like in a way it was so over the top that I really I liked it You know, I I thought I was right. I thought it was salt. I mean it was it's a little ridiculous But it was also solid uh um a thermon. Oh my gosh. Yeah, kill bill. Yeah Uh there was there was According to the article. I don't I don't know this nikita in 1990 uh that only predates Jennifer Lawrence by let's see 22 years Um, so I mean charlie's angels. They're so god charlie's angels was three action movies. Yeah Yeah, so many of them I don't know where she got this or why she thinks she's the trailblazer here, but uh, we got news for you It's you're not it seems like one of these things where Hollywood celebrities are so in their own heads thinking everything about their lives of the most important thing Yep, and that's kind of I think what goes on here, right? I mean It's embarrassing though. Kate peckinsale was underworld by the way. She was in uh that was a big one Mm-hmm and they made a bunch of them You know, she could just how can we put Kate peckinsale and leather pants? I give her this role. I and like look, you know that this would be I guess part of the critique of jennifer lorence maybe And some of these movies are are maybe for older audiences I mean, I don't know is there any argument that she could make I think I don't think so. I don't know I don't think so now look are guys more common in action movies. Yeah, of course because Typically speaking though that is the audience. I mean boys typically, but I will say I Have when people ask what what's your favorite? I actually had that I didn't interview with it. This is a couple of years ago with a with a conservative Entertainment like website and they were like well, what's your favorite genre of movies? And there was like and I was like I was shot. What's my favorite genre was I just thought that was an interesting question like but like you know My horror guy, you know, I watch a horror movie here and there but no Action and not really here. This is what I came up with two. These are my two favorite genres of movies. They're not full genres number one is Dramatic retellings of relatively recent historical events That's a popular genre but it's like yeah, you know And you came up with that on the website. Yes, so it was it was um, they're like We were to like this interview up It took me to light this up with super gear There's like 40 minutes to come up with that, but it's I think it's true Like I'm it's right like you go back to like anything from world war two on Okay, okay. Yep. When you take like an event and I just we mentioned it earlier lord of war is a perfect example of that genre Where like it was a real guy. This is the guy that got traded for britney griner in the in the the swap that happened today Yeah, he was a an arms dealer. Nicholas cage plays him It tells his story about how he got into arms dealing and all this stuff and it's not exactly You know 100 accurate When it comes to that telling it's a somewhat fictionalized but it's based the based on a true story from relatively recent like captain phillips You know, yeah, but those types of movies I freaking love I do too It's just great and I can watch basically any of them Especially if they're based on a true story and pretty close to it the other one my other favorite genre of movies is uh really hot actress kicking everybody's ass I Love those movies. They're just great and like you know What was the one we atomic blonde was the one we talked about surely staring charlie's there and I love that movie She goes around she kicks everybody's butt. She kills a bunch of people. She looks really good doing it. That's the entire movie. It's great It's it's my favorite genre. It's hard to argue with that genre. It's great It's like these women who weigh like 118 pounds just killing like a 340 pound guy and you know, yeah, but they're highly trained I don't care And all of those movies I love and when she said that I was like gosh like not only Is she wrong that they've never tried this it's an entire genre of movie and it's my favorite genre of movie. Yep Yep, and it predated jennifer lords By a lot by a lot. It's not a close call. No, it's really not now atomic blonde was after hunger games It was I think it was 2015 2015. Yeah, by the way, there are plans of an atomic blonde blonde too There that's I'm oh my gosh I'm not saying I've looked because I have Many times because I want a sequel. I think my favorite genre right now is documentaries I don't know what it is about duck. I can't get enough of them Yeah, I don't even count that because that's I'm a huge documentary guy I've loved them forever. I'll watch almost any documentary Netflix has about 714,000 of them so many of them. I mean I'm just Scanning through the movies like you do on Netflix and I thought David Geffen has a documentary I'm watching music and movie mocha David Geffen gotta see that Yeah, and before I know it, I'm watching it Bruce Lee. Oh my gosh or something on Bruce Lee Why don't I do a deep dive into his life which I've been on lately A woman was killed in 1978 and suspicious circumstances and we never solved it wait Gotta find out what happened to this person I never heard of It's incorrect the true crimes does it does a true crime stuff sucky win at all? It does it does yeah it does I like I don't When they come out with new stuff. I will be I don't necessarily jump on the bandwagon right away But the second I'm three minutes into it. I'm locked in for the entire series. Oh, yeah I don't know what it is I've been to several of the crime con events. You know these things crime con crime con. It's a it's a true crime convention It's like the biggest no, and you've gone to a convention of that they're awesome. Oh, you're kidding. Yeah, you know, they're really cool They happen once a year. I think Here in the No, it's all around the country. Okay, and um and they're really really cool And they always have like the best like they'll take whatever the big Netflix series is they have like the lead attorney Who was actually arguing the case and they bring them in and they tell their whole story They have the presentation the photos the documents They try to like solve the cases really it's really interesting and it's one of those things It's just a rabbit hole. Yeah, because you start getting into the true crime stuff. There is endless content It's all Really good. It's amazing how many murders have not been sold. Yes, it's scary. It's only happened a couple of times about 80% of the murders that happened are sold. That's my impression if you look at Netflix I believe we solve 1% of all murders Even it's like it does look like that and the ones that we do solve we're always wrong on the poor people are always Improperly imprisoned. That's the Netflix that the lesson we don't solve any murders and when we do solve them they're wrong But that's another reason for another documentary. Yes Go a documentary on the person who spent 35 years in prison wrongly accused I'm a sucker for that stuff. I do. I love it. I Mean like some of the characters are so freaking crazy and some of the stories are so crazy And they do what law and order does to you where You don't matter what their pitch is you sort of believe it Like it's really hard for me to be critical when i'm watching those things and this is of course why they make documentaries for political Positions because I I don't know the de i'm not an investigator. I'm not Involved in a in the day-to-day investigations of based on the stuff they show you they can lead you down the trail Like you watch these documentaries like oh my gosh how come they won't let this guy at a prison Right and then they you like google it and the person's like actually we have film with him doing it Wait didn't include that why Hey, why would you like an important element that should have been in the documentary? You should have told us they had film of him doing it like right at the beginning of the documentary. I think And they don't do that"
