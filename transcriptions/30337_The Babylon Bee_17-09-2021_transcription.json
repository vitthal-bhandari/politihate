    "text": " Instagram influencer guest host the Babylon Bee podcast and doesn't get canceled? Hey, the Babylon Bee has a hilarious new book coming out. Wait, what are books? Nokia phone survives trip through man's digestive system. The funniest Babylon Bee article of the week. Plus our biggest dud. Cat yeats itself off a football stadium. Is it okay? And no one on earth will ever laugh again. Norm Macdonald has passed away. All this and more on... The Bee Weekly! The Bee are not the Bee. That is the question I ask myself every morning as I drink from my... The Bee? Or not the Bee mug? Now you too can drink from this amazing coffee cup and ask yourself the same question. Which is better, it's so hard to decide. In fact, I would say it's absolutely the battle on Bee, but not the Bee is pretty cool too. Enjoy this mug. Hey everybody, welcome to the Babylon Bee weekly very exciting episode today because Kyle and Ethan are here. Yeah, and a girl? What? In the flesh? No. We usually have a no-girl policy, but we have made an exception today. I'm honored. Welcome Instagram influencer. Chandler Juliet. We wrote that. That's the best singer songwriter named Chandler Juliet. Yeah, it is very good. It's a last name, then a first name. Yeah, well, Chandler. It sounds like a phone book name. People often think that Juliet is my first name. And I'm like, I didn't put a comma. Chandler is my first name. So I'm thinking of just going by Chandler. Or Chandler J, but also... Chandler Juliet is my first and middle name. You ever shorted it to just Chan or like Channy? People call me that. My parents call me Channy. My friends call me Chan and Chandy. Chandy and some of that. Chandy. Yeah, Chandy. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks guys. Well, so we got some weird news. I want to mention on Tuesday, actually on Monday, if you're a subscriber, we have possibly my favorite interview we've ever done. If you're a fan of prank shows, scare tactics, pranking counters on Netflix, Fameless, which is one of my favorites, but is lesser known for True TV, and a bunch of other ones, you'll recognize Dave Storrs. He's one of the prank masters on this show and the hilarious comedian who acts alongside these people that are being pranked. He came and we love got-knee-cool stories. That's our favorite question. This guy had just nothing but great stories about pranking poor people. Well, not poor people. They're poor. Yeah. Yeah, not money-wise. Unfortunate. Unfortunate people. Some of them might have been poor. Really funny. Lots of laughter. It was a great episode that's coming up next. Fantastic. If you're a Babylonian super fan on YouTube, you smash the join button, you get it early. Also, if you're a subscriber on our site at Babylonb.com slash plans, you get it daily. Everybody knows it'll be done too. Everybody knows it'll be subscriber portions. They get the extended version. Or we got even more crazy stories out of Dave Storrs. He should have been called Dave Storrs. That should be his real name. Hey, we're going to do something new this week. We're going to try to do this every week. We'll see how it goes. If you hate it, let us know. We're going to go back to reading some Babylon B articles on the air. We're going to have a book used to do way back in the day. We're going to have a banger of the week, which is an article that did very well. We're going to have a bomb of the week, or dud of the week, which is an article that nobody liked, nobody shared. Except for us. But we thought it was hilarious. We're going to do that. Then in the subscriber portions, subscribers and YouTube super fans are going to get the classic article of the week where we read one from three, four years ago. In the olden days. Exactly. This week. Four or five years ago. Yeah. The before times. Oh, the empire before Seth Dylan bought the site and ruined it. It was pretty funny. You'll get that article if you subscribe. All right. Let's do our banger of the week. Banger of the week. Biden unveils your body. My choice vaccination program in a speech today, Joe Biden unveiled a brand new program to force the rest of the country to get vaccinated entitled your body. My choice. Listen, folks, make mistake. Make no mistake, said the president reading carefully up the teleprompter. I have complete control and sole authority over everything you do with your body and everything you put in your body. I'm the government for God's sakes. I have F 15s and nukes just gets the vaccine. Just do it. But and then walked out of the room to get a snack. Many concerns remained around the issues of freedom and natural immunity, but the president was already eating his applesauce with crushed up pills in it and was unable to answer questions. Companies will be forced to comply with the mandate until the Supreme Court strikes it down in just a few hours. So yeah, you see like people on Twitter really slobbering like excited about the idea of forcing vaccines on people. Yes. Finally. Yeah. We've used the carrot. Now it's time for the stick. Yeah, stab them. Stab them all. Stab them with the stick. I always amazed I see the polls and they're like, this majority of Americans support the vaccine mandate. Like there's a majority that supports. Isn't that weird? How many states are like, nope, they were bunch, right? Yeah, there was like 30 years. I think half of the states immediately said no. And then I don't know how many since then. I was like 25 out of 50 immediately. Yeah, noped out. You got to think that he's doing this through OSHA, which was the weird thing and sees instead of like passing it through Congress or even an executive order, he just said, this is a new OSHA policy. So it's just going through these weird like has nothing OSHA. Like don't they just, are they just supposed to make sure you don't run over people with forklips? I don't know. It's not an OSHA. OSHA. That sounds like a singer, a songwriter name. Their main job is to make sure you don't run over by a forklift. Yeah. All right. Yeah. Well, you know, I do, I do stand by my belief that if they had just released the vaccine and not been so weird about it and psycho about it, more people would have taken it. I might have gotten it. You got it. No, I didn't. Oh, you didn't. I might have gotten it. I'm sorry. I would have been more ready to get it. Perhaps. It made it so weird and like I feel so yeah. So and then everything went on with my wife. We've already been over that, but it's like just creeped out by it now. Yeah. There's something a little bit creepy about it. Really political. Yeah. Yeah. Well, there's like a lack of transparency in the conversation is the biggest issue. It's weird. It's sort of like when you ask a girl out, but then you add on to it, like, I really like you a lot. Like if you just said, like, want to go to a cup of coffee, like if a way better chance with that girl than if you added on, like, I've been thinking about you for years and I finally brought the courage to say, I want to ask you out of coffee because the Lord says we should be together forever. Yeah. Or like my psychic told me you were the one and. I just told me or like a psychic or like the, I want to hear about this. I'm trying to think too about like, if they were like, you know, you ask a girl out and then you say, and I will call your employer and get you fired. If you don't say, yeah, yeah. It's that level of creepy. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. And if you don't, then you're an anti something. Yeah. If I can't have you, no one can. Joe Biden whispering that at a press conference to the like for 11 year old girl. Yeah. Done. The work. Now, to clarify, this article is hilarious. It is great. And it's written by our own Frank Fleming. So Frank, congratulations. The first bomb of the week goes to you. The thing about posting satire on social media is the articles that are not about a current political event are never going to get a lot of shares, which is frustrating for somebody who just wants to be funny. You just want to be funny. And that's all Frank cares about. He's like Norm McDonald live that way in that way. But good job. If Norm McDonald wrote for the man on B, he would always get bomb of the week. Norm McDonald loved bombing. Yeah. Because he liked it. Yeah. We'll talk about that in our normal portion. But yeah, he has the whole thing about that. So our bomb of the week is a food review written by our own toddler critic, which is a character that Frank created named Oliver Bartholomew. Oliver Bartholomew is a two year old. I think Chandler would be a great voice to read this. Okay. So the food review is of ketchup, a complex, well crafted culinary delight. Let's see what Bartholomew has to say. Bartholomew is a how old? Oliver both. He's like two. Okay. But it's like the Calvin and Hobbes humor where Calvin is five, but he talks like he's got it. Okay. Here we go. Should I speak in the voice now? Whatever Phil. You do your thing. I'm not usually very picky when it comes to what I'll put in my mouth, except when it comes to food. If I don't like the look of it or the smell of it, or if I just feel like I'm not getting enough attention, I will throw it. But there is one delicacy I've discovered that I will almost never toss ketchup. Is ketchup the perfect food? In my multiple years, I've certainly never encountered anything better. Tangy, sweet, beautiful color, pleasing mouth feel. Also a pleasing face feel when I spread it all over my face. Now often I'll eat it by myself, but it also combines so well with other foods. I've dipped so many things in ketchup, French fries, corn chips, pretzel sticks, blueberries, my sippy cup, and whatever is in region my high chair. And it enhances the flavor of everything. That's why I demand ketchup now at every meal. If I have ever seated to eat and there is no ketchup, I will make my displeasure known. I'm a connoisseur. I only want the best, and that means ketchup with everything. So just bring it over and leave the bottle if you know what's good for you. I think that's so cute. I see what you mean though. It's not about the content. It's not going to hold my lips. It's about the clicks and the intention grabbing aspect of it. Like nobody's going to share that and go, this is so true. I love the idea of doing the video where you see the baby and you have the inner monologue playing like that in adult voice. It's a classic idea. It's a good idea. It's a good idea. It's a good idea. It's a good idea. Slo-mo-mo-mo. Yeah, the thing room. Yeah, looking new. Ketchup bottle. Well, follow the Babbel on B if you want more Oliver Barfalle me. Because he's already reviewed Cocomelon. Oh, okay. That's a big one. The YouTube channel. And I think we're working on some literature reviews for him and some music reviews. I like that they've been being outraged about, what is it? Oh, baths. Babs? Yeah. We can do it for a few months. I've always wanted to do a story where we have a parent convicted of attempted murder by a baby judge because they tried to give him a bath. Because they think you're trying to kill them when you give them a bath. A baby judge. In their mind, yeah. True. Ethan's sense of humor is just having babies do adult things. That's one of my many. I mean, I have, I got bears too. Let's do some weird news. This news is weird. McDonald's diner horrified turns to veganism. I think he could just end it right there. As he finds- Turn up. In his bacon roll. That's a bacon roll. That's a picture. It's a UK thing. No, it's a UK thing. Oh, God. He says he found it in the car and he says it was a pig nipple once he got back. Is a pig shipment in there? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I mean, you're eating all these parts of a pig and then the nipple grosses you out. Right. That's what's going to- You don't know what's in that hot dog you eat, boss. That's it. I'm sure there's nipples glowing hot dogs. It says he contemplated turning to vegan as well. He just contemplated and he's like, wow. He's just a big talker. Yeah, he's got to pull the trigger man. He'll be coming back to the bacon. He'll be coming back. Did I ever tell when I worked at a buffet restaurant, I used to have to bread the chicken in the morning. Can I tell this story about the chicken, the two connected chicken thighs? I don't think so. I found in this box that they have all the cut up chicken. Yeah. I pulled out a thigh, which you know is one side of the butt. Yeah. So then I picked it up and then the other thigh was still connected. Uh-huh. And in between the two thighs was a little ring, which you know that's a butt. It's a chicken butthole. It's the butt. He's talking about the butthole. So I was actually able to like cut off and I had a chicken butthole. Can I say that on this show? I'm like- A-nus. It's like a ring. That's what I thought this picture was at first. I'm like, uh, are we sure that's a nipple? Yeah, it doesn't really look like this. Yeah. This does feel like very- But it was legit. R-rated content for the B. But hey. A pig nipple. We're moving- we're progressing. This is just progress, right? Yeah. But we're trying to be more open-minded. I feel like you could have done guess what chicken butt. Well I did. I-I-I camera how I got her to do it. There's a girl at work there and I go uh- I camera I made some joke about I was going to put a ring on her finger and she put her hand out and I put the chicken. I put it on her finger like- Yeah. And then she's like, what is that? I go, that's a chicken butt. Oh my god, did she say yes? I guess so. She put the ring in the ring. Really? Yeah. That's not how I met my wife. Oh my god. Thank god. Wow. All right for the three of you still listening. Let's go on to story number two. Some people find anatomy and nature fascinating. Yes, three of them. Trans-vider who served in the army special forces pulverizes first female opponent in MMA debut. Well, we've come a long way. Is this a sighting? Well, well done. Alan and McLaughlin, the second openly transgender woman to compete in MMA in the United States won her debut Friday night via submission. The 38 year old used a rear naked choke against Celine Provost. Provost. To end the match, three minutes, 32 seconds into the second round. So McLaughlin began her gender transition after leaving the US Army special forces in 2010 and said she hopes to be a pioneer for transgender athletes in combat sports. You better not be putting scare quotes around her pronouns there. Her, I just make, you know, it's what it sounds like. He's not, he's just emphasizing. He's emphasizing that it is her. It's a half quote. Her? You can do the one quotes. I'm just quoting other people saying her. Yeah. I think it's a big step forward for wife beaters and, well, I mean, people who like to punch around. There's terms that you only use on men, like D-bag and like things like that. You don't think it's weird to call a woman that, but he's breaking that glass ceiling like she, she's breaking that glass. Now I can say she's a real D-bag. I want to know how Celine Provost felt about knowing that she was going to be here. She gets to be like, yeah, this is, this is good. I'll volunteer to be the first, the first person to get bashed by in like a new second. Well, what was the, the, the, another one before. My name is Bastian in the name of progress. But the first one by this person, right? Yeah. This is the first one by you. She gets to be like a, you know, like a fern crossing the trail that he's pioneering and he just takes it out of the way like a machete. She. Sorry. I keep messing up. Yeah, dude. I feel like no matter where you are on like the LGBTQ question, the rights, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, whatever, it's like, can we all just be like men should not be the woman like shouldn't, I don't know why we can. Yeah. We should at least, whatever. We just all join hands. It seems. And that should be obvious aspect. Yeah. Yeah. That's one that just seems obvious. It seems obvious. I don't know. Yeah. Here we are reading this. What do I know? Yeah. It's baffling. I am baffled. Are you baffled? I find myself baffled. Oh, this moment. I really do want to talk to person is excited about this goes, yes, we're progressing or doing this. I do think that they, they think that this is just kind of a necessary evil to get to the point where like there's all one gender all melded together and like, whatever. It's like, yeah. Because they really don't believe that he was ever he or that he is becoming a she right because gender is a social construct. So that's the weird thing. Right. So it's like, what do they really think? I just want to get in your head. People that are excited about this. There's got to be somebody. Cheering. Yeah. The weird thing about the people. I checked the audience and they put it in the footage and be like, who's cheering? What is he is cheering? The weird thing about the people who fight the women who agree to fight. It's like, you know, you were saying that. Yeah. I was like, what is going through her head? Like, yeah, that's fine. But yeah, it's. Her. Her. Her. Oh, it's just shocking. Yeah, that's fine. I mean, she's always been a woman in a man's body and I'm going to fight that body, but it's a woman now and always has been. Let's do. Yeah. Yeah. It's over. Yeah. I wonder if they kind of agree with it on a, on a, from a worldview perspective and they have an faux financial lol, they're gonna have her on sushi list. Oh my god, you know, for my life. So if they want somebody else to add, hey, they should fly. You know, might not have that anymore. Okay. Oh, I'm struggling to get this guy on Why let you do these in front of you, like, and that working weird thing with like, what are you doing now? That works so hard for me but I mean, you do. Like, you've autoimmune makeup, maybe thisll got like curb effects for existing makeup and bloom negatives or maybe. MMA, you know, then you're going to get a trans man fighting a trans woman. Well, it's women sports and it's men sports men and women don't fight each other So there will be like trans man trans women sports or giving them like an opportunity to like I think that would be fine Instagram influencer solves trans sports dilemma The cat was dangling from the upper level of a stadium during a college football game and some dudes with an American flag Saved its life when it lost its grip. Oh This is an amazing video. I hope they can put it up on the thing, but it's it's fantastic Yeah, this was like on 9-11 wasn't it? I think this was like really the anniversary of 9-11 20th anniversary these guys That's why they had this American flag at this game and they catch the cat. Wow. It wasn't that. Wow. I like the idea that Because we were supposed to not like those people right that wave American flags So it should be shouldn't be bad Watching it now. Yeah, no, I just well I think that the American flag is making a comeback then because we had we saved a cat He's that's positive and all the negatives of the American flag You know how it oppressive and horrible it is you could just put one thing on this column here good Yeah, American flag bad list like 100 million thousand whatever and then we have one Colonial Saves cats though saves cat and that saved a cat. Well, which isn't followed the you know There's a screenwriting book that says save the cat's how to write a good story One of the things is an element is make your character save a cat you make him likable even if he's really unlikable So maybe this guy is that's like anestive a story the American flag is needed this all along save the cat now It's likable. So we don't know how many cats. It's already saved. This is the only one that's getting video. Yeah, press coverage So they needed that it's probably safe many cats. It's good PR. I'm a American flag. I got a new publicist Here's what we need to do now. We need to write the dangle a cat It's gonna be a big event. Why did he televised? Football game. So what so he said people on Twitter didn't didn't like this. Oh, no, I was That was my joke. He was trying to own well Twitter found the footage very troubling because they're thinking I Can just see how impressive to catch the cat and make contact Is it wouldn't it be better that the cat died rather than have to live with the trauma of being engulfed in the American flag? It's true Hey, some guys airlifted rhinos upside down and they won a joke award for it. We called the picture Wait, is this real though? This is real wait Do you think that they're comfortable like that? I guess they usually airlift them right side up and they decided to try this out. Oh, I don't think that's right They say it's better. You know in your head like Russia steer blood Russia steer head when you're like turn upside down I'm pretty sure that that's are they okay? I'm like really concerned I'm always concerned like laying in bed or whatever because it's not fully upside down like That picture looks like he's being hung completely upside down from his from his ankle but I mean like you vertically upside down Right because your head's not at the bottom like Grant if it was caught by an American flag He would hug a hole through it. I was hanging from like a hammock an American flag hammock. It was laying inside of it. Yeah Well, I would prefer that because I want the rhino to be comfortable I like this that they have a organization the parodies the Nobel Prize called the ignobell prize Classic wait, why were they moving the rhinos in the first place? It says conservation. It's some constrificial Okay, so it wasn't for 10 ring and God's domain their researchers well They say it works better for them apparently they check their vital signs and things And apparently they're you know, they're breathing and circulation I think it's better when they're hung upside down That feels wrong because they're normally right side up They are not but also their weights probably always usually on their feet And to be hanging where all their weights on their like midsection. Maybe that's maybe it's hard on their ribcage or something They're heavy animal. Yeah, they are heavy rhinos are heavy Yeah, I think the hammock would be a nice try it'd be nice to give them just need a rhino cage With stuff in it a little wheel and then they just carry that rhino wheel. Yeah, I like to think of some higher intelligence being took over and like you were just hanging out with your buddies and They grab you by your feet and like I just feel like they got frank You know on the wrist like can you imagine like they're tying it all their legs up like yeah I feel like yeah, he's going to get I've been chosen right dropped right directly into the stew Like a militarized version of like the evil witch that eats children in the old fairy tales Shows up with a black-hot helicopter Log ties you and flies off Wait, sorry I'm reading the next one what I'll read it. I'm supposed to I'm just lost my doc Oh, no, is it in the tab this guy swallowed his Nokia 3310 cell phone and had to have it removed from his stomach Doctors and Kosovo had to perform performed surgery on a man who swallowed his Nokia 3310 cell phone which became lodged in his tummy Reports say the phone was too large for him to digest So it couldn't fit outside of that thing the chicken had and his life was in danger because it's corrosive battery Acid could have leaked into a stomach. How did he get it through his throat if it's too big to digest? How did he get it through the first? 110 like the old one that played snake. Oh, it's a little one. Why did he swallow it? Better something Amused maybe had texts on there. You didn't want to be in three pieces So the stomach actually like broke up the phone in three pieces. Yeah, yeah, you could swallow that thing. No problem Wait, I want to see I'm like that. That's just the old school like plate snake on it I mean that would yeah, it would hurt that'd be like a Python But how did he do that and I want video of that. Yeah, who's this guy? I think the real question is why is he gonna? Yeah, I think he might have lost a bet This is kind of stupid, but I like how it says the phone was too large for him to digest like that's not the main problem Wait, what's on the phone that he's trying to hide who that could be who swallows his phone? Usually they try it the other way, but I would that no and then it broke up Instructions unclear swallowed Nokia There's been other times they say in 2014 a 35 year old drunken male attempted to swallow their phone and lodged it in their throat Before was surgically removed and then another one a 29 year old swallowed their phone despite several hours of vomiting the phone remained in their stomach And the doctors had to remove it. So this is not new But still there's no why and drunk and you guys drunk so I guess that excuses everything Dude Yeah, I don't think I think that's an excuse. I think that this guy might be like It was very slow like yeah Yeah, I think the cops were coming in it's kind of like when a guy has a bunch of drugs and they like the cop shop And he shows a wall in his throat and swells him hoping that they you know, they don't burst open in there same thing Yeah And oh who he still has one of those phones too. That's why I'm saying there's something really fishing There's something definitely fishy about this or he's so poor he can only afford a crappy phone like that So hungry he ate it. No Look how dirty it looks. Yeah, that doesn't look like that's not stomach fluid. That's like dirty This there was something up with this more to come on this. That's a poof phone Yeah, maybe he just had a boy Say he had a tough conversation and he just needed to chew on it for a while That's a pretty good one. You're good at those. Thank you I Think it's your turn Florida man. Juliet Chandler. Come on man. People are actually gonna think that that's my name There was a comment there Yeah Florida man gets fed up with pothole in front of his business and plants a banana tree in it Aww this is smart for Florida story. Yeah, I love this after failed attempts at getting the country to fill a pothole in front of Oh, oops. Sorry Take two the whole country Right imagine the power of Florida man can have After failed attempts at getting the county to fill a pothole in front of his business Florida man Brian Raymond took matters into his own hands planting a banana plant in the pothole Happy ending for everyone Drivers have been forced to swerve around the pothole and even stop short at last resort Raymond noted that we have to maintain it and make sure nobody gets hurt We're going to put something obvious there to make sure to make sure nobody gets in the hole Officials say it is a private road and it's not their problem So whose road is it? So who's been who's gonna eat the bananas? Who will help me plant the banana Community bananas, I guess who will help me eat the banana plant the irony will be when somebody like you know actually hits that tree dies And then a bunch of bananas fall in them and everybody gets bananas wait, so it's a private road So he's been trying to get the county to fill it like So who owns the private land? Yeah, I don't know I don't know how it works over there. So now they're saying like yeah, it's cool. We're not gonna fill the pothole We're not gonna cut down your tree You know, it's not our problem. It's it's a great solution. Nobody goes in the pothole now. They just run into a tree Yeah much better I hope that it's uh A deep enough pothole that it's rich in nutrients and Soils that the banana plant can You don't have a full life expectancy. You should do one of those really spiky cactuses Ooh, yeah, people will definitely stay away from yours or like poison ivy or something Yeah, yeah Yeah, I think the banana tree is probably more Obvious, I actually don't know what they look like is there a picture of this one palm tree It's palm tree wait. There is a picture. It is palm tree I'm just gonna start clicking all the links. Yeah, this is actually wow And it's so cute. Florida. So the climate there the climate. Yeah, it's gonna be perfect The climate is like it just put a giant alligator inside of it. It's true. Good job, brian raiment or an old person Retired just open a retirement community inside the pothole Like the old people that greet you at walmart like the walmart doesn't really need them to do that job. Yeah They're just but it's a helping out. It's a feature. Yeah Helping out. Yeah, just aren't they kind of like Watching though Greeders don't check. No, I'm thinking of no greed is check the receipts on the way Well, the guy at the exit door No, I think a lot of walmart's have an old guy at the front who like puts a smiley face sticker on the kids and like I wonder if that's different in like a big city walmart and this because small town walmart's for sure Have those greeters at least they used to yeah, but I haven't seen one in like the one in out where I live here I guess I don't know if I've seen one recently. Well, the one that I go to here is like it's like a really packed walmart There's like stuff everywhere like it's crammed and like It just feels like a I don't know. It's a little suspicious. It's sus. It's sus among us I think that the uh greeter during the covid times is doing a few more tasks Right, they're like keeping an eye on the line outside. They're they're doing the the counting to make sure Well, they used to like do they shake hands or they just say hi? No, they don't Not now they wouldn't that would take too long even before I like the idea of a walmart It's greeting your name's bah I feel like I'm ever getting handshakes, but I can have a small enough town that they can pull it up and you They would shake your hand. Yeah, maybe not now. It's not depending on depending on the greeter. Yeah, you know Right. They seemed enjoy it Growing up the church we went to had an old really old guy that was the greeter and he always wore a red sports coat Like just normal suit and then big red sports coat and he would shake your hand and like you would hear the bones crunch as you You know, you really work those taint shakles All right, how do we get into that? I have no idea so a man Used his hands to move 114 ounces of water in 30 seconds for world record Whoa, I need to see his hand which is very exciting Wow, we should all be very excited by this news I want to say we should retry to recreate that But there's all these you know, we got to find out the size of the opening and everything that you're allowed to do There's probably a lot of specifications and water moving challenge. It's our old friend David rush David rush. Wow He's a career Record Who just does weird The dumbest things on earth to promote stem education. Okay, there's a cause it's not all for his own I know but if you really want that to be heard anonymously then I don't know he could have picked a few other Causes but hey stem Is he I mean he's doing well. It's 200 200 world records or Guinness is he gonna beat the world record for having the most world records or has he already done that? I think that's probably his goal, right? Probably already has it would be listed here if he had already done that as broken more records than it He has the world record for breaking the most records You've already talked about him more than Kyle is Stupid yeah, he's over it But if you can get 200 world records then the standard for a world record is too low If one person can get 200 I wonder if they can win the world record for the lowest standards of world records. They already have Already he did a big jump the previous record was 88 ounces So that's that's a pretty big I can't respect that but once again if you're if the previous record is 88 and you get 114 That just means it's not this serious evolution We should do a Babylon B games where we we try to we try to beat a couple of these world The water transfer The Capri Sun I broke my percent world record We basically lying around the exact he thinks he wanted but Patrick timed it wrong, but I did according to the timer I drank I drank a Capri Sun faster than the current world record for drinking and you got it on tape Yeah, wait, but she totally like give it to me you got a submit it You could re-time it out from the tape and see like I guess you could yeah, it's on test all there on That's digital tape. That sounds like a fun challenge though. Capri Suns are fire. Especially like wait. What was the flavor? Remember you probably tropical punch something yeah, yeah surfing. Yeah, they don't have like fun names I can't remember them right now radical a sack radish party So we got two games need to come up with a third But we'll even if you look at even if you look at even if you look at video game speed running Like when someone's going up an odd someone beats super Mario 64 in like 21 minutes or something the next guy who beats it beats it in like 20 minutes and 59 Second, you know 59 seconds at 0.5 9 5 2 whatever It's like these incremental things unless someone figures out this crazy cheat to get farther or whatever to do it faster But to go like from 114 to 88 that is not you don't see that like in the Olympics, right? You don't see like this guy's Swam and he get three minutes in the next guy. He cut the time in half amazing because it's not real It's just not really shooting Well, this guy is definitely like going through the world records like okay. We could try that one I think he's making a lot one and then he goes look record keeping agency provided him with the specific rules regarding how large the openings on his containers were allowed So maybe the other person didn't optimize their water transfer and he's just very intentional about like Knocking him out. It's true. But he's also making up events It is like if you could go to the olympics and be like I am going to compete in pogo stick true You know, you just can't make up stuff right like double foot pogo stick with a chicken on my head The record for having the most amounts of nipples in my mcdonald's bacon bacon roll he's a world record holder Yeah, that other guy's two. Yeah, the first man to find He broke the knippling the rogue pig nipple in the bacon roll Well, that'll be our third game then by the way, we're deep in our bleeping the Turn up every time it is said on this time.

Why am I saying holidays? Sorry? Yes, sorry holidays This is a Christmas celebrating podcast, right? Oh, so funny. Oh, that's hilarious now. We are serious because we are remembering norm mcdonald Although he wouldn't want us to be serious. I think He did that he did this funny. Uh, he mentioned I think it was on one of his shows. He said uh Oh, yeah, he says people like oh, I just want everybody to have a great time and laugh at my funeral and like I don't know. I'm pretty crying and just be horrified It's like a guy died. He should be laughing Uh, but that's so so okay. So this is like completely caught everybody about complete surprise I don't know if you're a norm mcdonald fan or know him you seem young and yeah, I don't know who that is I'm gonna do a quick google search. Hold on. Hold on. I bet I know what he looks like Hold on a lot of younger people don't know because that's the thing about norm mcdonald is like oh, yes Okay, yes, he never I saw this guy's picture and I was in movies and even had some movies But he never really nothing ever really worked for him except for just him on a stage in a comedy club He didn't like theaters He just he lived in that uh That space and he Uh, he's in a lot of ways like I think adam crow explained it really well Like why comedians respected norm mcdonald's so much He said like engineers They a lot of them go to college. They do the thing the way the engineers do things They follow the instructions. They play by the rules Comedians do the same thing like they uh, they practice They do the same jokes over every night and they engineer their set in a certain way that they're telling the same jokes and the ones they get the best laugh Norm was not like that like he did retail jokes, but like he didn't ever like whittle down like a perfect set and have a big theater like uh production thing like he wanted to have a joke about every single topic And his funniest material is just him talking to people in conversation because he just worked on being naturally funny um So anyway Cancer, huh He had cancer for basically a decade and told i so far i haven't heard of anybody that he was the closest people to him He did he kept it secret from everybody Wow, how what kind of cancer do we know that's very norm. Yeah, it's just Be like wow, I just can't tell you it's connected to that old fashionness of his like there's a stoic side to him because he clearly uh You could tell by some of the things he said that he read a lot of classic literature and he had this very intellectual side to him that would come out Especially once he got onto twitter that was like I remember I was never a huge norm fan until I suddenly saw him popping on twitter and like getting to these theological debates of people and like laying down some pretty serious arguments It's just kind of like wow there's like another side to this guy and I I instantly became fascinated by the You know Being an intelligent person in your personal life, but then kind of playing the dumb guy. I I found I don't know I find nor I have always found him like endlessly fascinating And I do think that there's some He's kind of a Jordan Peterson of comedy though like Jordan Peterson. He doesn't he doesn't have one speech he gives everywhere in the country He talks on whatever is on his mind every night. He's on the stage isn't There isn't really a perfect venue for that Uh, it's just him and I think that's what norm was It's just it's just norm dude his quote about the enlightenment Did you read that on twitter? Where he said the enlightenment turned us away from truth and toward a darkling weakening horizon sad and great to see The afterglow of christianity is near gone now and a sticky in silence lurks in weight Yeah, he's so done. Yeah, he just randomly says these and people are like That's a joke right No, that's amazing. I definitely think that that's one of my favorite types of stand-up when I went to a outdoor comedy show during the panini Um first one back and it was like on a truck I'm like a pickup truck in like a small lot and a bunch of people everyone was great But this one guy came up and he just started like wing it all right He just started like working with the crowd and I was I was like blown away So he's coming up with this on the spot or at least that's what it appears like and that's that's a really cool John wrath comedy I just love another amazing thing he tweeted on the 500th anniversary of the reformation He tweeted out scripture faith grace christ the glory of god the smart man says nothing is a miracle I say everything is Like holy cow, you know this guy Yeah, he just like roasts oj simpson and built an on live tv and then he's just tweeting out this but that's a v Was he unable to be pinned down? You know, was he did people start to attack and like oh, he's just like a patriarchal All right, all because his whole comedy community loved him And they all wanted You know, he he was always like why is there not a late night norm show and he had youtube show for a while It was huge because it was just it's one of the funny shows you'll watch just him talking But you don't you don't see him doing that kind of package, but he doesn't yeah You can't do the tell prompter like that's what I was uh I can't remember who was telling the story I just heard but like it was the saturday night live of a 40th anniversary Whatever and they had all the things and they all had a line they're supposed to do off of cue cards And he said of course the moment norm went up. He didn't say anything on the cue card he started talking But he just said what he like he didn't care So that was like one of the craziest things about him I think for people that don't know him and like why is he why is he above the rest? Some of the things during all the oj simpson stuff Norm was told multiple times by his boss not to make oj simpson jokes on saturday night live And he would always open weekend update with an oj simpson joke He just would not stop Wait, what did he say? He got fired he got fired because of it. What were the jokes? They were brutal. They're just kind of one of an after he after oj was acquitted. He uh The first thing he did just a picture of oj pops up and he goes Oh, he's like murder is now legal in the state of california Pretty much. Okay. So what did he say about rosanne and luisa k So he um When both of them had been canceled He had had a conversation with the two of them and he felt very bad for them, especially I think rosanne and Um, you know these people's careers that they built up to and he he made some statement how I can't already said he said that it was It sounded like he was saying that it was worse than like what happened to the women And he didn't mean it that way but people took it out of context and freaked out on him And he had this netflix show that was supposed to happen and oh no hank Maybe season one happen. I can't remember exactly but adam's lack there twitching wanted to tell us Everything's more from adam insider Adam and just gonna be on the subscriber lounge. He worked with norm a bunch on the konan of brian show But anyway, he just he had to do this apology on the view which just turned out to be worse and he Really did uh never apologize. I mean we're learning that now He was trying to clarify and that was one of the things that messed up is so cringy First he tried to apologize and he said uh, you know saying that about the victims would that would just pack saw Oh, no, he said he stopped himself. He says that would just be rich. You'd have to have down syndrome I like it. He just keeps making it Apology for saying that oh no I think is he is a comic from you say what's on your mind Right and that's that's something they need to protect as an artist And I think that's what is so scary or that's what is being threatened right now And this time is everyone's being really careful walking on eggshells, but that's not what true artists and What it's not what true artists are supposed to do and it's not what we're supposed to do in general because we have still Hopefully we have it for a little bit longer the right to free speech in this country and that's that's how we actually have conversations and learn instead of you know Being controlling and weird and dishonest and inauthentic Our culture is just at war with honesty like we we want everybody to have the script and everybody go by the script and that's why people like norm Standout because norm will not go by the script. I mean you go you look at all the Standout moments his appearance on the view when they kept telling him to stop talking about bill clinton And he just kept saying what he murdered a guy Wait, really? He went that far He comes up and he says something I think George Bush had just gotten elected and he comes up and says something about I like George Bush good guy, you know, he's like it's the time we got homicide out of the White House, you know Last guy murdered a guy Just like you cannot make those accusations on live TV. He's like, okay, fine. It was manslaughter. Whatever I would love wow this is yeah, if you don't know about normal primer Watch the norm McDonald the view talking about bill clinton OJ jokes. You'll see there's all these there's a there's a youtube channel called I'm not norm that just has a bunch of them. He is very craft and vulgar when he wants to be His tone and appearances and the moth joke is one of the best. I'm trying not to just make this us just cracking up and reminiscing on norm stuff, but Is uh, if you ever watch his comedians and cars getting coffee. Did you see that one? That's one of the greatest and there's a moment where uh, he says something to jerry sinefeld like oh, you know You don't have any kids, but in sine months like yeah, I do I've got three kids And he's like what it's I'm sure yeah, I've got you know girl two boys or whatever. He's like all right. Well agree to disagree That's what i'm saying. It was him in conversation. Just always the best And uh one of his famous moments is he was he didn't like roasts, but he was on the bob saggot roast And so because you know everybody's being vulgar and mean and crass he goes up there and he just does all the like the cheesiest Old he found this old timey joke book And he goes up there and he just starts telling like the cheesiest jokes. He's like, oh, you know, I'm sure bob saggot's got a lot of well Well-wishers out here today, but he's also got a lot of people who'd like to throw him into a well I'm murdering with a well Overexplains these really bad jokes. It was just in the context of it. It was so funny. What's the moth joke? Oh, man. He just got to watch it. You got to watch it. We can't we cannot explain Watch the konin one or I think the best version is if you listen to his audiobook Uh because he he narrates it. I think he does the most epic, you know crafted version of that joke Yeah, but he basically took I mean the the story of it is he took uh he had like a six or seven however long the segment was on konin coming up and he didn't have any material And he'd heard this cheesy moth joke that an old man told him and he just goes What if I could just milk that joke out for that long just like the dumbest joke ever And it's a it's a masterpiece All right I've seen him on a lot of tv shows. I definitely recognize his face Um seems like I have some research to do Yeah, a few quotes comedy is surprises So if you're intending to make somebody laugh and they don't laugh that's funny Yeah, his he loved bombing and like loved like he just yeah, he loved just essentially you watch because words shows and things He comes on he loved like he loved making them not laugh And he loved like he loved that that silence intention and just sitting there with a big crappy and grin on his face Get it. Yeah, it actually the punchline was just him going. Okay. We wrote that joke about that moment AOC accidentally strangling herself with her shoelaces because she's so stupid And uh we can't we put that in the headline because she's so stupid And to me that is our most norm joke because it's like eh, this is so stupid, eh Get it? It's funny because she's so stupid And the funniest thing is that when people every time we post that article people get mad at it And then like slam it and like you get all these comments and the comments are gold And so then we'll reply well like we'll issue a clarification Just as a clarification the joke is that she's stupid You know and then people are still like slamming you like And that's the best part to me is Making the audience the butt of the joke and they don't know that they are So that was Frank's joke and I think probably very norm-inspired Of when he uh so a year after leaving snl they brought him back on as a host So The idea that because the when his boss fired him he told him you're just not funny. That was the reason he gave it Yeah, everybody knew it was the oj thing. Yeah, he's like, oh, that's worse. Why couldn't they just be real? He's so real. Why couldn't they just meet him where he is? Like he's like that's worse. I mean like getting fired from a show is bad, but i'm not funny. That's like my whole career So in a year right back He's the host he goes how did I go from being not funny enough to be even allowed in the building to being so funny that i'm now hosting the show And he said i think he concluded i haven't gotten funnier the show has gotten really bad He said that on his nose Here for this And then kind of a touching one this is from his book One of the more honest moments in his book that is a mixture of truth and fiction It can be difficult to define yourself by something that happened so long ago and it's gone forever He's talking about the oj Stuff that happened moj and he said he says that everybody's remembering for what happened on the weekly update Mm It's like a fellow at the end of the bar telling no one in particular about the silver medal He won in high school track the one he still wears around his neck The only thing an old man can tell a young man is that it goes fast real fast And if you're not careful, it's too late. Of course the young man will never understand this truth But you got to hear norm say it on the end. Yeah, yeah, he's that old chunk of cold voice. So what do you think he means? No one no one's really gonna understand that yeah, because he's saying like i'm trying to let go of this thing and yeah Yeah, there's definitely some like the one thing you need to know it's like a fun thing you can't understand until it's too late I think it's yeah, youth is wasted on the young and all that deep Deep all right. Well, we're gonna talk more about normie Donald in the subscriber lounge where we have an insider who worked with him And he's gonna give us all kinds of stuff I was telling he actually worked he was there that night when norm told them out the moth joke on cone.
