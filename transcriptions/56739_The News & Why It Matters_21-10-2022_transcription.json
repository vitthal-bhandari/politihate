Welcome to the news and why it matters. Happy Friday. I am Sarah Gonzalez. And we are joined today by Yaku Booyens, Belize TV contributor and host of the bottom line also. But you know, it's a day of Blase TV contributors, actually. Another Blase TV contributor, John Doyle, also host of Hekoff-Kami, who is appropriately dressed for fall weather, which I appreciate. It's true. You should have seen me last week. That's for Blase TV members only. That's for Blase after dark? Yeah, when people get to see the pumpkin pants. The pumpkin pants that he was wearing. I've heard of the pumpkin pants. They were very fall. I loved it. Also, Blase TV contributor Alex Stein, host of conspiracy castle. So I want to see all the, I mean, I've got these two on and you were probably definitely getting banned from YouTube really quickly. So I want to see how quickly that actually happens. But if it does end up happening, make sure that you go over to Blase TV and subscribe so you can finish watching the episode. So first up, Steve Bannon has been sentenced to four months in prison and a $6,500 fine for contempt of Congress due to ignoring a subpoena from the January 6th committee. Now he was claiming executive privilege precluded him from appearing before the committee. And Bannon was released pending appeal. If an appeal is not made, Bannon must voluntarily surrender by November 15th. The Justice Department, of course, was the one who had recommended a six month prison sentence and a $200,000 fine. And when entering the courthouse today, Steve Bannon said, remember this illegitimate regime, their judgment day is on the 8th of November when the Biden administration ends. And remember, take down the CCP. Thank you. Which I was just on a war room yesterday. And today I'm like, oh, he's, okay, he's being sentenced to four months in prison. You know, it's almost like they're taking these January 6 hearings a little too seriously. Do you think that that's going to backfire for them? I really hope so. And we talk about November 8th and he says November 8th, hopefully this time around and we can hope a little bit when conservatives gain a little power, they would actually do something with it. Hopefully, maybe we can wish for Christmas, right? Christmas wish list. Will the real Slim Shady stand up? Will they actually come and do something with the power? Because there can be a recourse, significant recourse, if we actually have the hood spot to do it. Yeah, I like that you bring that up because what conservative Congress members are actually focusing on the political prisoners that are still being detained from January 6th? I can think of one person off the top of my head, which is Alex's friend, Margaret Taylor-Green, my queen. But no, you know, this is the problem too. And I said this earlier, it's like, even if we get the red wave, it takes time for you to get your legislation passed to get all your policies in order. So I really, truly believe that they're doing a controlled demolition of America right now and that they know there's going to be a red wave and they'll be able to blame, you know, the massive inflation, the energy shortage, the food shortages and say, oh, well, all this happened with your red wave. So now this is a conservative problem and trick the masses. Yeah, John. Two of the red wave, you know, he said something there that I think is true and it's a good rallying point. But the idea that the referendum on the Biden administration is going to be like just us getting out and voting harder. I mean, you're going to need to vote for people who in those positions are going to use them as they are constitutionally permitted to do to basically like go after these people with equal, probably even greater force than they're doing to us. And I mean, even now you're looking at some of the polling and people are getting excited on our side because you've got like GOP up by like three points or something. What does it say about us only having a three point lead with how disastrous this country has become? It's like these people really do believe everything that they're saying they are delusional and they're just importing more and more voters from the third world and eventually our window is going to be shut and it doesn't matter how terrible things get, nothing's going to change. Just like you see in those other third world countries. Well, I want to make this one point and ban and, you know, I know nobody wants to go to jail for four months, but I think that would almost be the best career move for him because it'll make him a mortar, it'll make him, you know, it'll just give him credibility in this whole culture war. Maybe when he's in jail, we're going to slap him with a lot more than that, to be honest with you. Maybe when he's in jail, he writes a book or something about... He loses 40 pounds or something. Yeah, he gets like jacked, he comes out, he's got like a purity, writes a bit. Might be good for him. I mean, I mean, okay, you say that. I like your glass half full opinion, but I just the idea that anyone is serving jail, it's not right, it's not right, the circus is just absolutely insane. It's not right. The way that they've weaponized literally every arm of the government to go after conservatives is just so painfully clear. And it's so frustrating. It's so nice to see someone standing up against it. It's just disgusting. Well, but you also got to make this point. We protested a whole entire summer for George Floyd, yet the FBI is investigating Donald Trump for some classified documents. They never investigated Hillary Clinton. That's what we should be protesting. That's what I mean. We should be out in droves saying, look at the hypocrisy of who they're going after, but all the conservatives just... But to your point, Alex, honestly, this is a concerning... This is a big concerning matter for me as an American, new American citizen, right? Because the culture I come from, you punch a bully in the mouth, you fight. And historically, we don't show up in numbers. We don't organize 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 people to truly, peacefully come and make us stand on the constitutional values we have. We have, we've done that. We didn't hold content accountable for smashing cell phones and using assets, ever. Even when we had the house... And remember, when Trump walked in, Sarah, he had the house and a senate and a white house. And then we just gave up the house. This is my concern. I know we're building business. I know we're the ones keeping this country going. We're employing people. But then, hey, double down. Sleep when you're dead. Show up. Go do something because historically, we haven't. So speaking of the federal government, just kind of using every arm that they can, every lever that they can pull to punish conservatives or anyone who believes in free speech, really, at this point in time, the Biden administration is reportedly considering subjecting Elon Musk's business dealings to national security reviews due to how much power he's acquiring, they say. So they specifically want to scrutinize the Twitter deal and SpaceX's Starlink satellite network. Their interest in Starlink is probably in reference to the letter that Starlink sent to the Pentagon demanding that they fund Ukraine's Starlink internet. And SpaceX's director of government sales wrote in the letter, we are not in a position to further donate terminals to Ukraine or fund the existing terminals for an indefinite period of time. Musk later reversed course and said Starlink will continue to supply Ukraine with free internet. I was, of course, remember after he was put on Ukraine's kill list for like 10 whole minutes, which I'm sure he was sweating bullets, that bull 10 minutes. So as we talk about the conversation with Elon Musk and how the government is targeting him, all of a sudden, scrutinizing his every move, this also comes at the exact same time that he has announced that he wants to fire most of Twitter's employees to bring down some costs. And when I say most, I mean like 75% of them, they currently employ about 7,500 people. And I just, I love it. He's basically like, yeah, you guys all suck. We're going to need to take the trash out and burn it all down to the ground and start fresh. And that's how I'm going to do it. I don't know. It just really feels like government is going after the free speech people. 100%. If you look at the New York Jets right now, it's a really good football team. Historically, a really bad football team. You got to burn it to the ground and then start over. When a new football coach comes in, he fires all staff and you start over. And I said this from the start, you can't fix Twitter. You got to break it down like Bootcamp and rebuild it back up. You're not going to, the wokeness in there. But they're going after him because he's got power and he's not one of them. They didn't go after Bezos, that they go after Zuckerberg ever? When Zuckerberg amassed power? No, of course not. They can't control the guy so then you must stop the guy. Because he may just convince Americans that we're actually free and we should do something with it. I feel like they're really, like they're messing with the wrong person. I'm not, you guys know, I'm not like a huge e-lawn fan. I'm telling you. Yeah, I'm not a huge e-lawn fan, but like he's not going to take this like down. I'm the biggest e-lawn fan. I've had the Tesla sticker on my computer since I started making content because he's just at a certain level of not only being on the spectrum, but also intelligence and wealth. Like the only thing that would ever appeal to this guy anymore are like certain ex-entricities that are like no longer material. So things like being the guy to restore free speech, that is like what he's interested in, even if it's not financially beneficial, even if he's going to be scrutinized by the regime. And you know, he's not like a conservative or anything. I think he's like literally just interested in like, what if I was the guy to do this? And yeah, and Yaku makes a really good point because with any sort of power structure, if it's not functioning towards the ends that it was designed to do, you have to burn it down and rebuild it from the ground up. And so he's going to do that with Twitter. You know, a certain president needs to get into the White House again and do the same thing with the federal bureaucracy. Purge it, replace it with loyalists. Because how else are you going to get anything done if the bureaucracy is staffed by people who are disloyal to your agenda and to the people over whom they have sovereignty? So I've heard that Elon is going to- But that's what Joe Biden is doing. No, exactly. Well, no, that's not true. It was already like that. I mean, the bureaucracy has been the way it's been for decades. That's why Donald Trump gets in and he can somewhat slow what they're doing. But I mean, it's capable of self-sustaining. And it doesn't matter who's following or who's directing the orders. They're going to be the way they are regardless. And so unless you delete aspects of it and replace it with people who are loyal, it's not going to function in a way that's beneficial towards the American people. Moreover, who cares if that's what Biden's doing? And he does it as wrong because he's stupid when we do it, it's good because we're right. Well, it's a different set of motives, right? It's the same tactic. Satan uses the same ploy that works in God's kingdom. I mean, you've got to infiltrate. It's Maslow's hierarchy of needs. You get in and deconstruct to basic needs. So he gets in deconstruct to basic needs to destroy America. You want a president to come in and deconstruct to build America. It's the same set of- And I'm going to get my Twitter back. I think he's saying a week from now the deal goes through. When I get my Twitter back, I'm going Defcon 3 on LibTards. You'll see. I'm going to have the biggest Twitter account in the history of online presence. You will. And I want to say this, listen, I love Elon. I can't wait to get the computer chip in my brain so I can park my Tesla. But to my point, when I'm talking about Elon being an Elon stand, he's going to reduce the employees from 7,500 to roughly 2,000. And the employees that are complaining about it in their internal email say, how are we going to control the misinformation on our platform? I'm like, yes, that's the misinformation again. So going back to the FBI for a second, it's just so fascinating to me that leftists are just so addicted to the government being the ones to take care of them and make all their decisions for them, that they can't fathom when other people don't feel that way. Case in point, a while back, a couple months ago, after all this FBI craziness started surfacing after the Mar-a-Lago raid, I remember a reporter asking Ted Cruz to clarify something because he had made the comments that we should defund the FBI or whatever he had said. But she's like, are you saying that we should defund the FBI? Like, it was like the craziest thing that you could ever hear. And I'm like, I hope that's what he's saying. Like, is that supposed to be taboo? Is he supposed to feel bad for saying that? Absolutely defund the FBI. Is that controversial? I don't understand. No, I think when they talk defund the police, I thought, okay, yeah, let's start with the FBI. Right. Exactly. It's like holding that money and pushing the cops on the street. Exactly. That's kind of that organization. Right. So I want to play it before we have to go to break. I want to play Joe Biden answering a question yesterday. I, a reporter asked him a question. I wish I could tell you what his answer was, but I genuinely don't know. Watch. Tim Ryan in Ohio said he doesn't want you there. Warnock said, wouldn't say. Do you think they're making a mistake? No, they're by 16. You're already gone in for you. I'm more than asked another 20 or so. I'm going to be on it. Play it again. He's playing his facial expression though was so funny. He was in here that isn't a further question. He's like, Oh God, I mean, he's just short circuited again. I know. I know. I know. I will play it again. I love that you noticed that because yeah, he's short circuited and he gets he's so angry that he thinks like if he just makes this like weird fake smile with his eyes really big that it will look normal. Look like Chucky. And he just looks like deer in the headlights. All right. Okay. So we didn't quite make it out the first time. Maybe a second listen, we'll we'll figure out exactly what he's saying. Watch. Tim Ryan in Ohio said he doesn't want you there. Warnock said, wouldn't say. Do you think they're making a mistake? No, they're by 16. You're I've already gone in for you. I know. I'm more than asked another 20. This is about 16. And it was 40. And it was hot. So yeah. Hey. That was bad. I mean, I mean, it had nothing to do with the Warnock. Not wanting him to go to Georgia or Tim Ryan. I want to go to Ohio. Like he didn't even that was the total short circuit failure. I don't I guys, this is the guy who has the nuclear codes. Remember when they used to say that about Trump? They were like, he breathes really loudly. He has a nuclear code. That's scary. He has to walk slowly down a ramp. That's really slippery. That's scary. He held water with two hands. That's bad. Compare that to what we're watching. John, the adults are back in charge. The adults are back in charge. I love democracy. This is what democracy looks like. Literally, I mean, you've got this like shadow government puppeteering everything while you have the cheerleader who's like the senile and competent old man. And then you have the masses all supporting it. Oh, look at my yard sign has aviators on it. Oh, we love Brandon dark brand and stuff like that. It's like dark Brandon because there's no light bulb up there. That's why he's dark Brandon. I got to make this one. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no. Trust me, I get it. But my favorite part of Joe Biden is the only president in United States history as president still calls himself the vice president. Yes. That's humility. That's bad. That's real. And calls the vice president president, by the way. All right. So let's go ahead and take a quick break. We will be back with more first. We want to thank our sponsor home title lock. So it's really scary to have to realize that you are not as secure as you thought you were. And sometimes that realization comes in places you wouldn't expect. Listen to what this cyber thief has to say about his role in committing home title theft. Nobody thinks that I can take their house and borrow against the house. Oh, no, I have title insurance for that. No, it's in my name or he would have to get some special document. They would call me, you know, what he's calling you. After I've stolen the title, borrowed against it or sold the property or done whatever I've done with it, it's 60 to 90 days, even figure out that they're the victim of this crime. You know, by that point, you start getting foreclosure notices and you realize you've got four mortgages on your house. Not only that, you don't even own your home anymore. It's not even in your name. Did you hear him? He was laughing about it. He thinks it's funny. Make sure you aren't a victim before it's too late. Protect yourself and verify your home's title is still even in your name.

Trans Tiktoker, Dylan Mulvaney, who recently appeared on Ulta's podcast that went viral for all the wrong reasons because this dude was talking about girlhood and how he couldn't wait to be a mother someday, which is really, I think he's going to be really sad when someone informs him that he can't actually do that. That's not scientifically possible. He went to the White House to discuss trans issues for an interview that will air this Sunday watch. It's day 222 of being a girl. I'm in Washington, D.C. and I'm going to the White House to speak to the president of the United States. You know that phrase, I fear I may have girl boss too close to the sun. Well, that's how I feel today because I get to sit down with Joe Biden and now this news and I get to ask him a few questions surrounding trans issues in the United States and talk to him about my transness. And I really just want to represent my community the best that I can. And you know what, as silly as I am on here, I'm ready to step up and show that trans people were not going anywhere and that trans kids, they deserve a fighting chance to be their true selves. Okay. Oh my god, I'm running late. Let's go. And y'all are obviously wondering what I'm going to wear to meet the president. Here you go. It's the trans flag colors. Our queen love you. I love you. We're about to go. Is there anything in my team? It is the queen. I'll tell you why. Leaving on cloud nine. The president has watched a piece of growled. It's kind of epic. I'm just trying really hard not to cause our edit team to have to make any, yeah, I'm I know it's right there. The swear to me. It is right there. And I'm going to do my best here. No, you know what? No, I'm not. I'm going to toss it to you guys. I'm going to try to compose myself for a second. That creature that says, I know I'm weird over here and I'm maybe weird. You're equally dysfunctional and in desperate need of help. That is a broken vessel that 100% was sexually abused as a child. That is so discombobulated, has no self identity. Can you imagine if you're the president of the United States and you have to host these kind of conversations today? Maybe you will also look like Joe Biden, dear in the headlights and completely numb because this is a real conversation going on in our culture where the tale is wagging the dog and we're placating to broken people and I'll close with this hurt people hurt people. Okay, nothing about that individual will produce life. It'll produce death. What what trans issues are there, John, what what issues do trans people face that they're having a hard time with because it appears to me that they run society these days? They do not have equitable access to little boys and little girls to put ax wounds or burritos respectively in between their legs with expensive cosmetic surgeries basically. And Iacos exactly right. This is a form of vampirism. These people are vampires. I mean, they are infected by trauma and they pay that forward by praying upon young children and it's disgusting, it's disordered and it's absolutely not normal. And all of the research like every week, the new study shows that this is good new study. There has literally and I and this is I've gone through it. I'm going to do a video about it at some point. There's not one single piece of good data that would suggest that anything about this is normal. But of course, we know that academia is like extraordinarily biased towards the left and so they filter what is funded. They censor certain information. So there's not even a genetic component to this. There is something to be said about men who think they're women having like, disadvantage or I'm sorry, they have equal prenatal testosterone to men who are just normal. But there are there's something to be said about women who believe they're men. They do have some weird discrepancy with the amount of testosterone they're exposed to in the womb compared to normal girls. But this is like literally just an obscure fetish that these people are acting out. I mean, that's what it is. And they are like a fraction of the population, especially when compared to the population that's being affected by the policies of this administration be it for under domestic. But those people have like, not nearly as proportion of representation in the national dialogue. But we're talking so much about trans people and trans kids in particular. Like, oh, these people are just all coming out of the woodwork. All of these kids are trans. If you had a kid who grew up in like Oklahoma on a farm with no internet access, he would never think to himself, oh, I'm actually the other gender. This is something that is completely manufactured and it's anti-natalist because they're trying to make kids gay or trans anything to prevent them from reproducing because they hate children because children are the only thing that gives all of us a purpose in this life ultimately. Yeah. Peter Ducey recently had a viral video where he yelled at Joe Biden and asked him, what's more important inflation or abortion in Joe Biden basically didn't answer. And my point being is like, there are some issues for Americans that are more important than others like inflation, like the fact that we can't buy a single family home. I mean, there's just a litany, you know, all the money that's going to Ukraine. But they have to jam this stuff on our face, all the trans stuff because it's pure mockery. The people that are in control, they want to mock us. And this is what it's doing. It's mocking real women. It's mocking motherhood. It's mocking, you know, the most beautiful thing in the world, the creation of life. Somebody that can't create life and trying to be considered the same as a person that can. It's just, it's not computable. It's impossible. It doesn't work. But they try to create this false reality. And to me, when I see that, they're mocking us by giving him a platform to go in front of Joe Biden when there's so many more issues and so many more important people that need to get in front of him and talk to him. Which is so dumb on their part, I think, because the pendulum swinging back against it is going to, I believe, be very strong and very fierce. Because when you start talking about trans kids and you start talking about, you know, these drag queen brunches that we're going to and you start talking about their clear attempt to sexually indoctrinate our children, parents are not going to take that crap. I can tell you that. And some lawmakers, at least are following suit. I want to give you guys a couple pieces of potential legislation. Virginia State Senator Amanda Chase recently announced plans to introduce legislation to protect children from medicalized gender transitions. Like, sometimes I hear myself say these things and I'm like, I actually can't believe that we have to talk about the fact that we have to introduce legislation to protect children from medicalized gender transitions. Like, this is how far we've fallen in society. The legislation she intends to introduce will be a version of the Save Adolescents from Experimentation Act, first introduced in Arkansas in 2021 to ban gender affirming medical procedures for those under 18. And along with that, the House GOP, no, this is, I'll go off on this in a second. This says, over 30 Republicans in the House of Representatives have proposed a new bill that would prohibit federal funding of programs infused with radical gender ideology like these drag queen story hour events and drag shows aimed at children 10 years old and younger. The bill is called Stop the Sexualization of Children Act. And the problem here is that when I just, I just read to you, House GOP proposes bill. But what I said to you was over 30 Republicans in the House of Representatives. Why? Oh, me. Why? Why is that solo? This is not, this should not be a controversial stance to take as a Republican to stop the federal funding of sexually indoctrinating our children. Like, why are these people in office? Can I tell you why? Please. Because America is the number one nation on Earth commercializing sex with children. 95% of the buyers of sex with children are men. And the fact of the matter is most of our arrests are equally in the Republican party, conservatives and Democrats. You've got people complicit. You've got people inside our party do not frown upon this or they would show up Sarah and they would vote. They would storm the gates. They would literally rescue the child from the gates of hell, but they're not showing up in law enforcement, in legislation. They're not showing up. This is what we do every single day. Pastors aren't showing up. And then I know, when I go to a pastor and I say, can we come in and train your youth? And he's not willing to go, this guy's addicted to porn, the pastor. It's so easy, it's so evident. You protect what you're part of. That's it. Let that penny drop. We have people in our own camp that do not frown upon this. We have to get rid of them, all of them. And retroactively, as they treated January 6 people, every single doctor that performed a double mastectomy on a child should go to jail when we get power back. I love that. Any final thoughts, gentlemen? I think we need to set a higher standard for what a red state actually is. You'll say a headline about, like, red state governor says that liberals need to wait until kids are at least nine to indoctrinate them and we're like epic, oh, and it's like, we have significant majorities in state Congress. You could do this within a week. You could literally have all 26 red states pass laws banning this type of surgery on minors within a week if everybody were actually serious. And I really like that the discussion is focused on this happening to kids, but I fear, because I mean, it's good to appeal to the mainstream of like, this is happening to kids. But at some point, we really are going to have to grow a spine and move the discussion beyond that because I don't think anyone actually believes that if a kid on their 18th birthday got in the car and then went and had one of these surgeries done, that it's like totally okay. There is something deeply wrong with it because it is unnatural and it is disordered and that is targeting children is deeply wrong. But at some point, we're going to have to extend that to its logical conclusion and just say the whole thing is wrong. Otherwise, it's just going to get back to that. And I just want to make this last point. I don't understand how doctors knowing that these people have gendered dysphoria a mental health issue fixing it with the surgery with the physical surgery. They don't care if they're making money off of it, Alex. But it's just so clear that it is a mental health issue. Right. If they would address it, the mental health aspect, be a lot better in my opinion. Yeah. Well, think about all of the follow up visits and the follow up therapy they would, you know, miss out on if they actually corrected the issue mentally. All right, we've got more to come, but we've got to take a quick break. We'll be right back. Bad government and bad policy can literally be deadly. Almost 100 people died in Hawaii's Lahaina fires. The most wildfire fatalities the country has seen in the century. But months on from the event, it seems like the media and local and federal governments would rather we all forget what happened. I'm Lauren Chen and to uncover the truth about that day in the aftermath, including through exclusively obtained 911 calls, the blaze and I travel to Maui for this first ever blaze original documentary.

Earlier this week, Bill Gates appeared on CNBC and said Russia's invasion of Ukraine will actually be good in the long run because it will accelerate the transition to green energy. This seems to be the talking point of all of these climate cultist leaders. We've heard it from the Biden administration. We've heard it from just about all of them. Here is Bill Gates watch. People did get a little optimistic about how quickly the transition could be done. Now without the Russian natural gas being available in Europe, you know, we're it's a setback. You know, we need to find non-Russian hydrocarbon sources to substitute for those. So there's cold plants running and a variety of things because you know, keeping you know, people warm, keeping those economies in decent shape is a priority. Now on the other hand, it's good for the long run because people won't want to be dependent on Russian natural gas. So they'll move to these new approaches more rapidly. He also said in the Breakthrough Energy Summit in Seattle this week that the ultimate measure of success is global greenhouse gas emissions. We need to go from 51 billion tons a year to zero in the next three decades. That sounds reasonable. Yeah, and can't happen. And when he says we have to keep those economies warm until we take them over, until we conquer them. We don't want them to completely implode. And yes, I agree with you, Bill, that they need to walk away from Russian gas and come to American gas and American oil. And you're going to see that day. Wait, you're going to have to eat your shoe because you're going to see the day when the pendulum swings and we're going to drill. We're going to drill in Alaska. We're we are. I'm just waiting for an administration that said, let's go play for real. For once, I tell my kids this, do not play if you don't intend to win. Don't play. It's time we play the win again as America. Well, I know we have enough oil and gas reserves in Texas alone to, you know, basically power the entire world. And we don't take advantage of it. And I think when Doug Mastiano said that they had enough energy in Pennsylvania and you talked about Alaska. So the fact that we're not energy independent, it's like your football analogy, how you got to break it down. That's what Bill Gates wants. He wants us to break everything down to where there's going to be people that are freezing in Eastern Europe because they don't have any power. And he's going to say, Oh, 100 people, 1000 people made that. Well, it was good for the overall, for the big scheme of things. And that's what's so evil about these people is that the means justify the end. So even if the means means killing people or people dying that are innocent, it's justifiable. We're going to humiliate him back. You're going to see the booyan scouts of America march into Bill Gates properties and seize his assets, seize his property, then they're going to be erecting oil drilling apparatuses. We're going to drill for oil on his property. And we're going to lock him in a room with TVs everywhere and like in clockwork orange, and he's going to have to watch is all of his properties are being drilled and we're we're siphoning oil and natural gas and all these things. And then we're just going to use that to build this huge theme park and we're just like going through all these natural resources, just like a big humiliation. I like how this goes. Thanks. And I'm yackos top guy. I like how he thinks. Okay, 10 foil hat time now too. So more market off. I think it was the 10 year or 12 year anniversary of his death. And Libya right now is the only country with actually have open slave auctions. And before we came, we saw he died Hillary Clinton's exact words. More market off. He was using fracking to make Libya a energy independent actually energy provider for all of Northern Africa for a lot of places. So that's the big threat. If any country realizes that they can frack and they can turn their their country into industrious, you know, beneficial to the country. No, they cut the lights out. They cut the power very fast. They don't want anybody else to be able to be independent. So I, you know, Bill Gates, all of these people who AOC, all of these people who are running with this narrative that we're all going to die if we don't do something about the climate are just, I really feel like they need to take some responsibility for all of these crazy climate change cultists who are doing things like gluing their, what are they gluing their hands to the floor in a poor showroom in Wolfsburg, Germany. And then they be, yeah, there they are. This is, well, this really smart guys, but it gets better. They were really upset because Volkswagen told them that they supported their right to protest, but they refused our request to provide us with a bowl to urinate and defecate in in a decent manner while we are glued and have turned off the heating. People in support can't get out of the building. This guy went on to clarify that they were allowed to leave, but would not be allowed to return if they did, obviously. And their demands were that the, well, this is just one of the demands that the German government lower the speed limit to 100 kilometers per hour, which is about 62 miles per hour. And outside, they raised a banner after they threw red paint on the steps of the pavilion. You know, I just like gluing your hand to someone's private property. Probably not a good idea. I'm not sure that if it's my property, I'm going to give you a bowl for anything. See how they were positioned, what in my mind what went through is call the doctors, bring them medical, medical staff, start the car and drive the two arms off. Just drive over the arms and give them medical attention and send them home. That's what flashes through my mind. I mean, you know, it's like, what do you expect them to do when you do that? And they're like, they turned off the heat in this building. It could get cold for us. Okay. Good. Yeah. Like, okay. And they're just, I don't know, they're like waging a war on excellence. And you see this with all sorts of leftist types. Like they're just this very like miserable, gross people, hoarders, mad at anything that's cool. And like those cars that they were sitting in front of, they're never in their lives going to create anything that's even approximately as beautiful or as amazing as those machines. Or be able to afford them. Real. And so there's that aspect. And then too, it's like, it's not even a compelling argument because you people don't have kids and you don't believe in God. So like, what is this all even for? Like, you're living and you want to live so long. So you can just like smoke marijuana and watch porn. It's like, that's not compelling. Like, it's just, you know, oh, the world's going to end and we have to stay here so we can consume more media. And it's like, no, I'd rather just like, you know, assuming even what you're saying about our finite natural resources is true, I'd rather create like prosper societies to cultivate good people than just like participate with your ilk of degeneracy. I have to be devil's advocate. I mean, to be honest, I mean Volkswagen and Porsche as a man that defecates in a bowl. And it's every time it's really not that much to ask. And on top of that, do you, do you defecate in a bowl in a decent manner? Yeah, it's most decent. Yeah. Well, not all the time. It depends on what I ate for dinner. But my point, if they really wanted to bring up a social issue, Volkswagen was created by Adolf Hitler, you know, they don't want to do it. They don't want to talk about that. They don't want to talk about the creator of Porsche and, you know, obviously Porsche came from Volkswagen. And they're not protesting that. That that company's still successful. And, you know, they got in a huge scandal because they were tricking the testing so that they could have more diesel fumes. So like, I see why they went after him because they got in trouble with fraud or the climate change stuff. But if they really want to bring awareness to it, why don't they say, Hey, you know, Adolf Hitler started this car brand. I think that would do more damage to the car brand and put them, you know, hurt their business more than just gluing your hands to a tile floor. Right. But what's the deal with the hands you had, you had, you had girls in the loop to a painting and a side of a painting, painting, which by the way, we talked about it. And I was like, I don't, I knew, I'm like, I don't feel like the oil that was used in that is like the oil that they're protesting. And, of course, it was not maybe we should skip like, because you have all these people coming in from the Middle East as refugees. Maybe we should skip the part where they're just like taking over low levels of position and just, you know, right to the top. And then you've got that and they'll just cut people's hands off like, you're not supposed to do it. And they're bam, hand off. Oh, you said something that's like, blasphemous, rip your tongue out. Like that would almost be more effective in a be it barbaric way. But like, I mean, you'll do it once or twice. Well, they say it's Saudi Arabia. Yeah, and they say in Saudi Arabia, you can just like leave your keys in your Ferrari because they'll cut your hand off if you're still in high trust society. You can't come in Singapore. I'm driving from the airport to the hotel and the taxi driver says, sir, you didn't bring any gum, did you? And I go, no, because I know they'll arrest you if you chew gum, because you throw gum on the go, no, look, we can we can tighten the reins a little bit, your Alex. We did this a little bit. Just make an example. The next pedophile, the rape a child, you're just making it. It's only got to happen a couple of you know, there was a couple of times called I think the case for flogging. And they made a very interesting case to bring back like beating people in public. And basically, who are bringing? Yeah, and it's like, I mean, you know, it's I guess maybe an archaic idea, but it makes a good point. That was explained. Or if you're a freak like me, I like to get spooky. If you're going to prison for the rest of your life, at that point, you're just transferring the burden from being a burden to the public to being a burden on their tax dollars. So why not just, you know, quick execution or whatever, quick beating in public, you know? All right, we, I'm sure you all have more to say on the subject, but we're gonna have to take a quick break. We'll be right back. We were talking about the January 6th committee and Steve Bannon earlier breaking news as of the time of this taping, of course, that the the US House committee investigating all of this has formerly formally issued a subpoena to former President Donald Trump today. And within their letter, they make, of course, numerous allegations against him saying that he purposely and maliciously disseminated false allegations of fraud related to the 2020 presidential election in order to aid his effort to overturn the election and for purposes of soliciting contributions. Let's see, without any evidentiary basis, illegally pressured state officials and legislators to change the results of elections in their states, orchestrating an overseeing an effort to obtain and transmit false electoral certificates to Congress and the National Archives, filing false information under oath in federal court, sending a social media message to the nation at 2.24 PM while knowing full well that the violent attack on the Capitol was occurring, in which you incited further violence by publicly condemning your vice president and refusing for hours to disband your rioting supporters by instructing them to leave the Capitol while you watch the attack unfold on television. I feel like it should be signed with so there because that's about how I feel like they're acting when I read this. Okay, so does Trump, does he go and does he make the biggest mockery and scene of this committee? Because I'm rooting for that. I want it at this point. I want him to sit and just be completely belligerent and uncooperative and make them look very stupid. I don't think you see him go Alex Jones on him, like be belligerent. But I do think if he shows up and his lawyer's job right now is to find a way for him not to show up. That's their job, okay, for him not to be exposed like that. But if he had to show up, I do think he does what he did into debates. He rules the room and he takes over the room and just kindly just exerts. Does he do anything kindly? A little pressure. Yeah, he does. He says, I'm a nice guy. I'm a nice guy. He's a nice guy. Kindly coming and just exerts pressure and commands the room by interrupting. But I didn't think he goes Alex Jones on him. I don't think he's going to Liz Cheney a little bit and make fun of her dad for killing a million Muslims. That'd be funny. Okay, so here's another one that summoning tens of thousands of supporters to Washington and knowing they were angry and some were armed sending them to the Capitol. How did he knew that some of them were armed? It's just like, he refused to disband his supporters. Okay, so they would have been so pissed if he showed up. So they would have just completely crucified him if he showed up to his supporters at the Capitol. But also they're trying to hammer him on refusing to do like, how's he going to how's he going to disband them? Show up. How do you communicate to them while they're in while people are there? You think they'll just quit or a while? You know, this novel, this fictional novel is a fictional novel that lives on the fictional Isle of Born's a noble. I mean, it's bad, John. They corroborated like with their entire media syndicate to incite riots the summer prior to that, which did billions of dollars in damage, took objectively more lives than were taken on January 6th. Also, that same stock of people has rioted in state capitals, and they did the same thing in DC when Trump was first inaugurated. Even that aside, no one actually believes that Donald Trump has the political sever fair to actually stage a coup. No one actually believes he knows what's necessary to actually steal an election and take power. He was just rightfully criticizing some certain incongruencies, which maybe we're worth looking into. But yeah, it's just a total joke. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, he just kind of looked at Trump. I'd love to see him get in there and just for the must see TV aspect of it. But sadly, if Trump didn't even have pints on his side and they actually think the QAnon shaman was going to go in there with two horns and de-certify an election, you're mentally insane. Well, and it's I just think it's important for perspective to continue to remind everyone, they still voted to certify it four hours after this. Yes. How bad was this attack that they were still able to go in and do what they showed up to do four hours later? And Trump would be able to expose that very well. People, because we take him for granted, he is so good at winning the favorability of the public. And like, people forget that he went up in 2015 and there was all this talk about all these rising Republican stars, Bobby Jindal and Marco Rubio, Scott Walker. And he just destroyed them. I mean, it was like, and say Jeb Bush, I mean, you're talking about like A-list GOP figures. Like he just like destroyed them. And now, when's the last time you've heard about what they're doing? Like you happened. And the same thing, he gets up on the debates against Hillary Clinton and just blows her out of the water because you'd be in jail. Like, it was incredible. That's why I wanted this. I want to watch this. I feel like after the last two years, we deserve it. That's such a good point, Sarah, because people forget how important it is to have a president who's like funny in the White House. Ronald Reagan, look at the morale of this country in the 80s. It was fantastic. And that, you know, flowed into the 90s. Donald Trump was funny. Like, we really believed that the best days were ahead because we could turn on the television and see a guy was like, that's funny. He called like Kim Jong Un fat, like implicitly. He said that my big red nuclear button is bigger than yours. That's hilarious. And now you've got Joe Biden who's like, it's funny, but in a much more disturbing way. Right. All right. We got to take another quick break. We'll be right back. It is funny. And that really weird way. Earlier this week, Stacey Abrams celebrated record voter turnout. But of course, also claimed voter suppression still exists. Worked out went out in your headwatch. But yesterday we saw record turnout for early voting. Yes, we should be excited. But let's remember what that means. It does not mean that voter suppression doesn't exist. That's like saying that there are no more sharks in the water because more people get in. We know the impression is alive in Georgia, but we're stronger, we're faster, and we're better than it. And we are going to bring it and we're going to win this election. No, honey, you're not fast at anything. I don't think you are fast at anything. I'm going to tell you that right now. You roll slow. You're not fast at anything. If they were like voter suppression, that'd be like a very coordinated and sophisticated operation. Wouldn't that require a greater level of intelligence than something like just getting a driver's license? Yeah. Because they also were like, oh, well, that's racist because black people don't know how to get driver's licenses. But yet they know how to somehow like circumvent voter suppression. Well, they also like are constantly saying every the election was real. And there's no possible way that that they could ever mess with people's votes and voter suppression isn't real. Only in 2016, not in 2020. Only 2016 and a whole bunch of times before that. And Hillary still doesn't accept that she lost the election. Right. Voter suppression is real, but also it's not real, but also. I think she's going to run again. What if she runs again? Hillary? Yes. One of her big advisor said so. Then we're going to get her to do some anti-crisis. Our president."
