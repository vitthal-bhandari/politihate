Friday edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show starts right now. Clay taking a day off. Be with the family. I'm in solo today. It is a Friday. So let's kick those lines wide open 800 282 2 882. We've got a lot to dive into together. Even White House officials starting to leak to some outlets that they're kind of worried about the fact that Joe Biden can only have meetings during a few hours a day. And Joe Rogan waited on the Biden situation. You're going to want to hear that sound bite from him in just a little bit. Randy Winegarden, the chief commissar of the teachers unions lying so much on the issue of school closures yesterday. And just the whole thing is meant to rewrite history. These people who were so thuggish and vicious and nasty Democrats in their shutdowns, continued shutdowns of schools. You know, I know they try to muddy the waters by saying, well, look at all these people who shut down and shutting down in March of 2020 is not the same thing as shutting down in September of that year. And then January of the following year. And then the following September, we will discuss some of this in just a little bit. Also, you know, we had that RFK sit down or I should say interview. Wasn't really they weren't sitting down with each other. But we had the RFK interview yesterday with Clay. He went on ABC News. And guess what? They're still doing the we cannot allow these false claims to be aired on our station. So we will discuss that. I've got a I've got a bit of breaking news. And then some likely to be breaking news that I can speak to you about later today. Let's start with what has happened that you need to know about or what is in progress right now. Remember when there was that moment of the banks looking real shaky and Silicon Valley Bank was in need of a federal intervention. They can call it whatever they want. It's a bailout of some kind. Right. Otherwise, the bank was just going to go under and depositors were going to be left. Well, without their deposits. Remember when that happened? And then first Republic Bank had a really shaky moment. The Biden administration, of course, assured us right away. They said, don't worry about it. Everything's going to be just fine. We've got this covered, you know, where we've got the smartest people in the whole financial and economic world. Working for Joe Biden, you know, like Janet Yellen and Pete Buddha judge and look at the cabinet that he's picked. But OK, put that aside for a second. Put that aside. The first Republic bank right now has seen its shares drop 50%. And is likely, according to CNBC, to go into FDIC receivership. So so let's just do a quick review here. There was a series of bank failures. They said that don't worry. We have we have stopped the bleeding here financially. We have we have stopped the free fall of these banks and then the cascading effect, the domino effect. What can happen next? People get really freaked out about this, right? Because it affects the money that you put in the bank. This is a big deal, understandably. Biden said, don't worry about it. Don't worry about it, Bob. Jack, buddy, we got it covered, right? That's what Biden was telling you. You know, we're going to get to make the banks stable. When he does the creepy whisper, you know, you're in a much better place. And turns out the banks are non-stable or least first Republic bank is not stable. I don't know. I can't look at the balance sheets of all these banks. I don't know what they did and how on the wrong side of the interest rate rise they've gotten. But you know, we all sit around and say, hey, what could trigger a descent into a clear and rough recession? It's something like this. It's a bank that is on the edge of failure or perhaps additional banks that will now be shown to be shaky and on the edge of failure. That, my friends, is how you can find yourself in the midst of a recession so bad that Biden and Karine Jean-Pierre and the whole White House apparatus will have to say to you, oh, yeah, we messed this thing up. This isn't a bad one. They won't admit that they did it, but they'll say this is not good. The economy is in a in a bad place. So I'm not sure that's going to happen. It might take a little while longer. I hope it doesn't happen because a recession means job losses. It means economic anxiety and even destruction for people. That can mean the end of businesses and people's dreams being shattered. Recession is an ugly thing, but it increasingly looks like it is inevitable based on the policies and based on the decision making that we have seen from the people who are in charge in this White House and what they've been doing and how they have been operating up to this point. And now I want to I want to I want to transition for a second here. I want to transition and talk to you about what is going on in Nashville with regard to the manifesto, right? So the Nashville, um, trans shooter manifesto we are told is likely to be released there. The police are saying it will be released at some point. The police are saying that there will be a, um, there'll be a manifesto that you'll be able to see. Now I don't know what's in it, but I want to get a little bit ahead of this because here's my first of all, it's this story has been the last 24 hours. Um, this story has been the last 24 hours and we don't have a definitive timeline of it. But what we do have is the promise now from the Nashville police that it will be released. Right. That's what we're being told. Okay. Why has it been delayed this long? I want to get ahead of this because while I don't know what's in it, I do know what the likely motivations are for holding this back. And, um, I think it's most likely what you'll see is they didn't want people to know. Um, they didn't want people to know that this individual was a radicalized member of the trans community and was by academic definition of what constitutes a terrorist, a trans terrorist, somebody who felt that, uh, that she came from and aggrieved and besieged community that was suffering because of laws passed in Tennessee, for example, that we're going to prevent gender transition for minors. That's what I think is likely to be in there. I don't know, but here's what I'm telling you. If they release this thing in the next few hours, which they might, maybe not even while I'm on the air here, but if they release this on it, this would be the classic document dump on a Friday, right? Trying to bury the story as much as they can. Now maybe they hold it the next week. We don't know what the timeline is going to be, but understand that it is very likely in my mind that the reason for the delay was because the, uh, impact, the psychological impact and the calls for accountability are very different. Will be very different based on the motive at this point in the national conversation than they would have been and say a few days or even a week or so after the horrific, uh, mass shooting and killed six innocent individuals, including three tiny nine year old kids, they withheld this information. I would be willing to, to bed. I mean, I'm, I'm quite sure this is the rationalization for it. We'll see. I'll tell you if I, if it turns out that I'm wrong and there was nothing in this, um, but think about it this way, even if it's complete, uh, if it's, if it's gibberish, even if it is essentially completely and I'm sorry, the fire alarm has gone off around me. So you were wondering why I'm having, it's okay though. Everything's fine. There's no fire in the building. They're telling me. So if I sounded like I got thrown off there for a second, it's because someone's, they're shouting over the PA system, the firewall on anyway. Um, even if you were to find out that the, uh, the gibberish that could be in the man, I see gibberish. It's just the rantings of a crazy person. The, the lunacy that could be, uh, underway, uh, that, that was obviously underway, but the lunacy that you could be seeing that is completely impossible to decipher in a meaningful way. If that is the case, if that is the case, um, it's still, I believe a choice that was made politically by the Biden FBI and by the powers that be to withhold this from the public so that people won't have the ability, uh, didn't have the ability, I should say, to go through this and understand exactly what was going on and to focus on it less. Right. So just the manifesto existing would be a point of media focus, just the manifesto being there, um, out in the open for people would mean there's more conversation and the incident would get more attention and people would start to draw more parallels. They would say things like hold on a second. There'd been a couple of other mass shootings or attempted mass shootings involving individuals who seem to have become radicalized members of the trans community. What's happening here? Is it possible that the narrative that the democrat corporate media pushes on a regular basis that, uh, they're, the trans community is under constant, you know, mortal threat from all these, all these horrible bigots everywhere that there is a genocide and that is a term that Democrats will use a genocide of some kind underway against the trans community. And you say, how is that possible that they would say that because they believe the erasure of trans identity is the destruction of an individual in such a way that it's tantamount to a genocide. Think about that. I mean, this is, I understand we're going through some, some levels deep into the levels of crazy here. Um, but this is, this is why they've held it back up to this point. This is why they've decided, uh, they decided to go with it. So we'll see if they release it today. If I do, I'll analyze it. I'll read through as much as I can analyze it in real time. Um, I want to bring you into what the latest is on, uh, Biden from his own staff also want to hear from all of you, 800-282-2882 and sorry there, just so you know, it's, you got to be a real radio pro and you have three fire alarm announcements go off in your ear while you have a live radio show going. So I hope, I hope that I was able to push through that as, as well as possible because I had, and I hope you weren't able to really hear it, but there were very loud PA telling me that there was, uh, no fire. I know there's no fire, but you said it a few times. So we'll get into all this 800-282-2882.

Join me for the Carol Markowitz Show, new episodes dropping every Monday and Thursday on the iHeartRadio app, Apple Podcasts or wherever you get your podcasts. You know they are trying really hard to convince you that Joe Biden is totally normal at this stage of the presidency. He's fine. What do you mean? Do you think that he's not up for the job? What do you mean? You think that Joe Biden is too old? Don't be crazy. Just get ready for all the gaslighting because it's only going to go in one direction here. For example, it is apparently according to the White House press secretary totally normal for a president when he is going to be doing a press conference for the first time in, gosh, three months. It's totally normal for him to have not only the name and photo handy of the people he's calling on. Remember the White House press corps largely the same people who were there day in and day out. And anyway, but beyond that, that the whole question should be written out for him in advance so he can know what they're going to ask him because you know, that's how you speak truth the power. Here is KJP telling you this is totally normal. Nothing to see here. Play six is entirely normal for a president to be briefed on reporters who will be asking questions at a press conference and issues that we expect they might ask about. It is not surprising that yesterday we would anticipate questions that he did receive right on the visit with the South Korean president as South Korean president was sitting standing to his to his right or about 2024. That was completely expected or about the debt ceiling, which he took questions at the end, shouted questions at the end. And of course, we would note those issues to him, those issues to him likely come up. Yeah, you see what they're trying to tell you is, oh, we just perfectly anticipated the questions he was going to be asked by those people at that time. That's what she's telling you. Does anyone believe that? I just want to know. Does anyone think that's true? Oh, but what else are they going to tell you? This is all just a farce that Joe Biden, as we stand here on the precipice of what feels like could be the beginning of a massive recession, which will change the political landscape for 2024 in massive ways. If it does happen, that Joe Biden is going to improve with time that he's going to see more with it. I've told you this a million times they don't care, but they also recognize that this is a it is a heavy lift. They don't care that Joe Biden is incapable of doing what needs to be done as a president as a leader because they figure the system around him will govern in his place, which is true. But they also recognize at some level the numbers that show that there's such a weak level of support for Joe Biden. That could be a political issue for them. And then there's this Joe Rogan, who has a very very large podcast over on on this whatever Spotify. Here he is saying that, well, this is what he says. Listen, the fact that he's running again is so wild. When you watch him talk, the fact that there's no leadership that can find a solution to this, because there really is no solution. I mean, we've answered about it. You and I and a lot of other people have as well, like, what are they going to do? Like, what is what is the other than Biden dying? Like very soon. And then someone stepping up in a big way. That's pretty much the analysis that I think everyone's coming to right now, which is if Biden is is alive for the duration of this race. And we certainly hope that, you know, Biden is healthy and fine. But other than the only way that they're going to replace him would be if he had, let's say, a health issue that just meant that it was clear he couldn't go forward at all, which would have to be something very severe. Because right now it's obvious that he is in deterioration. But there is something that is really undermining here about the whole system, about what this does to the whole system. It makes people feel like politics in this country has become a joke and that. Serious people are the ones who are making our most serious decisions. And that's really, really troubling for those of us who want what's best for the country. But Democrats just want to be in charge. They just want power. Everything else is a secondary consideration at best. And you see this with the way they're rolling out. Biden 2.0 will come back, talk a bit about Randy, Winegarten in just a second here and the school closures. If you own a business, you know the value of time. Getrefunds.com does too. That's why they've been it easy and quick to apply for the Employee Retention Credit or ERC. Go to Getrefunds.com to get started in less than 10 minutes. See if your business qualifies for ERC assistance. Your business may be eligible for a payroll tax refund of up to $26,000 per employee kept on payroll during COVID-19. Getrefunds.com has already helped clients claim over $3 billion in payroll tax refund through the ERC. They may be able to help your business too. There's no upfront charge either. They don't get paid until your business gets its refund. So many businesses think they won't qualify based off of incomplete or outdated information. Don't let this opportunity pass you by. Go to Getrefunds.com. This tax refund is only available for a limited time. So act now. Go to Getrefunds.com. Teasers unions should be abolished. Start with that one. Think about this. You have a public sector employees who are able to demand increasing benefits from the Democrat apparatus in whatever city they're in or whatever very blue area they're in with almost no pushback whatsoever. The Democrats go, great. We'll take more taxpayer money. We'll raise property taxes. We'll spend more money to hire more administrators. Not even teachers. We'll hire more administrators to just make it as bloated and inefficient a system as possible. And then the teachers unions say, yeah, and we don't want any accountability. We don't want any metrics. We want to be able to still have failure be acceptable within the system. So we want a lot of administrators. We want no metrics. We want bare minimum requirements of us. And you also have these tenure systems. I mean, the whole thing, it's all these different scams. It should be, you want to be a public school teacher? Okay. The district says this is where we're going to pay you. This is the deal. And boom, you go. You take the job. You don't take the job. That's it. That's how this should be. Right? There was no, when I went into the CIA, there was no like, there was no union that I was a part of that was demanding more and more pay and more and more benefits. But this is crazy. The whole thing is absurd on its face. But this is also, unfortunately, because of the concentration of power you see in these teachers unions, that's why they were able to get away with just the horrific school closures across the country. Now, I understand that schools are basically now all open. And for a lot of people that want to move on past this, I don't want to be able to do what I want to move on because who has lost their job? Who has been held accountable for the emiseration, the psychological duress, the insanity inflicted upon children so that either hysterical or lazy or a combination of both adults represented by the teachers unions didn't have to go in and do their jobs hysterical because, oh, my gosh, COVID really? All those, you know, 25 to 45 year old grammar school teachers and high school teachers represented by these unions. It was two dangers for them to do their jobs. The clerk at the store around the corner from me, you know, the grocery store employees, they showed up. They did their jobs. They made sure that there was somebody there to run the store so we could buy food and people buy medicine. But no, no, too dangerous for the teachers. They told us, well, this is all a scam. It's a scam because Randy Winegarden was, as we know, as a matter of record, in direct contact with Rachel Wielenski, which came out, she actually even said on under oath that she had Rachel Wielenski's door, you know, the director of a CDC, she had her private phone number. Why is the head of the teachers union have the cell phone number of the head of the CDC? That's kind of a random thing, isn't it? I don't have the head of the CDC's phone number and I work in media. Seems a little strange, doesn't it? Okay. And then also, well, well, Wielenski, but in this case, Winegarden was working directly with the Biden White House to set policy and essentially say, look, we are, this is what it really was about. Our teachers like staying home and getting their full pay. So we're all going to pretend that it's so scary for them. It's not safe. It's not safe so that they can stay home and get paid. And this is where the unions, the teachers unions are flexing their muscle. And you know who suffers kids, the children. I've seen Randy Winegarden pull this routine before, by the way, oh, it's all about the kids. It's about doesn't give it does not give a, you know what about what was done to children about the forest masking about the putting plexiglass dividers around them in schools, putting them in these plastic bubbles. Has it apologized for any of that? Just goes, oh, we were so scared. Well Scott Jennings is a Republican commentator over at CNN. And I mean, this honestly, I don't even know they had any over there at this point, but apparently they're a couple. And he had an opportunity to lay down some truth last night on CNN when it came to Randy Winegarden and her demands for school closures and the insidious effect she had on children during the pandemic. And here is Mr. Jennings laying it down. Play it. We don't know each other. But speaking on behalf of millions of American parents, I have four at home. I had to teach them at home. My wife had to teach them at home. I am stunned at what you have said this week about your claiming to have wanted to reopen schools. I think you'll find that most parents believe you were the tip of the sphere of school closures. There are numerous statements you made over the summer of 20 scaring people to death about the possibility of opening schools. And I hear no remorse whatsoever about the generational damage that's been done to these guys. I have two kids with learning differences. Do you know how hard it is for them to learn at home and not in a classroom that was designed for them and for you to sit in front of Congress and the American people and say, Oh, I want to open them the whole time. I am shocked. I'm stunned. I'm stunned. And there are millions of parents who feel the exact same way. There are millions of them. I hope that will who will remember this because there has been no accountability for this whatsoever. And the teachers unions are nothing but downside for kids across the country. Those unions exist in America for their protection of adults who vote Democrat and donate to the Democrat party. That is it. It has nothing to do with the kids. The kids are not a consideration for the American Federation of Teachers in these other places ever. You'll notice that, right? It's never about what's best for the any time. There's a big issue at all. There's a walkout or there's, you know, there's some, some, you know, protests going on or something. It's never, Hey, you know, we need to do something. It's better for the kids. It's always, Oh, we want more pay. We want more time off. We want more administrators to do more of the administrative load without even adding to the number of students in some of these schools. The whole thing, it is a scam. It's a scam. But because it benefits the Democrat party so much, I mean, you look at what happens in cities like New York and Los Angeles and Chicago, you can't be the mayor without the teachers unions. De Blasio, who single-handedly did more than anyone thought was even possible to destroy New York City understood this. Other mayors understand this. You need those teachers unions to mobilize for you. And you know, somehow you'll notice there's never any interest in, Hey, are they, are they organizing on, on school time? You know, or are they doing things that break the, the contract of what they're supposed to do, which is focus on children in the day and really do political activity? No, no, looking into that. No, come on. In fact, they'll tell kids it's time for a walkout, time for a protest when the city is supposed to be paying them, but the city won't do anything because it's all Democrat. It's all one party nonsense. You know what's going on. But I was happy to see somebody at least say the truth or any wine garden. What was done to your children during the COVID pandemic by people who claim to care the most about their interest within the system was an abject betrayal. And this is a, a, as clear as day, a Democrat, a Democrat issue. This is something that the parties where, you know, Republicans were the ones saying, come on, let's open up, let's open up, open up the schools. Democrats were the ones saying, no, it's not safe. We have to keep them shut down. And children suffered as a result of this. I mean, think of the, the mentality as well of these schools that were forcing masks on the kids. I haven't, I haven't forgiven these people. Would you forgive people for child abuse outside of the context of COVID? If they, if someone, if someone in the school system had abused your kid in 2019, would you say, oh, well, you know, it's been a couple of years. Absolutely not. You would want justice. You'd be outraged, right? So why is it then that we're supposed to forget that these absolute imbeciles, Randy Wine Garden and Marcel Walensky and Joe Biden, go to the list and Dr. Fauci and all of them, were sitting there and advocating for policies, not only for the school shutdowns, but then for the policies in school that included children in New York City in 35 degree weather, were being told they had to sit on the ground outside and mask up between bites. I mean, I have to wonder at what point does, at what point do Democrats realize what a bunch of so sociopaths they turned into over this issue? At what point do they realize that they were like a step away from saying, we're just going to, you know, lock these kids up in a cell, maybe bring them some, you know, stale bread crusts after a few days and a little bit of water. I mean, it was completely, completely unhinged. Oh, but, you know, a lot of the guy, I hear the stats. I read the stats. Oh, all these suburban moms in these close states, oh, threats to our democracy. They abused your kids. What's more important that or threats to democracy? Because CNN is hyperventilating about Donald Trump again. We see, you know, I refuse to let this go because not only have they not apologized for it, there's no accountability. So just put that aside for a moment. And the only accountability can come at the ballot box. That's and not, that's not full, but that's partial accountability, right? But beyond that they haven't even said we were wrong. We're sorry. Randy Winegard and hasn't even apologized what she did to your kids. She's still posing like she's some kind of hero, vile commissar of the Democrat union system in the schools. It's appalling what she did has no, no feelings about this at all. Then you know, we did what we had to do and we're still in charge and we're still going to collect donations for Democrats. And we're still going to make sure that there's nothing but excuse making for the abject failure of so many, not all, but so many of the public school systems, particularly in major cities all across the country, just constant excuse machinery. We need more administrators. Oh, okay. That's going to fix it. 800-282-2882.

It is interesting to see how the legacy media treats RFK Jr. and he was on ABC News, which you know, it's still these different channels, CBS, ABC, either that have these evening news shows, they still get a lot of viewers. Not as many as they used to, obviously. They used to be dominant and they had no competition, but there are millions of people watching these shows every night, which is mind-blowing to me. But I, you know, I worked my first ever, ever internship. And you notice that the internship scam has kind of fallen off a little bit for a lot of now there are good internships. I don't mean that. But when I was coming up in the ranks in the mid late 90s, an internship was you showed up, got no money, no school credit, nothing. You were just in an office and basically doing the most menial grunt work possible for free. I remember I had a friend whose dad who was an original partner at Goldman Sachs, who told me, he's like, you guys should, he said this to me and his son. He said, you guys should just go get jobs that pay you money. Like go make sandwiches in the summertime or go, you know, you know, yard work, roofing, whatever. Like go do a thing that gets you paid. But there was this whole time where, oh, I'll never get a job unless I do a fake job. Right. So I did that at CBS, the evening news. I did get school, some school credit for it to be fair. But I remember being there, I'm like, Dan Rather is Dan Rather is a buffoon and what why are people? But it's it was habituated, right? People had gotten used to it. So they still have this footprint. They still have this, this voice on TV at night, these NBC ABC CBS. Anyway, RFK Jr. was doing a ABC. I didn't even know who hosts ABC news shows and I paid almost no attention to those networks. But he went on one of them. Obviously, we had a great interview with Clay and RFK Jr. yesterday. But notice how and you know, Clay shows him full respect. Cause first of all, anybody who spoke the truth over COVID about COVID, there's a camaraderie, right? There's a little bit of a, Hey, you're on our team on this, you know, you know, even I'm sure Alex Behrenson disagrees in the on a whole host of political issues, but on COVID, I was like, this guy gets it. And he knew that I got it too. I saw what was going on. I was one of the very, very earliest conservatives to come out and just say, this is all completely insane. I mean, I wanted to open up in April of 2020, by the way, that was where I was like, this is what are we doing with this lockdown stuff? Anyway, so RFK Jr goes on to ABC news. And here is, here's how that went. They said, but play, play clip one. You've said in the past that there is a correlation between vaccines leading to autism. It's totally been debunked. Wait a minute. Who debunked it? We have not seen any kind of scientific connection from the CDC, the World Health Organization, the national organizations are captive agencies, Lansing. And so you think they're all in coves? Yeah, they're all captive. If you don't regard the same scientific authorities, science is rarely static. There are very few scientific principles that are immovable. Science is dynamic. Let me just say his point that science is dynamic is absolutely true and that it is constantly evolving hypotheses and data and evidence and that that is the core of a scientific method, which was perverted by Fauci and the rest of the Democrat apparatus during COVID. But let me just say, notice how she she comes at him with this. And it's not even about COVID vaccines. It's about other vaccines and she's a let she's saying that he alleges there's a link to autism. If you're going to just tell somebody on air as this woman is doing, you're totally wrong and lying. You have to be able to bring more to it. Whatever you think of that, by the way, you have to bring more to it than just say, because the smart people say so, right? You have to actually be able to explain why what RFKG you're saying, you know, point to what are the studies and by the way, maybe that I'm not even weighing in on it. I'm just saying there needs to be at least some follow through beyond you're wrong because she would never do that to the Russia collusion is she would never do that to people that's about all kinds of lives. But note, this is what she did after he was done on air and can't defend himself at all. Play to we should know that during our conversation, Kennedy made false claims about the COVID-19 vaccines data shows that the COVID-19 vaccines prevented millions of hospitalizations and deaths from the disease. We also made misleading claims about the relationship between vaccination and autism. Research shows that vaccines and the ingredients used for the vaccines do not cause autism, including multiple studies involving more than a million children and major medical associations like the American Academy of Pediatrics and the advocacy group Autism Speaks. We've used our editorial judgment and not including extended portions of that exchange in our interview. We thank you, Mr. Kennedy. Okay. Okay. Okay. We don't even know what he said because they edited it out. They edit out some of what he said. And then after he's not there to defend himself, they say he's wrong and he's lying to you. We just want you to know that and you can't hear this stuff. And here's the part for me. I'm not focusing on the latter part of the claim, but on the COVID-19 vaccines, it is completely bonkers to suggest that COVID-19 vaccines save millions of lives in this country. The evidence for that is completely wishful thinking. He's got a point about the corporate media, doesn't he? Judy was boring. Hello. Then Judy discovered Chumba Casino dot com.
