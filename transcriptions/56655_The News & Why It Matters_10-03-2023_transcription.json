    "text": " Today, mom Colin Kaepernick is whining that he's oppressed again. Also, Joe Biden releases his new budget plan, and of course it focuses on transgenderism and Congress pushes journalists to reveal their sources in the Twitter files. We've got all of that coming up and more, and it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. It is Friday. Happy Friday. While Colin Kaepernick must have noticed he had become largely irrelevant and in an attempt to change that, he's come out with a new graphic novel called Change the Game. Cap is making the usual press circuit in order to peddle his books, and when he sat down with CBS yesterday, he made quite the accusation about his adoptive parents' watch. I love how you depict yourself in this book, not as some big shot hero, but as a shy, insecure high schooler like we all were. I mean, I'm speaking for you, but... Absolutely, absolutely. Growing up, I was a... I think still I'm a pretty introverted person. I hope it's true to form, and that's just kind of how I navigate the world. It's his true high school coming of age story, his journey embracing his blackness despite resistance from many, including his white adoptive parents. I know my parents love me, but there were still very problematic things that I went through. I think it was important to show that no, this can happen in your own home and how we move forward collectively while addressing the racism that is being perpetuated. He took cues from his icon, basketball star Alan Iverson, who he said wore his blackness like a suit of armor, and teenage Kaepernick wanted cornrows to match. He's getting what roles his mom asked? Oh, your hair's not professional. Oh, you look like a little thug. You're wrong. Become. So that too. Yeah. And those become spaces where it's like, okay, how do I navigate this situation now? But it also is informed why I have my hair long today. Mm, mmm, mmm, okay. All right, let me get the straight. So the white parents who chose him, who chose him, who spent presumably like a substantial amount of money to adopt him, to raise him in a good home, to provide shelter, ooh, on the plate, everything he needed. They're racist because they thought his hairstyle looked stupid. You know what I would say? What I would say, if my, my children, my, my older son came to me and he said he wanted to grow his hair out into like a mullet or something. I would say you shouldn't do that because it looks stupid and unprofessional, but I guess because they're white and they use the term thug, they must be racist. And by the way, they must be doing racism way wrong because they kind of dedicated their life to taking in this young black infant who was abandoned by his black father. By the way, they raised him. They gave him every advantage in life. It's really no wonder why no team wants this guy who by the way, let's be clear. I like to always set the record straight here. He sucked so bad. He had already been bench for Blaine Gabbard before he started kneeling and subsequently left the NFL. Now I have two people at this table, one of whom I think might have a little bit to say about this situation. I'd like to welcome to the program both Eric July, Blay Stevie contributor and founder of Ripa First Comics and Alex Stein, Blay Stevie host of prime time with Alex Stein. Now, for those of you who are watching, I'll state the obvious that Eric is black, right? He is a black man in America. He also, of course, is very familiar with graphic novels because he has created his own company, Ripa First Comics, which contributes to the parallel economy because he got tired of all of this wokeness. Like I imagine, you would have find this to be from Colin Kaepernick, this revisionist history of his life that he was oppressed somehow by his white parents and put it all in this graphic novel. Well, it's just interesting timing because none of that ever can't seem to come up until now. There was no stories, no documentation that he was, there was any sort of abuse, any sort of trauma that was being like, let's say put upon him by way of his adoptive parents. That never was a thing until now. And it's a little advantageous considering the type of story that he's trying to tell and the type of person that he's trying to present himself as, which again, I always think this is ironic because it seems to come from people that have just as much white in them as they do black. I'm not, I know that we can talk about this colorism thing, but that's more than what this is. He's just as much white as he is black. That's not my opinion. That's a fact. So for him to be speaking as loud as if he's like, dude, you from a hundred feet down, people got to get a little closer to you to figure out what the hell you are. I don't act like you just going to a reccease, or you wanted braids, all of a sudden you, you like living this sort of experience by way of black people. Now look, I would say this from my, even my own family like, yeah, people's parents because they thought at the time, definitely because he's a little, a little older than me. So it would have been around the time, certainly when I was coming up. Yeah, certain parents wouldn't want you to have braids or have, have cornrows or rather other, other sorts of hairstyles because well, yeah, to your point, it looked unprofessional or what have you. I'm not going to sit up here and like act as if let's say that was some sort of perpetuated racism just simply because well that because you know white people have goofy haircuts that has gone in and out of style. Or maybe unprofessional, you brought up like mullet and what have you that, you know, if your son probably was like, hey, I want to get that on some like ridiculous looking, maybe Mohawk or something, you probably like, yeah, that's not happening. That looks trashy, right? Yeah, someone might say that looks like white trash. Yes, exactly. That's too redneck, right? Exactly, bingo. So it's not like it's out of pocket to say that. My issue here is the revisionist history about it all because he is trying, look, I guess this is his new like cash cow here. We know what he's done with like, I think what is it? Nike, who he does a lot of stuff with and we know what he's doing now. I wonder who the hell is buying the books because I don't think anybody's voluntarily buying them. I'm willing to bet there's some state funding that's absolutely in there, probably libraries and stuff that are buying those because I don't see anybody lining up to sit up here and basically it's a self-insert graphic novel of him telling the story of some supposed racism that he experienced. Now, all of a sudden he's what, 30 something years old now, over 30 years, because I'm 32, he's older than me. So he's well over 30 years old and now all of a sudden there was some perpetuated racism that you just somehow stumbled across that your family did to you that brought you in because they wouldn't do a racism very well to bring in you and to raise you and up until now we hadn't heard any bad things about him. It was crazy. 35 years old. 35 years old. Well, sometimes it takes you a while to remember. It got so bad in his house he actually, he blacked it out so that he wouldn't have to remember the traumatic experience of being raised by these evil white people who took care of him. Well, this is where this is what's really concerning about this is also if you look at the way she described the book, it's like that he's some introvert. So now the whole idea of this book is that you're some sort of like shy victim, right? That's the whole idea of the book. So they had to create this villain because they want this person to be victimized, this character of Colin Kaepernick, this revisionist history. And so they don't have that many villains because the guy ended up going to the NFL, you know, he was an incredible high school athlete. I think he was like one of the best baseball players in the country. Could have gone to the major leagues in baseball, supposedly he was such a good athlete. Could have played in both and he chose football. Those are his words. I think I believe he said it in that interview as well. But long story short, he has you created villain. And if the worst thing his parents ever did was say this haircut is unprofessional after all the good that they did, raising you, paying for all your vacations, going to every single game, paying for your cleats, teaching you, giving you the guidance that you needed to be disciplined enough. And it clearly worked. You came up and you were successful. It all worked. And it all worked. And then you go to make a cartoon book and throw them under the bus. It's just the lowest form of moral character that you could possibly have. It really is. It really is. I mean, as a parent, I'm like, I sacrifice so much for my children that I just cannot even imagine. Birth, birth, children are not. I cannot even imagine doing all of that, sacrificing my, I mean, what did they adopt him when he was five weeks old? So I mean, this is 18 plus years of supporting this guy. Obviously, they supported him through college. You were dedicating decades of your life to taking care of a child who was going to turn around and tell everyone in the media how you oppressed them. I mean, because it's not even like he's saying it to his friends. He is blasting you in public at the highest levels of media. And they didn't even do anything really racist. Like imagine if they actually did something racist. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think they're going to call him Kaepernick. I guess they did. Okay. But I do want to ask you, Eric, before we move on. So at that time, was it true that gang members or whatever frequently had their hair in corn rock? Yeah. Like it was a stigma behind it. Let's not be like, beat around a bush about that. I don't think it came from out. Obviously. But I think that certainly was a stigma. And you can see that I was portrayed in entertainment. And it's not like other black parents weren't privy to it. They were certain as some people that didn't have the hair in cornrows. But I've read some reaction from black people who have said my parents didn't want me to get cornrows either. Yeah. And they're black. That's what I'm saying. They thought it would make me look like a thug too. To the point that you had made, I think every kind of culture has that thing that they do whether it be in style, like in clothing, or whether it be in like hair, whether they're like that depicts you in a way that they see as unfavorable and they wouldn't want you to have it. It's not like they're doing it out of just racism. Otherwise, I guess all these black parents were racist. Yeah. That's I guess. I guess. Well, they're probably white supremacists too. Yeah. To be fair. Yeah. They're turned a lot. So I want to move to this new budget plan that Joe Biden released yesterday that, well, I'll say like pretty light on dealing with the drug crisis that is obviously, I mean, I mean crisis that is sweeping the country, but definitely really heavy on gender politics. It mentions equity 63 times. That's double the times, by the way, it mentions the border transgender. The word transgender is featured eight times. The word queer is featured seven times. I thought we weren't. I'm very confused on the word queer. The queer is okay now. We're allowed to say that now. You know how I know it is because I bought a shirt for NYC Pride when I was there because I didn't have any pride and queer was on like every shirt at Target. So that's how I know that. Really? Yeah. There a lot of it is queer. So that's okay. Okay. But Target can sell it. That's the beacon of what it is. And it's not like, and it's not like, it's not like the end. No, that used to be with an N word. It's like, well, the inwards bad no matter what, but in the 90s queer was like. No, no, but I'm saying, but I'm saying black people are allowed to say it and no one else is. It's not there anywhere. No, no. The only one that's allowed to say it or no? Because you used to play the football game smear the queer with the football, whoever the football you tackle. That's when it was bad. Now, now that game, they love it. The teachers make you play smear the queer and the teachers are queer. Okay. So, so queer is mentioned seven times in this budget proposal. Opiois, by the way, only four. So it's good to know that they have their priorities in front of them. Equity is obviously a key focus in the context of racial equity. His plan, they say, would cut the deficit by 2.9 trillion over the next decade. It is, again, they say, oh, it never ends up being quite that way. And it's going to raise, they say, 4.7 trillion from higher taxes, of course, to evil billionaires and all of these wealthy corporations who don't deserve all that money that they worked for. And the tax increases include a reversal of the 2017 tax cuts made by Donald Trump on people earning more than 400,000 a year. He also floated a new 25% minimum tax on households worth 100 million or more. The top marginal tax rate would be increased from a two, 39.6% from the current, 37%. And by the way, congratulations to the labor department who would see an 11% raise, the education department who would see a 13.6% raise, environmental protection agency. Oh, man, they're doing a lot of good things, especially we see in wake of the Norfolk Southern train crash, they would see a 19% raise. So good on them. Defense department would only see 3.2% veterans affairs, 2.2%. Eric's head is already about to explode. No, it pisses me off mainly because obviously, yes, this stuff impacts me. I've been into a brand new tax bracket as of this last couple of years. So all this stuff impacts me. And I look at even as me, my county folks, while we're trying to make dollars make sense. And I look at the amount of money that the state or rather in the federal government is wanting for me and the amount of money that I could spend on employing other people, creating other things that are going to again, give more people opportunities. And they'd much rather tax me and give themselves a rate. I've literally made that exact point here on this show a billion times about them giving themselves raises as they cripple everybody else because it's okay for them and their cronies, they're the criminal organization here. Them and their cronies can do whatever it is that they need to do as long as they can keep reaching in the pockets of Americans. And they say wealthy, they're like, I don't know, a lot of people make over $400,000 by the way. That aren't, let's say, just rolling in dough like that. Well, because I believe that it's, well, I believe that it's, that's the family rate. It was too, if my memory serves me correctly, it was 250 individual, 400,000 family. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. It's like, it's, it's, it's, they- So who cares if you're working hard and you're making that amount of money, who cares? Exactly. Right. Why, why is it that we need to give you more money when you've already indicated that you have no, no desire to spend it, first of all, in a way that benefits other Americans, but spend it in a way that's efficient. You deficit spend, as you speak, probably documented in the, in the budget proposal, they're already accounted for the deficit spending that they're going to do. They're going to get all this other money and then they're going to still spend money that they already don't have, which again, considering that in the printing of all this money, you are crippling people's, no matter what economic class that they're in, you're hurting them. And meanwhile, as their money devalues, right, and those people that are at salaries continue to stay at the salary that they are going to be at, you are giving yourselves raise. This is a heist. Let's call it exactly what it is. And these guys are the criminal organization, which is why I wasn't bending over my, you know, bending over, falling over hell. The people trying to defend what happened on January 6th, because I'm not going to pretend like they ate the criminal class. Yeah, but I mean, look, it's been, it's worked out so well for us to have them in schools, right, in education system. And they are going to give 1.1 trillion in new spending towards childcare, early learning, higher education, other social. So that's good, because it's been working out really well for us to have them involved in, you know, higher education and early learning. One, you're stating some of the numbers and you saw there's some big increases, but I think it was like the military only got a 3% increase. Yeah. Because the military is already like taking so much of our budget. In America, we don't produce anything. You know, this country literally, all we make are bombs. We literally don't produce anything. So our debt is only going to get bigger and bigger and bigger rolling on a bar. So I think it's all kind of fake and lame and it's meant to just, I guess, give them some sort of political win that they're, you know, I guess, decreasing the debt, but that's all a lie. It's only going to get bigger. Yeah, I mean, it's fake and lame, but the impact that it has on every day, citizen, is real. What I'm saying is we're trying to look at these numbers as if they're going to actually fix something and they're trying to give us these wins. That's all fake. You know, the debt's only going to get more. There's no, they're going to sign some piece of paper and now all of a sudden our debt problems are going to go away. So it's just... The bloated bureaucracies that we've already put trillions of dollars into that are very, very inadequate. Don't worry, if you just throw more money at it. Exactly. It was just stimulus bill. Yes. Right. So, you know, and I think it's meant to fail. It's meant to not benefit the citizens. All right. So we've got more, but we need to take a quick break. I want to thank our sponsor Pure Health. So I don't know if you guys realize this, but the latest data from the American Heart Association indicates that adults with fatty liver were 3.5 times more likely to have heart failure than those without. Also 100 million Americans have fatty liver. So that's a lot of people at risk. Our livers are detoxifying our bodies from alcohol, toxins, Tylenol, cigarettes, if there are some of you who smoke.

Now, you guys may have heard recently Gavin Newsom was making the headlines for threatening. He's like, we're not doing any more business. The state of California is not doing any more business with Walgreens because they're not going to break the law in all of these states by offering these mail in abortion pills, which the states clearly have made illegal. Well, now New York Governor Kathy Hochl and AG over there in New York, Latisha James sent a letter pressuring pharmacies to keep selling abortion pills. They said, don't give it to pressure from Republican states to stop selling the abortion drug. Recent national events have spotlighted the critical role that pharmacies play in providing access to essential health care, including reproductive health care. That is why we write to you today and ask you to commit to making medication abortion available in your retail and mail order pharmacies across New York state. So you are literally talking about, by the way, to be clear, these states like New York, they're fine. They already have laws in place that like they, I mean, I'm sure you could get an abortion at somehow after birth in the state of New York and also California. They're asking these private companies to break the law in certain state, in other states because they, I don't know, I don't know. I don't know how it affects them other than saying, we're weird, championing women's rights. I want to pull up, I was just doing some research here on this abortion drug that they, the abortion pill that they refer to. And multiple peer reviewed studies show women are at risk of really severe side effects after taking these abortion pills, including hemorrhaging, the need for follow up surgery, and death. Chemical abortion has four times the complication rate of surgical abortion. And of course, I mean, that risk is only going to increase when you don't have a doctor who's right there who is actually managing your care, you're getting it from mail in from God knows where. And after a chemical abortion, there is a 53% greater risk for an ER visit for abortion complications than after a surgical abortion. Now, obviously I'm not advocating for any type of abortion, but how are you four women? How are you four women's health if you actually are advocating for these pharmacies to dispense drugs in states where these women are not seeing practitioners for this abortion? They're going to take the pill, they're going to have no idea what to do, and there's going to be an increased risk that they could die when they do this. Well, I think what this is, it speaks to the nature of like government and how terrible it certainly is. When it's getting involved, certainly in private affairs and has people wanting to take risk or they want them to take risk that they themselves aren't really the ones expected to take. The fact that they're even chiming in on this like, hey, we want you to do something in other states as it pertains to this abortion pill is insane. Well, and by the way, they're not just we want. We're threatening. Yes, a threat. That's exactly what it is because we're threatening the punishment, let's say, on their behalf. And that's the part that doesn't really make a whole lot of sense. Or rather, let's say that it's dangerous. It's a really dangerous line of thinking, but it isn't necessarily new. We see a lot of times where government and government officials will sit up here and like pimp these private institutions to do their own bidding, but it's not like for the betterment of the individuals or the betterment of the people. It's more this is what our particular ideology is, or this is what we believe this is the flavor of the month. And because you don't do this, we take issue. And this is why I always talk about the discipline with leftists. And it goes all the way up to their politicians, man. When you don't do something that they just the importance of their parallel economy, right? Because when you don't do something that they let's say disagree with, let's say you do something they vehemently disagree with. They will do everything they can to punish you everything in their power, which is why I want to limit that power. And the folks team on the other side, we look for a lot more concessions to make with whether it be with companies as well as governments when they do act, let's say, an error or act in a way that's ideologically opposed to what it is that we believe in. But again, it just, I mean, I hate to bring up this whole like, you know, separation of these different states and I think that should be nation states as of right now, like why on earth is that a conversation that we're even having where you're like, hey, you're way over there in California and you're trying to threaten private companies as far as what they should be doing in other areas that you don't even, you shouldn't be ruling over anywhere. You're on area, let alone some other people's area. That's pretty crazy to me. Man. Yeah, I mean, abortion is a tough one because it's become so, you know, political, it's politicized, right? You know, they try to say like it's not murder. And obviously if you give a person an abortion pill, it's obviously killing a baby. And the fact that these people fight for it the most, it's like, I don't know. I don't know why they don't come to Jesus basically or some sort of like come to Jesus meeting realize that they're actually responsible for killing so many babies by giving people access to this medication. So what they're doing is evil and it's just that simple. Like even when you see these doctors and that's why when you said that stat that you're actually more likely to get injured from a chemical abortion than a physical abortion, that's kind of a bloom I mind the most. So, yeah, I mean, these people don't care about the safety of the baby and we just live in this world. Of course they don't care about the safety of the baby. So they don't care about the safety of you either. I think all of a sudden they care about you just as little as they care about that baby. Yeah. All right. I want to go to really quickly here. I found this funny Ukrainian president. Volana Mersal And I do to concerns that Hollywood was only showering Ukraine with attention because those affected by the conflict are white while ignoring wars around the globe that impact people of color. I actually appreciate that because I said that in just the other day. That's true. I was talking to I was on I was on with Chad Prather and I was like, you could argue that these people are racist because there are all sorts of conflicts going on all across the globe all across, you know, Africa and all of these places where the people are not white and we aren't getting involved there. So I think they're just doing it because they're white and they're racist. They must be white supremacist, Eric. That's the hilarious part is that the only time they will end up taking, let's say, the opposite position is when it has to mix them up, let's say racist or there's some sort of diversity or lack thereof or disparity or something that that's the only time they can see something is wrong. You can't just say, all right, this is factually what what it is. This is why this is wrong. You don't even have to play on the whole racial card. They don't get it then. But God forbid you accuse them of racism. Oh, wait a minute. Now we've seen the error of our ways and we may need to switch up. This is just absolutely hilarious to me. No, I mean, I think they basically pointed to the elephant in the room. That's a big factor of why people care about this war is because it's white on white violence in Eastern Europe. Seriously, we didn't care about all the young children that we bought with drone strikes in the Middle East. I mean, seriously, if these people in this region, the Donbas region of Ukraine were a different color, people would probably care less about it. And if you think that's just me saying that, then why does the Academy Award not have Zalinski? They all want Zalinski. They all want the Zalinski bump, but they don't want to do it because they do not want to seem like they're sympathetic to white people. Well, I also think it really comes down to what the United States can what's in it for them. Right. I mean, they've used Ukraine for a very long time as I'm laundering. Well, I don't know. No, actually, I think they actually do believe that it's probably racist because why wouldn't they want the bump of Zalinski? Because then everybody talks about it or they because these Hollywood people are smart or they like the marketing aspects of being able to decline him. And then now we're on the news and why I talking about it. And then they're talking about an access Hollywood. Then they're talking about an inside edition. So either way it's a win-win. That okay, that is true because I didn't even know that the Oscars were. I don't even know. No, Sunday. I don't know when they are. Exactly. Are they Sunday? Potentially. Really? Yes, I was thinking. Wait, were you nominated? No, I'm not nominated. I'm not actually invited at all. I was going to come an uninvited guest to see Jimmy Kimmel, but that's just the tearsade. It's neither one or there. That's going to be. What do you mean, hearsay? You just said it. Well, I'd say I'm saying it, but you're hearing it. So it's hearsay. It's not how you're saying. No, I'm a lawyer. Well, I learned that in law school. So just go with it. Did you go to law school? No. Exactly. So just it's hearsay. Next question. You know what? This is illegal. This is illegal for a city. Is that a real apple law school? Yeah, they do, and it's not accredited. So if you would. All right, we got to take a break. We'll be back. Independent journalist Matt Taiby and Michael Shellingberger appeared before Congress yesterday for a hearing with the select subcommittee on the weaponization of the federal government. Now as expected, the Democrats on the panel repeatedly attempted to bully both Taiby and Shellingberger into giving up their Twitter file sources. I want to play for you. This is Stacy Plaskett, who began the attack. I mean, she was in her opening statement already out on offense, referring to them as so-called journalists. I want to play for you Stacy Plaskett really trying to get them to reveal their sources. Watch. To these emails. Who was the individual that gave you permission to access the emails? Well, the attribution from my story is sources at Twitter, and that's what I'm going to refer to. Okay. Did Mr. Musk contact you, Mr. Taiby? Again, the attribution from my story is sources at Twitter. Mr. Shellingberger, did Mr. Musk contact you? Well, I really know I was brought in by my friend Barry Weiss, and so this story has been a lot of misinformations for disinformation about Mr. Taiby, Ms. Weiss. Thank you. Mr. Taiby, have you had conversations with you on Musk? I have. Okay. Mr. Taiby, did Mr. Musk place any conditions on the use of the email? Is that a little bit of a gentle light of yield per second? As long as my time is not using it. Are you trying to get journals? No, I'm not trying to get to know. I'm not. I am asking. No. I'm not sure. I sounded like you're trying to get journalists to reveal their sources, which is really fascinating for me to watch. I mean, you know, we talked in the last segment about how government constantly tries to abuse their power and tries to intimidate, you know, the private citizen, the independent journalist, whoever that may be. But number one, these people seem very ill-equipped as I'm going to play for you guys here in a bit after I get your thoughts. These people in Congress seem very ill-equipped to handle any of these things. She didn't even know that Barry Weiss was a female. She said, Mr. Weiss, it was like, did you even, did you do any amount of research before you came to this meeting? No. You just wanted to bash these people and you wanted to find out their sources. Why? Why? Why do you care who the source is? What does it matter to you? We have the documents. It clearly shows the government working in conjunction with these big tech companies to censor Americans. I guess, of course, you'd want to change the narrative to who was your source. Who freaking cares? You still did it. So let's talk about that. Yeah, that's not the point. It's not like the whole entire ordeal. You had a, if you actually watch it a bit, but it's not like for the most part they're trying to dispute what was actually uncovered for the most part. It's not really the dispute there. It's more of, well, you're out of pocket for doing it. And we want to try to at least strike some sort of fear that you should. And we shouldn't be doing it because, well, it's their allies that are being made to be looked bad with this whole situation. But that's the hilarious thing. I wish they would certainly go after these other mainstream journalists and their anonymous sources as they regurgitate, whatever the hell it is that they often left us, want them to say you don't see them coming before Congress being asked, like, who the hell told you, had you break that story? Certainly when it goes against their political enemies. That's all this is about. And I think everybody for the most part knows it's who this condemns. It has nothing to do with the fact that they are, they think there's some security thread or anything of that nature that simply has to do with the fact that they're, they're allies, the people that end themselves, obviously, as these, these definitely these Democrats in office look bad because they're working in conjunction with these billion dollar tech, tech industries to punish their ideological enemies on various platforms. That's what it uncovered. Now, you can be mad all you want that, well, we know that it, I mean, we kind of already assumed that it was a thing. All the Twitter files was confirming. So it matters, it matters us all. You want to be mad at time. Be mad at everybody there uncovering it, but it doesn't change the facts of the matter. It's fascinating too because, you know, you see the government talking about, I mean, she's asking, well, were there any deals made? It's like, and who cares if there was? If there's a private company that wants to pay someone, if someone wants to pay that private company for information, like, yes, and who cares if there was a deal made? Well, they have to uncover because, I mean, everything got exposed. We knew that the 100 by laptop is real the whole time and that we know that they were working in conjunction with the Department of Justice to censor that information. So now these politicians are like, oh, well, we got to do something to make these tech companies seem like they still, you know, we're actually not protecting the deep state. So it's just obvious now all this is coming to light in these politicians when they go there, not even know who Barry Weiss is, not knowing who Matt Tyaby is. It's hard to say his last name. But like, if she doesn't even know about the Twitter leaks or the Twitter files, she's not dialed in. She has no idea what's going on, in my opinion, with a Twitter censorship. Yeah, I mean, how much do you really know if you don't know who Barry Weiss is? Yeah, and this particular subject, she's in that committee meeting talking about this. You don't use Twitter, obviously, if you don't know Barry Weiss's and you don't know any of these. Michael Shellenberg are all these people. They're all pretty well known now if you've even just been on the platform for like five minutes. Well, so it's not even these journalists. It's also like actual platforms themselves. I want to play who is a Sylvia Garcia, a congresswoman, Sylvia Garcia, sadly from Texas, but she is a Democrat, so I understand. She doesn't even know what a sub stack is. She doesn't know what she's like, I don't, there's something on the internet. It's called a sub stack. I'm not sure what that is, watch. Yet you yourself posted on your, your, I guess it's kind of like a web page and I'm trying to understand what sub stack is, but that what I can say is that, what is she a billion years old? I guess it's sort of like a HTTP web page. I'm not, I'm not sure what this is. Like, lady, okay, I'm in favor for age limits, congress, presidency, everywhere. This is a great example of why we need that. Well, they're all stupid either way, even the young ones. I mean, look at no further than any of these. The young ones are maybe dumb. They don't even know what sub stack was. Yeah, I mean, yeah, but to your point, yeah, a lot of them, I mean, you see, I don't know if you got saw Bernie Sanders on what's his name show the other day? Bill Maher, Bill Maher, him as a big producer quality. He had no idea. He was completely out of his way on that. And most of them are, most of them, they get marching orders. I'm going to tell people this all the time. Like, you guys read these bills, right? And it'll be like co-sponsor this. But you think they read that damn thing? That thing's like five million pages long. You think they wrote it? Like read it and let it on, wrote it. You think they didn't know these guys have a lot of them have absolutely no idea what it is that they are talking about. And this is why it's so dangerous that we put so much power in these individuals when it comes to dictating what millions upon millions of people are supposed to do, especially in the economy. I mean, these Kenzie and that economists that work for these guys are completely out of what they're with. They don't know what they're talking about. Everybody's guessing, but we're expected to hang on to them as far as what we're supposed to do in the future or how we're supposed to spend money or how we're supposed to act. And when you ask these guys basic questions pertaining to stuff that they should have had long enough time to research, they don't even know what the hell's going on. Yeah, I want to play what we're like. Yeah, play the next clip. This is the best part. The idea Garcia completely lost once again once. I'll, again, I'll move on and I wanted to ask Mr. Schillenberger, the same question, sir, when did you first visit with or get contacted by Mr. Musk? I'm not going to reveal my sources, but like I said, I was invited by Barry Weiss. Am I asking for sources, sir? I'm just asking for chronology. I was. Did you first make contact with Mr. Musk? I don't know the exact date. Was it? It was December. It was December. December of, well, there's a lot of December's in here. December of last year. Which December? December of last year. In 1999. By the year of the 2022. Yes. All right. Now in your discussion, in your answer, you also said that you were invited by a friend, Barry Weiss. My friend Barry Weiss. So this friend works for Twitter or what is her? She was a journalist. Sir, I didn't ask you a question. I'm now asking Mr. Schillenberger a question. I'm sorry, sir. She's a journalist. She's a journalist. So you work in concert with her? Yeah. Do you know when she first was contacted by Mr. Musk? I don't know. You don't know. So you're in this as a threesome? There was many more people involved in that. Oh! Where people involved with it. No! We need to be here today either through consulting fees, campaign contributions. Absolutely not. I can't listen. I can't listen. I can't listen. I can't listen. I can't listen. I'm like, this is like Congress, that's exactly what's going on through the head. Like, holy crap. They probably all turn in the hand office right there. Like, we see this is what we want in the country right now. Journalism orgies. Yeah. Seriously, I mean, you know, just the ineptitude of her questioning. She had no idea what she was talking about. She didn't know what she asked. You didn't even know what the room was about. These balls, she's like, what is this? There's a big text in the chat. I mean, give me a break. So you're saying you worked in concert. With, like, Elon Musk. Elon Musk. I mean, I guess they gave me the information. I don't really know what you want me to say. Wait, did you just accuse me of having a police? All right, let's go ahead and take a quick break. We'll be back with more. I love that they can. Hi. I love that they can. Hi. Blaze TV subscribers just want to give you guys a thank you and a shout out for being subscribers.

All right. You can continue freeloading, but at least click those buttons. We want to, I want to present to you the first edition of Dear Sarah. We told you guys that we would be doing it. If you needed advice, you needed dating tips, whatever you need, you can email us at dearsera at theblaze.com and we would be taking some of your questions. We have gotten quite an influx. So we will be doing these over the coming weeks. Keep sending in your questions. We will get to them. But here's the first one. It says, Dear Sarah, I have a good friend and I was telling her about what's going on in the schools. How all the teachers tell kids to lie to their parents. So my friend said, where are you hearing all of these lies? She's in her 40s and I've known her for over 20 years. I tried telling her, but finally I just quit talking to her about it. She said, whatever, these kids are comfortable in their skin. So it is okay. I was ready to shake her, but she is a really big girl and too big for me to shake. This is hurting my friendship with her. Any suggestions? I assume you mean the belief system and not the fact that she's too big to shake is hurting your friendship with her. But look, here's what I would say. Friendships have to be based. Friendships are typically based. The friendships that work are based in common beliefs, common value systems, right? Common morals. Kind of why friendships work. And so if protecting kids is a big deal to you and it's not a big deal to her and she wants to claim that it's lying, I prefer to surround myself with people who have common value systems, common beliefs, common interests, common interests in protecting children and making sure that all of the sexualization and the indoctrination stops in public schools. And I would just ask you to kind of revisit how important this friendship really is to you. And we're going to talk about it from the friendship, right? It doesn't sound like a lot. I want to share a story really quickly here. I had a mom friend. We'll call her a mom friend. And our kids grew up together since they were very, very little. COVID hit. She was she she was conservative ish, I guess, COVID hit. She got crazy about the masks. We didn't see each other for a very long time over a year. Finally when she started leaving her house again with her children, she said, well, we're happy to do play dates, but only if you and your child wear a mask. And I said, we're not going to do that. We're not wearing masks inside. We're definitely not wearing masks outside. We're going to be outside. It's going to be, you know, we're breathing fresh air. We're not going to do that. And she couldn't she got very mad that she couldn't control us into wearing masks. And that was the last time we spoke was when I said, I'm sorry, we can't do that. And we've never spoken again because it just, you know, something happens. And if something is that important to you, the relationship just isn't going to work. That's my that's my personal opinion. Do you guys have any different opinions on that? Well, just real quick, because it has been a friend for 20 years, this isn't just like a small acquaintance or shorter acquaintance. I think the shaking is a good analogy. I always talk about this all the time. It's like, you can't like shake somebody. You can't wake them up to all the bad stuff that's going on in the world. So almost just like them for them and don't even like wake them up to the black peeled reality. It's unfair, but ignorance is bliss and be friends with them for being friendly and not because, you know, but sometimes I think people are friends for so long. They grow apart. Yeah, if it was 20 years ago, she may have been a different person than you may have been a different person then. But it's okay to grow apart. You don't have to stay friends with everyone just for the sake of staying friends. Well, yeah, exactly. But it's also like you're trying to shake and wake people up. I know that she was just saying that as a metaphor, it's not really necessarily your job to wake people up. I think people kind of wake up on their own. I know that sounds crazy because I talk about conspiracies and stuff. If you're not really interested in realizing that about the vaccine, about the pandemic, you can't teach somebody that by yelling at them. They have to want to learn it themselves. Yeah, Eric, you can. Well, I mean, yeah, me and my friends, the ones that I actually would call my friends were pretty much out of the aisle and a lot of like core topics. And look, man, certain people have certain issues that are important to them. And if it's a divisive topic, it is. But if it's to the point to where you can't like get over it, you can't really shake that because it's that important to you. Look, man, ain't nothing wrong with like, hey, man, toning it down a little bit, taking a step back as far as maybe that friends no longer your friend, and maybe it's an acquaintance. Because it's an important topic to you. You shouldn't feel like you have. I mean, it's your friend after all. You shouldn't feel like you have to sacrifice something that's so important to you for the sake of either coddling the feelings or maintaining some relationship with another individual. Yeah. So, you've got to get too quickly. Hey, Sarah, I love your work. I'm here to ask you if it's true that if you don't use it, you lose it asking for a friend. Well, 40 year old virgin. I actually am married with children, so I wouldn't know anything about that. Alex? That's true. That's what they say. You know, what is it, the law? An object that is in emotional stand motion. What I'm saying is Alex doesn't use it. So he must have- I've already lost. And you say, you better use it or you will lose it. That's a fact. We've got to cut a break. We'll be back. 80 year old transgender woman has revealed how she's finally living as the woman she's always been. Look at this lovely lady Isabelle Jeffrey. She went gender confirmation surgery in January and says he knew from a young age that he had been born in the wrong body. He also- oh my gosh, look at that beauty. He also, by the way, was previously kind of a manly man, a sailor, a firefighter and a truck driver in his younger life. He met his wife at the age of 16 and they married five years later, had two kids together. And when he was in his 70s, he received his wife's blessing to start living as a woman. But his wife has Alzheimer's disease and is not fully aware of his transition. She's like, who are you lovely lady? Would you like to go watch the golden girls with me? I'm your, I don't know, does he say husband or wife? Wife. And I don't know, you've had a penis for 79 years and then you cut it off. This way, how did the doctor even say that like he was healthy and fit and enough for that surgery? I could have got a molar of Venezuela where I got a for my gender-based type of surgeries. They'll just plop it off. Eric, help me. We have 10 seconds help me. It's really hard to find. That's wild, but no, I don't understand. Like he's a very old person at that point. She's like, no, I mean, you want to keep- Maybe it's all about the money. Yeah. Stream and subscribe to more Blaze Media content at theblaze.com slash podcasts."
