I'm in solo today. It is a friday So let's kick those lines wide open 800 282 2 8 8 2 we've got a lot to dive into together even white house officials starting to leak to some outlets That they're kind of worried about the fact that joe biden can only have meetings during a few hours a day And uh joe rogan weighed in on the biden situation. You're gonna want to hear That sound bite uh from haman just a little bit Randy wine garden the uh chief commissar of the uh teacher's unions lying so much uh on The issue of school closures yesterday and and just do the whole thing Is meant to rewrite history these people who were so thuggish and and vicious and nasty Democrats in their shutdowns continued shutdowns of schools You know, I know they try to muddy the waters by saying well look at all these people who shut down it shutting down in March of 2020 is not the same thing as shutting down in Uh, september of that year And then january of the following year and then the following september we will discuss some of this In just a little bit also, you know, we had that to rfk sit down or I should say Um interview wasn't really good. They weren't sitting down with each other, but we had the rf a rfk uh interview yesterday with clay he went on abc news And guess what? Uh, they're still doing the we cannot allow these false claims to be aired on on our station. So um, we will discuss that i've got i've got a bit of breaking news and then some Likely to be breaking news that I can speak to you about later today Let's start with what has happened that you need to know about or what is in progress right now Remember when there was that moment of the banks looking real shaky and silicon valley bank was In need of a federal intervention they can call it whatever they want it. It's a bailout of some kind Right. Otherwise the bank was just going to go under and depositors were going to be left Well without their deposits remember when that happened and then first republic bank Had a really shaky moment. Uh the biden ministration Of course a shortest right away. They said don't worry about it. Everything's going to be just fine. We've got this covered You know, we're we've got the the smartest People in the whole financial and economic world working for joe biden, you know Like janet yellen and pete buddha judge and look at the cabinet that he's picked But okay put that aside for a second put put that aside Um The first republic bank right now has seen its shares drop 50 And is likely according to cnbc to go into fdic receivership So so let's just do a quick review here. There was a series of bank failures They said that don't worry. We have We have stopped the bleeding here financially. We have we have stopped the Freefall of these banks and then the cascading effect the domino effect what can happen next People get really freaked out about this right because it affects the money that you put in the bank. This is a big deal understandably Biden said don't worry about it. Don't worry about it bub. Jack buddy. We got it covered Right, that's what biden was telling. You know, we're gonna gonna make the banks stable When he does the creepy whisper, you know, you're in a much better place Uh and turns out the banks are non stable or at least first republic bank is not stable I don't know. I can't look at the balance sheets of all these banks I don't know what they did and how on the wrong side of the interest rate rise they've gotten But you know, we all sit around and say hey what could trigger a Descent into a clear and rough recession It's something like this It's a bank that is on the edge of failure or Perhaps additional banks that will now be shown to be shaky and on the edge of failure that my friends Is how you can find yourself in the midst of a recession so bad that biden and kareen jon piair and the whole White house apparatus will have to say to you. Oh, yeah, we messed this thing up This isn't a bad well. They won't admit that they did it, but they'll say this is not good The economy is in a uh in a bad place. So i'm not sure that's going to happen It might take a little while longer. I hope it doesn't happen because A recession means job losses. It means uh economic Anxiety and and even destruction for people it can mean the end of businesses and people's dreams being shattered recession is an ugly thing But it increasingly looks like it is inevitable Based on the policies and based on the decision making that we have seen from the uh people who are in charge in this white house and what they've been doing and how they have been operating um up to this point so um And Now i want i want to i want to transition for a second here. I want to transition and talk to you about What is going on in nashville with regard to the manifesto, right? So the nashville um Trans shooter manifesto. We are told Is likely to be released there the police are saying it will be released at some point the police are saying that there will be a Um There'll be a manifesto that you'll be able to see Now, I don't know what's in it But I want to get a little bit ahead of this because Here's my first of all. It's this story has been the last 24 hours um This story has been the last 24 hours and we don't have a definitive timeline of it but what we do have Is the promise now from the nashville police that it will be released. Right. That's what we're being told. Okay Why has it been delayed this long? I want to get ahead of this because well, I don't know what's in it. I do know what the likely motivations are for holding this back and um I think it's most likely And what you'll see is they didn't want people to know um, they didn't want people to know that this individual was a radicalized member of the trans community and was by academic definition of what constitutes a terrorist a trans terrorist somebody who Felt that uh that she came from and aggrieved and besieged community That was suffering because of laws passed in tennessee for example that we're going to Prevent gender transition for minors. That's what I think is likely to be in there. I don't know But here's what i'm telling you if they release this thing In the next few hours, which they might maybe not even while i'm on the air here But if they release this on it, this would be the classic document dump on a friday Right trying to bury this story as much as they can now. Maybe they hold it to next week We don't know what the timeline is going to be but Understand that it is very likely in my mind that the reason for the delay was because the uh Impact the psychological impact and the calls for accountability Are very different will be very different based on the motive at this point in the national conversation Then they would have been and say A few days or even a week or so after the horrific Mass shooting it killed six innocent individuals including three tiny nine-year-old kids They withheld this information I would be willing to to bed. I mean, I'm quite sure this is the rationalization for it We'll see i'll tell if I if it turns out that i'm wrong and there was nothing in this Um, but think about it this way even if it's complete Uh, if it's if it's gibberish even if it is essentially completely and I'm sorry The fire alarm has gone off around me if you're wondering why i'm having it's okay though Everything's fine. There's no fire in the building. They're telling me So if I sounded like I got thrown off there for seconds because i'm once they're shouting over the pa system the fire alarm anyway um even if you were to find out that the uh the gibberish that could be in the nice gibberish I mean, it's it's just the rantings of a crazy person the the lunacy that could be uh underway That that was obviously underway, but the lunacy that you could be seeing that is completely Impossible To decipher in a meaningful way if that is the case if that is the case, um It's still I believe a choice that was made politically by the biden fbi and by the powers that be to Withhold this from the public so that people won't have The ability Uh didn't have the ability I should say to go through this and understand exactly what was going on and to focus on it less Right so just the manifesto existing would be a point of media focus just the manifesto being there Um out in the open for people would mean there's more conversation And the incident would get more attention and people would start to draw more parallels. They would say things like hold on a second There've been a couple of other mass shootings or attempted mass shootings involving Individuals who seem to have become radicalized members of the trans community What's happening here? Is it possible that the narrative that the democrat corporate media pushes on a regular basis that uh There the trans community is under constant You know mortal threat from all these all these horrible bigots everywhere that there is a genocide And that is a term that democrats will use a genocide of some kind underway against the trans community And you say how is that possible that they would say that because they believe the erasure of trans identity Is the destruction of an individual in such a way that It's Tantamount to a genocide think about that. I mean this is I understand we're going through some Some levels deep into the levels of crazy here Um, but this is this is why they've held it back up to this point. This is why they've decided Uh, they decided to go with it. So we'll see if they release it today. If I do i'll analyze it I'll read through as much as I can analyze it in real time um, I want to bring you into what the latest is on uh biden from his own staff also want to hear from all of you 800 282 282 And sorry there just so you know, it's you got to be a real radio pro and you have Three fire alarm announcements go off in your ear while you have Uh live radio show going so I hope I hope that I was able to push through that as as well as possible because I had And I hope you weren't able to really hear it But there were it's a very loud pa telling me that there was uh, no fire and I know there's no fire But you said it a few times so we'll get into all this 800 282 282 Um the most comfortable sheets you'll want to sleep on every night are the geeze a dream sheets and my pillow makes them Several years ago.

That's d es m o i d s dot com The second hour of clay and buck starts right now everybody. Let's talk about the us mexico border And the situation uh there of the worst border We have had in living memory. Some would argue the most porous the most open border That america has had certainly in its modern history Just take a moment to grasp The entirety of this by the numbers you're looking at about 6 million illegal entries at this point under bident now that is tough because the godaways are in the hundreds of thousands and But the the official number or the the most You know the the most precise number is about 5.5 million illegal entries to date And then hundreds of thousands of godaways and there are of course there's the Known godaways and unknown godaways is and we're not even not even aware that A godaway is somebody that that goes across the border. Let's say someone gets into a pickup truck and just you know The floors it and they never get apprehended by border patrol. That's a godaway Well, what about people that may be either tunnel Under the border or they come across in a very remote area or whatever the case may be you don't even know about those So let's call it about 6 million Illegal migrant entries into the country and you know just the language on this Becomes very difficult Meeting they keep saying that they're not 6 million illegals Now they broke the law to be sure coming into the country not at a port of entry through the lawful process is illegal But that law is effectively no longer enforced So it's been nullified illegal entry by the bident administration has been nullified And now we have processing and transportation and all of this done At massive taxpayer expense you have the mayor of New York city eric adam's Saying that the migrant crisis there is a disaster that is ruining the city those were his words Um, he's got 40,000 migrants. How is that 40,000 migrants? I thought they'd all be gonna do in the jobs americans won't do and You know, uh, they should have immigrants and it's just gonna make everybody wealthier and happier and and less crime and more More to go around right. I mean all the good things that are supposed to happen. You say hold on a second What's going on? Why is New York city having this? Moment where the mayor the democrat mayor and the entirely democrat system are demand now I know they want billions of dollars of federal funds because they are facing an eight billion dollar deficit in New York city next year ouch So part of this is a money grab I understand that but He could he could try to get money without saying that the migrants are a huge burden On the city that is hurting quality of life for the other residents, but that's what the mayor is saying So now just imagine what that is like that's only 40,000 migrants imagine all across the country you're looking at about six million Um, that's a pretty Massive wave, right? We all understand this Now I get to what the by-administrations doing about this mayorkus was just testifying about this recently Um, and we have we have some sound some some audio clips of him Talking about what's going on first of all he he calls this a a hemispheric challenge You notice this is the big thing they pretend like our ability to enforce our border Is really about a lot of multilateral meetings with countries all you know all the countries to our south And that's going to really deal with this play clip three Eric challenge that demands hemispheric solutions Working with our neighbors in the region we can and will reduce the number of migrants who reach our southern border The regional processing centers announced today will be a critical addition to the programs and processes DHS has in place for qualifying individuals to obtain authorization to enter the united states before arriving at our borders Now let me tell you what's happening here because they you know the democrat media is not going to tell you anything about this Okay, they're going to keep this quiet for right now You're seeing the shift as we go into this presidential election cycle They got a couple things one It is believe the biden administration is going to end title 42 Enforcement at the border remember that's a cdc pandemic Authority so oh pandemics happening. Sorry can't come in now There were still millions of people coming in but for single adult males it did give unless there were some you know other Specific car vaults and loopholes which were exploited too, but it gave An opportunity for single adult males who cross the legality to be quickly deported And it was used they say a couple of million times All right, so that's going to go away may 11th, which means there'll be a Surge of the human trafficking via the cartels and everything else. It's going to be a mess It's going to be a mess because that's an authority that allows for greater border enforcement, right? You take away that authority even though obviously the pandemic is over Things the border going to get worse So what is the biden administration doing? You know how i've been telling you to get ready for it And i can see the head shaking at me in a sense all across the countries you listen to this But you know it's true, right? I'm shaking my head telling you it That biden is going to run as a guy who is pro-police and actually republicans are the ones who want to defund the fbi And as crazy as that may sound you it doesn't matter that it's the point is it's a lie It doesn't matter that this is the the issue Um that the democrats are the most dishonest on they understand what they're doing They're lying to you on purpose And biden is going to be the face of that lie that the democrats who have ruined some of america's greatest and most beautiful cities With their idiotic crime policies are actually a party that respects law enforcement and you know wants to keep people safe and public safety and it's all lie Now that's one part of it Another part of this is and you can see this from the new announcement from mayorkas head of dhs Which controls border patrol which controls ice? That they are putting in place Some policies that are meant to start to turn the faucet off of illegal flow into the country Now that doesn't mean to shut it off entirely, but it means just to start the process So they're setting up these immigration processing centers for example in some other countries. I think the ones they've mentioned are guat guatamala and columbia Um now they're going to do this because they're going to say They're hoping that this will take some of the inflow Um, but guess what the people that the people that are coming in the country they know they're not actually asylum seekers But this is made to look like oh see we're giving people more options to apply for asylum in america now That's one way that could shake out meaning that just very few people go to the guatamala and columbia Migration processing centers to get them into america Remember asylum is Entry into the us. I need to be here or if I go back to my home country. I'll be oppressed and persecuted refugee is i'm in another country I want to come into america and i'm applying for it. That's kind of the way it breaks down within the system So it's similar that's just a little bit of a difference in the process So effectively they're setting up refugee processing centers in columbia and guatamala Um, so they can say see this is what we're doing they are also Also as title 42 gets ready to end here saying that they're going to start to enforce the law with regard to crossing through mexico And claiming asylum in america Hold on a second if you are columbian if you are guatamala if you're Thai if you're pakistani if you're Swedish whatever And you get all the way to mexico And then go all the way to america. You are not Asylum seeking you are shopping for a country you would rather be in it is a different thing You are not supposed to under our immigration laws you're supposed to apply for asylum in the first Safe country you go to and this also led to the third party safe agreements at the border that the trump set up We're okay. You want asylum in america you wait in mexico Until you get your day in court in america, right? Remember they set up that program second half of the trump administration what did biden do obliterated it? The whole point here is the incentive structure They're gaming the system in every way possible Just skip to the front of the immigration line to violate our laws to undermine our sovereignty and the democrats are grinning at them while they do it While looking at the at the voters in this country and saying, oh we want to secure border true. We we want to tighten things up now so That is I mean the way by the way the way NPR writes this the Biden administration is pushing ahead with a controversial rule That would make it more difficult for migrants to get asylum if they cross the border illegally after passing through mexico No That's the whole reason that it's not controversial. You see you notice that it's controversial. It's because Obviously they're not a silent asylum seekers are meant to be people who do not have the option Safely of remaining in their country because they are persecuted right So That's supposed to be if I go back there. I'm a you know, I'm a christian in a muslim country who faces, you know Death and and and my family faces the same unless I get out of here I'm a political dissident from the soviet union if you don't take me in your country i'm gonna be tortured and murdered my whole family That's what asylum is for it's not oh you guys have a great welfare state and better job opportunities. So sign me up That's immigration, which is great and fine But you're supposed to do that legally, right? We have a whole process for that a lot of people listening to this right now Went through that process. I'm surrounded here in uh, south florida by Millions of people who have gone through that legal process So then you get to the other part of this though, right? So on the on the you have the biden administration Setting up the rules changing or things around a bit so that they can make the claim to voters That they want a secure border too. So they've led in the six million And then going into the election the numbers they're going to start to trickle the numbers down They're going to start to bring You know, it's start to tighten up that faucet a little bit right still going to be flowing But they're going to tighten up a little bit. Why? So then the whole media goes oh look what by biden's working so hard to secure the border what it's all a head fake It's all a head fake. You know what they're going to do if biden wins another term Where can I place this bet the faucet the floodgates fly open again These little rules and things they're putting in place that are meant to just start to begin The you know to have the the wave of illegal immigrants recede That will be pushed aside and it'll be oh be a free for all over again. Sorry You know that the uh n gos They've decided that we're too harsh on these migrants or so we're just going to let everyone in again That's it. You know the sore is funded open borders groups, you know, they're really upset with us So uh, sorry those rules are all gone now They are doing this So that people forget What has happened at the border under the biden administration just long enough so they can vote the wrong way And then the border border can be kicked wide open This is the this is the game The obama ministration did this I remember this Remember they started to call obama the departure in chief And there were even some democrats who were saying that the obama ministration was Deporting um, you know Less than less than certainly it would have been deported under republican administration But they were deporting at a at a level that was pretty close to some historical norms and a drop down, but it wasn't Why were they doing that going into the 2012 election? Because what was the whole second term of the obama administration really focused on first term was Obama care as we know second term. What was the big thing they wanted amnesty? So by convincing people oh look at democrats. They're reasonable obama's the reporter and chief he wants a secure border too Oh, let's create amnesty for you know 15 million 20 million what no one knows what the number is Illegal is that we're in the country. That was the game that was being played there A similar game is being played here by the by administration. They want all of the well You're not going to forget, but they want enough americans to forget about what a catastrophe our border has been about how our border patrol Has been overstretched about how we've had such a The cartels are flush with cash. They want us to forget all of this And think oh, yeah, I guess biden's Starting to get serious about the border. Maybe maybe he is a moderate on this issue. Maybe we can trust him It's all a lie You see it and I see it and I I can see how they're moving the pieces around to the chessboard right now Straight out of the playbook Don't let them get away with it. We have to stay focused on this issue What's that phrase by the way hope for the best plan for the worst you've heard it before right? Look planning for the unexpected is the prudent thing to do the responsible thing to do And that means having emergency food on hand its food insurance Invest in a food foundation for your family with a three-month emergency food kit from my patriot supply These are meals prepared in such a way that the last for years and they're packaged They are available for you for years to come These kits provide over 2,000 calories every day for energy during tough times get breakfast lunch dinner drinks and snacks Order yours today receive a free gravity powered alexa pure pro water filtration system Value to $279 as a bonus with this offer your securing food and purified water for the next crisis Your three-month kit and free alexa pure pro are all shipped to your doorstep in discrete boxes with free shipping included Don't let this emergency food offer for my patriot supply pass go to my patriot supply calm. That's my Patriots supply calm The truth compass Pointing do right every day the clay travis and bucks exton show welcome back to clay travis and bucks exton show 800-282-8882 The same this flash up on the screen that Fox is running the story on how there is a surge in the demand for bulletproof cars because Crime has risen so dramatically in in many cities I just feel like This needs to be such a a major issue For everyone in the country forever in the country going in the 2024 election i'm gonna return to this in a second Um because it reminds me of friends of mine who actually grew up in latin america specifically in brazil who had to travel everywhere At their families in bulletproof cars because the crime rate was so high and the kidnapping was so common But we'll come back to that part in a second here. We got our friend ten newjint with us now He is a rock and roll legend. Um, he does so many things. I can't second amendment enthusiast He's a he's a great man. And he is talking to us today about a rally in austin texas that is scheduled for tomorrow Called how many more? Ted great to have you on the show sir. Tell us about what's going on with the how many more rally uh planned for tomorrow Well buck thanks for having me on. I appreciate happy spring turkey season two you all never ever refer to me as a second amendment Enthusiast refer to me as a second amendment absolutist, but anyhow, I'm i'm just a we the people guitar player And I am just heart broke and shattered and really pissed off that my government won't secure my borders I mean it's engineered recidivism. It's an engineered invasion And you don't give invaders a bus ticket. You don't process invaders You turn them the hell back So i'm going to try to wake up governor abbot to secure my home state of texas boy how radical and demanding can I be? Huh? So it's going to be a big rally where we've got legislation called the border force Where we're going to stop this engineered invasion this destruction of america this abandonment of the most Number one responsibility of our government that is to secure my damn country And there is a force to reckon with we're now civilians Yes, we the people civilians law enforcement heroes not to be confused with those guys And you've all day and and warriors of the us military not to be confused with mark milli Where we're going to secure the border. We're going to stand there and that we are going to make people Turn around and go back. You can't invade my country boy. Am I radical or what buck? Interesting. Um, yes these days to think that the us has a border and should enforce it is apparently If you're a democrat a highly radical position I know you guys at the how many more dot com is the is the site where people can see more of the details on this You want to empower the state of texas to create a state based border protection Unit, um, are you getting support from texas based law enforcement and i don't know maybe even the republican governor texas for this initiative Well, there's an incredible support. It's a demand from the streets I mean the citizens of texas are are just appalled the scratching the heads going what the hell is going on That are republican governor can't secure our borders. You know, i'm just a guitar player buck But i've got a couple hundred acres here on our spirit wild ranch and i've got my borders secure I've got buddies down in uh south texas who secured their borders, but they're not getting any help from the state or the No, the feds fed zilla has abandoned their number one responsibility So the other's incredible grounds. Well of support and it goes way beyond support. It's a demand We have got to secure our borders and stop this invasion. It's it's really uh Unprecedented abandonment of a cultural duty here and especially in the state of texas. Can you believe it happens in texas buck? Well, they got a big border right so it's a lot of a lot of ground that is being Left wide open for the cartel human smuggling as well as just the overall flow of migrants and drugs by the way fantherl i hadn't even talked about that I don't know if you heard me earlier in the hour uh ted but the situation the border is the worst It's ever been from a human trafficking perspective, but from a fentanyl trafficking perspective It is also the worst it's ever been and these things are tied together because of the resource depletion at the border Sometimes people members of border patrol will uh apprehend individuals crossing illegally And they'll have to spend an entire shift just processing them Which means they're not on the border which means then the cartels can run whatever drugs through they want And the you know the problem i think we face though ted is the biden administration Doesn't want to stop this and they're going to say it's a federal only issue right that States aren't allowed to do this kind of like what they've done with sanctuary cities So what do you think about about that? I mean is this partially to mobilize people to wake them up In advance of the 2024 elections to know that biden white house likes the situation as it is Well, how how embarrassing and and and and Unun unbelievable is the fact that you and i are talking Appushing the end of april 2023 and we're trying to create border security I mean we have a chemical warfare invasion from the communist chinese fentanyl gangs as facilitated and Driven home by the gangster mexican drug cartels in the mexican government And the mexican military in the mexican law enforcement. They're all gangsters and uncle sam has the doors wide open Literally facilitating and promoting the chemical warfare through fentanyl and meth amphetamine killing more americans annually than died in the vietnam war this this is just Toxic it is pure evil and and yeah, we're waking up I mean the apathy that has allowed this freak to get in the white house and allow these uh, these uh Laws and regulations to allow engineered recidivism engineered invasion Yeah, we're finally getting our head out of our ass. I've never had my head in my ass I've always been an activist always a self-evident truth guy, but now people are waking up and going yeah We got a bunch of chinese Nationals we got iranians iraqis simalian's Nigerians we got we got people coming in this country that are military Amen and they're invading our country and uncle sam is going out the red carpet. It must come to an end How many more dot com is the site? How many are you expecting? Ted tomorrow in austin texas at the how many more rally Well, we did a wonderful gun owners of america rally yesterday buck and we had a few hundred people show up It was uh, not well known that was going to happen because the media censures uncle tenn because truth logic and common sense is kryptonite to the media And uh, we expect to have thousands of people here today. I'm bringing my gibson bird land from calamazoo, michigan Uh to play a fire breathing star spangled banner kind of like the a 10 warthog soundtrack of freedom And uh, it's going to be a hell raiser.

Is that i'm going to do anything about this? Oh, yeah, there's this armies and armies of american families that are just a gas That this guy could be that Treasoness that both violate what he's doing. He's violating this. Oh, let me put it real clearly buck I think you know this I hate to preach to the choir, but it needs to be said I get to keep and bear arms There's no difference between a 17 and 7 8 inch rifle and an 8 10 inch rifle What the hell does that have to do with anything? And I have to get a federal permit from uncle sam to put a muckler on my gun I have to buy law.

Well black Shooting tragic shooting but thankfully not fatal occurred That that produced this massive outpouring of racial bath offs with Biden The ubiquitous benjamin crump race activists all saying that this is typical. This is how Blacks lose their lives. You can't even exist while black in the united states or knock on the door Well, well black in the united states without Getting your head shot at Uh, and every the media went completely along with this narrative. It's a very familiar narrative. They just basically have to go into default mode We are living a complete lie buck It is not the case in kansas city Blacks are 26 a little over 26 of the population They commit 72 of all homicides Blacks are nine times More likely to commit homicide than whites Uh, it is whites if you if you're involved in interracial violence in kansas city The the pattern is going to be black on white and that is true nationally as well buck If you look at all interracial violence between blacks and whites and whites Non-lethal interracial violence because this is self-reported so you can't report after you've been killed But when you when you pull hundreds of thousands of americans as the bureau of justice statistics does about What their experiences were with violent crime in the previous year You learn that 87 percent Of all interracial violence between blacks and whites Is committed by blacks on whites So I give a whole list of things that are hazardous If you're white, you know driving a car well white cycling well white trying to stop shoplifting well white Uh riding the subway well white riding a city bus well well white All of these things walking in downtown minneapolis well white All of these activities have resulted in some of the most brutal sickening attacks That are black on white But of course the media rule buck is Here's what it is The only time race will pass the lips Of the mainstream media and even the conservative outlooks in a crime situation Is if the victim is black and crucial additional criterion The assailant is white So every other possible combination white on white black on black black on white The race will be assiduously kept off stage and so the public is left with this phony impression That the only type of interracial crime out there is white on black Heather, you know that same weekend When there was the shooting Which was non fatal and he has no lasting You know wound or disability from it that that is uh, it is severe for yet ralph yarl there was a woman Uh, who was shot in upstate new york fatally For pulling into the driveway of of the wrong house essentially and so calen gillis Lost her life in very similar circumstances But the biden white house didn't reach out to calen gillis's family to add you know to try to comfort them after Their 20-year-old daughter who was white was killed under very Similar relatively similar circumstances to what we've heard about the Yarl case why is that why would it be biden white house invite ralph yarl to the white house as soon as he recovered Um, but the fatal shooting in upstate new york gets Own very little media attention and certainly no white house attention Because it doesn't fit the narrative, you know, I am sick of racial etiquette at this point But I understand it's necessity, but i'm going to be very honest We're involved in a lie today that is involved that it involves white calling White lives are not considered as valuable as black lives you get whites being fired from positions Vaccines being distributed on the basis of of race Uh, biden is utterly wedded to his phony narrative of of ubiquitous white supremacy he is every executive branch and most preposterously the executive science branches Are distributing science funding on the basis of race not merit they are violating marriageocratic standards Uh, and the fact of the matter is most people go along with this. I mean, I am just stunned At the fact that we all live in this fiction that for instance These elderly asians who have been absolutely Brutalized for the last couple of years that they're being brutalized by whites We see the videos They're being pummeled knockdown Dangled upside down by blacks and yet we all go along with this fiction because whites are so terrified Of looking head-on at the inner city pathological culture that gives rise to these crime disparities And and the mainstream Establishment would rather blame itself for phantom racism Then talk seriously about what is really going on in this country Have we started to see Heather? I'm speaking to Heather mcdonald of them at hatton institute and she's got a new book out when race trumps merit But have we started to see I remember in new york city there was a period back in the 90s when I was a kid when rutie juliani Was was starting to get who did get real support from black leaders in the city and particularly black church leaders preachers People along along those lines for doing what was necessary to Bring public safety up to where it needed to be because that actually saves black lives Have we started to see? Similar movements like that in in any of the democrat cities because in new york for example I have not seen that and I pay pretty close attention there. Is that happening anywhere? No, I you know usually when you ask a question you presume an answer and I would presume that your answer You think is yes, but it takes it cheers that you don't look at what just happened in chicago Uh, you had a runoff between two fairly liberal left-wing democrats paul valus on the one hand and brandon johnson on the other And the one who won Was the most radical anti-police basher who after the recent, you know, annual Marauding down the magnificent mile in chicago can be election got closer, but but it's very clear Uh, he does not support a proactive law enforcement Responding heather. I just you know, I asked I asked you this because I because I haven't seen in new york. I haven't seen it anywhere else It is almost hard to fathom given the levels of violence increase in these cities That this hasn't been occurring the way that it has in previous times in our you know recent history of this country And I I kind of wonder why is I mean it seems to me like the narrative Has gone to a new level because it goes in reverse now Like defund police and all the things that have been done in recent years have resulted in more violence more crime Everything has gotten worse and you go to chicago is the is the perfect case in point. They're saying. Oh, yeah Let's double down on this Yeah, it's the the districts that voted the most Can you know highest numbers for brandon johnson the lefty were black? So i've made a point buck in my writing on police to give voice to those good law abiding Precious people in black communities that beg for more police protection. Those are the people in the new york times Don't listen to on the other hand buck I have to admit that there is still a significant portion of black voters who would rather vote on ideological grounds Oppositional culture of hatred of the police and simply put up with this level of violence now again There are people that are out there organizing on weekends trying to rally the community trying to motivate parents to take control of their Feral youth their children, but the numbers are troubling and and fairly inexplicable and it is as you say we have reached a new level of racial division of racial victimology of strength through victimhood the race hustle At this point is again my mouth hangs open we believe this narrative that That would take them at space valley that black lives matter You know there were there's children in cantha city that have been killed one-year-old tiren paten in 2020 Killed when the car he was riding in was riddled with bullets same year four-year-old legend telefero We shot well sleeping in his father's apartment heart-breaking heart-breaking murders and not a single black lives activist Shows up to protest them because they're all black on black Yeah, it's it's been really troubling to see also you know in the same weekend for example the ralph yarl shooting happened There was a mass shooting at a sweet 16 in alabama killed four people It got about a tenth maybe of the media coverage of the completely non-fatal thankfully shooting of ralph yarl so Again, it's all explained by the grid the grid is the only Crime that the media will talk about is the rare instance where a police officer Harms a black person or a white person harms a black person every other configuration is of no interest whatsoever Uh because we turn our eyes away from the insane drive I should have every single day But dozens of blacks are killed dozens That's more black or 13 percent of the population That's more than all white and Hispanic homicide victims combined on a daily basis after the The the media of the the journal of american medicine Put out a study that said well after the the first 18 months of the pandemic Well translate that as after the george floyd race riots looked at four cities and the rate at which black juveniles were killed in gun homicide was now 100 times the rate at which white juveniles are killed in gun homicide why They're being killed by other blacks And that is why we're never ever going to talk about that Yeah, the dill of the democrat party in the biden white house all the way on down has no interest in looking at the facts about violence In this country and what's really going on check out heather's book everybody when race trumps merit How the pursuit of equity sacrifices excellence destroys beauty and threatens lives heather always appreciate you.
