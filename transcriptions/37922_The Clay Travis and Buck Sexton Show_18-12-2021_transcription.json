Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucks, Sexton show podcast. Welcome in Monday edition clay Travis bucks, Sexton show. Appreciate all of you hanging out with us as we roll closer and closer towards Christmas. And I hope all of you are having a fantastic early Christmas season. We want to talk right off the top here. We've got a loaded show for you. The latest COVID insanity from Jen Psaki and from Dr. Fauci inflation and the impact on Build Back Better. What does the Build Back Better bill actually cost? JK Rowling. Did you see this? Harry Potter creator herself is in a feud over the transgender agenda and how absurdly ridiculous it is. We're going to talk with the Nash to Sousa potentially others. All of that headed your direction. But right off the top here, a lot of discussion about the tornadoes that swept through the Mid-South and Illinois. Late Friday night early Saturday morning across much of the country Kentucky bearing the brunt of that tornado onslaught. And for many of you out there, I know you have seen the videos and seen the tragic results of that tornado line that swept through the Mid-South Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, Illinois, a little bit, all of that area, Alabama and beyond. I was in the middle of that book. Friday night in bed about three o'clock, the storms came through the Nashville, which had fairly significant damage as well. And the whole house got woken up around 2.30 or 3 a.m. Everybody, the tornado sirens are going off. Everybody gets out of bed, put on the television, see where exactly the tornado warnings are. I know a lot of you in our listening area may have ended up in your storm shelter of some form or fashion. Get the kids sometimes if the threats near you, put the pillows and the beds inside of a pantry closet or wherever bathroom, wherever you may been inside the interior of your home. And it's particularly always, it feels like it's a high rate of the time buck when you live in a tornado area that tornado threats come through in the middle of the night, which makes it a little bit scarier because you really can't see what's going on around you. The lightning flashes are going off. And certainly our prayers are with so many people in our listening area who had significant consequences, whose family had significant consequences friends and family lost lives. There were a lot of people inside of some of these Amazon factory warehouses. It appears that we're working when the storms hit. And so for anybody who lives in sort of the tornado universe, the tornado alley Midwest, Mid South where tornadoes come through on a somewhat regular basis, it is regularly chilling, terrifying. Now, a positive buck is that the data reflects that despite all the histrionics, thanks to our ability to forecast tornadoes and severe weather conditions, the number of people dying from severe weather is actually declining, typically over time over the last couple of decades over the last 50 years or so. You wouldn't know it by the way, the media covers it. They immediately jumped to there was a tragedy involving a natural disaster, climate change, almost almost right away. I mean, here's the FEMA director just understand this is Biden's FEMA director. So you don't get this job. You don't get any job in the federal government really, unless you're always spouting the line about climate change. Here she is. This is going to be our new normal and the effects that we're seeing from climate change are the crisis of our generation. We're taking a lot of efforts at FEMA to work with communities to help reduce the impacts that we're seeing from these severe weather events and help to develop system wide projects that can help protect communities. Okay, now let's just start with this is going to be the new normal. No, that's not true. This is an aberrant event based on all the data you can see. This was a particularly bad series of tornadoes, right? But in terms of tornadoes overall and tornado season, you can have data back to 1950. It exists. You can see it's pretty consistent. Sometimes you get a really bad one or you get a few really bad ones. But overall, you have a roughly similar number and of roughly similar severity. There is no trend when they're talking. Remember when they were talking about hurricanes and climate change? You know, after Katrina, it was all my gosh. Oh, okay. Well, when they then they actually looked at the reality of whether this was making hurricanes more frequent. You know, the they'd say things play too. Like the colds are colder. The wetter, wetter, the hotter, hotter. I mean, they'll say this out loud. Like that's not completely absurd. How do you even measure that? What are they even talking about? But it's an opportunity to control people and to assert more of the federal government's spending and power over your life to combat this the same way that, you know, it's the same mentality with having kids sit outside to combat COVID, right? It's not going to do anything, but they're they're making you do it. So it makes them feel better. I mean, even Biden got in on this right away. Yeah, look, it is super political. This is my biggest issue, I would say, with the internet in general, something happens. And the biggest legacy of the internet so far seems to be there's a massive rush to figure out the blame. Something happens. It can be an aberrant, unusual aberration of an event. And immediately it has to be calculated and analyzed. And someone is to blame. We see this every time there is a school shooting, right? Who wants the race of the perpetrator? What did their parents believe? Everything immediately becomes a larger scale story. And I barely had time to wake up the next morning after we were up dealing with the tornadoes during the night with the kids and everything else before I get on social media and am immediately being told this happened because of global war. Right. It's people are are upset. People are in some cases, heartbroken and, you know, have lost their homes, lost perhaps a family member, don't even hardly focus on that. And there's not even a moment of let's all just come together as a as a nation, as a state, as a community, and let's take care of people immediately. Joe Biden starts with the climate change stuff right away without even thinking about it. All that I know is that the intensity of the weather across the board has some impact as a consequence of the warming of the planet and the climate change. The specific impact on these specific storms, I can't say at this point, I'm going to be asking the EPA and others to take a look at that. But the fact is that, Clay, they can't tell specific impact on a specific storm. Are we all supposed to be idiots? One one weather event, they're going to give you the specific impact of climate change on this. And notice how we starts out with the, all I know is that climate change, the warming of the earth, can we just get clarity? Is it warming or is it changing? Because they did the whole changing thing because they didn't have the warming that they needed to show over a period of time. And this goes into my, my, my basic thesis for dealing with the American left today. They're just wrong about everything. They're just wrong about everything. It's, it's just particularly frustrating to have things that cannot be directly correlated, immediately correlated and made political. The focus here should be on helping these communities to get cleaned up. And we know, because many of these communities are listeners of the show, we would encourage anybody out there to be able to do whatever they can to help with the, with the entire cleanup process and everything else. But you know, I live sort of in, in a tornado alley and I will say this, they have gotten incredibly good, incredibly good in terms of weather at notifying you exactly where tornadoes are, exactly what you need to do to try to help and make your family as safe as they possibly can be. And this has been going on my entire life. Tornadoes have been sweeping through the country. And again, what I would point to is thanks to the technology that we have developed to a large extent and probably to homes being built to higher standards on some level, I would imagine that's also helped. The number of people that die from tornadoes and severe, what weather related events are down substantially in the past several decades. Do you think that the average Democrat out there who hears about climate change all the time is aware that fewer people are dying from hurricanes, from tornadoes, from earthquakes, from whatever, severe weather cause as out there, they're down precipitously. I don't think most people are aware of that. There is a sign of strength. Here's the other thing, Buck. Do we really think that we're going to stop tornadoes from happening by something that we do? I mean, that seems to me to be an outrageous claim, which is that if you are arguing that we are responsible for climate change, you're also arguing that based on things that we do, we can diminish the number of tornadoes that are existing. That seems to me to be a rather outlandish claim that whatever we are doing is going to somehow diminish the number of tornadoes. I just, I flat out don't believe that in the same way. You're being willing to change how much it's crazy. It's going to happen. It's crazy. I mean, we all know it's great. This is a, this is nuts. I mean, this is the same, the same line of logic they use to say that we have to have all this money in the Build Back Better plan. We have to spend all this money in the Build Back Better plan for things like tree equity, because that's, you know, that's part of the combating climate change agenda that has inserted into this, the Green New Deal aspects of it. They want to spend a tremendous amount of money, essentially use the climate as an excuse for wealth redistribution. It's just green Marxism instead of a red Marxism. And this is a central tenant now, the Democrat Party. You have people at the Defense Department who are talking about climate change as the primary threat we face. We got Russia maybe about to invade Ukraine. We've got China thinking long and hard about what they could get away with regard to Taiwan. And we have the leadership of the United States military talking about the trans agenda and the Green New Deal and climate change. As if that's something they need to be focused in on. And I actually just was speaking to some friends of mine in the military about this over the weekend. I said, is this really said, yeah, this is absolute. This is absolutely real. It's from the top. Barack Obama gave a speech when he was still commander in chief at the, I think it was the Coast Guard Academy, not Naval Academy, where he said the biggest threat the military faces, the biggest national national security, specific national security threat was climate change. I mean, this is, this is a lunacy, right? This is, but it's the same mindset of people that think that the apparatus of the elites is on their side. So it doesn't matter if basic common sense can lie to see through it right away. And this is what we have here. And it's also, it's also just gross. Like something horrible has just happened. And we should all just take a moment to say, let's find everybody, get everybody help, get everybody back on their feet. You know, it's your community, Claire, right? I mean, it's right in your, your backyard. Instead of that being the focus, even for a week, we have Biden muttering about climate change and the FEMA director doing the same. It's gross. Well, and it's also emblematic of larger human failures. Throughout history, mankind has tried to in some way influence the weather. I mean, throughout history, I mean, if you look at, uh, at the way that, uh, that, that Stonehenge may have been built, if you look at what the Mayans did, it was all related to celestial heavenly events and very often needing more rain, needing less rain, uh, and how the climate overall impacts their ability to have a, uh, a normal harvest and a normal life. And there's a, there's a, uh, a lack of human control that is embedded still in the idea that we can control the weather and we can't. And so the concept that if we spend more money on green new deal, somehow tornadoes and hurricanes are going to become less likely, is frankly absolute Baldur dash.

Show in a mask is this where we're headed excuse me clay a double mask sir because I take the virus seriously you know I share this on Twitter everyone has just forgotten about this fauci that evil little elf of the bad guy not what have said is elves he's running around if he gives us presents all they have are masks and coal in the in the stocking and he he was wearing remember this ostentatiously double masked for like up two months what happened we're having a rise in cases where's all the double masking and even cited some bull crap study you know that doctor Scott Atlas in his book points out that one of the primary studies the mask fanatics rely on is it even really a study it's an observational study i.e. a story that was told about a woman who was a you know woman hairdresser who wore a mask while she was giving people you know hair treatment and they said well they didn't she didn't spread it to all of them first of all it's very unlikely she'd spread it to more than one person second well you know they didn't even follow up and test all the participants oh of course not they didn't even know so they're just saying well we heard about a woman who was giving you know hair hair color treatment or whatever and she didn't give it to all of her clients therefore the mask okay so we can come back in most in a second but i just my friends we're going to talk about the outdoor situation with children who have to sit in freezing cold temperatures adults who are you know at much higher risk and i'm talking about older adults can sit inside in New York at a bar by the way i say god bless go for it i'm all for this but they can do that but kids we're going to talk about that at a moment mask mandate clay no i want to see the New York Times editorial board trying to defend a mask mandate at this point as if it works i want to see these little commies have to actually make the argument publicly i know we got a doc of meteorologist we've got tom in st. Paul, Minnesota what's up sir tom in st. Paul, Minnesota go in once go in twice all right i mean there are there are yeah now we're here let's go team sorry about sorry about that guys okay so i just wanted to state the fact that the strongest tornadoes the f3 ef3s to ef5s have gone down considerably since the 1950s across the United States from 1954 to 1985 we were averaging almost 56 of them a year and today we're averaging about just over 30 per year so the strongest tornadoes are going down greatly and that's because uh kind of uh indirectly here it's probably or perhaps because we have warmed a bit um and with the the lack of contrast of temperatures from north to south across the northern hemisphere that tends to weaken storm so i'm i i'm either you know are you a meteorologist i am i am yes i am oh so that's fantastic thank you for calling in and giving us that data buck nearly a 50 decline in the severity of tornado uh issues it's amazing. November's financial numbers were released on friday only confirm what we're feeling financially everything is more expensive they've been lying to you about how bad inflation is going to be how long it's going to be bad the value of the dollars in your bank account are going down it is shrinking in value that's why we suggest you invest a portion of your savings in real gold not only does it protect the value of your savings account but it's a tangible precious metal you can take actual physical possession of and it's not a complicated process my friends at the oxford gold group are who you need to call they'll have real gold delivered to your home call them at 833-404 gold i learned how you can have real gold in your ira and delivered to your door that's the oxford gold group 833-404 gold 833-404 G-O-L-D the oxford gold group 833-404 gold bucksexit on the EIB network welcome back in clait your have us bucksexit the christmas music man i don't know about you buck but i always think first of all merry christmas to everybody i don't want to sound like ebonies or scrooge here but i always think you ever look at the ratings for radio christmas music this is why we play christmas music we did it on the sports talk show too and i've been making this argument for like over a decade we should all just take the month of december off and just play christmas music because christmas music kicks everybody's ass in the ratings for like the basically all of december and so it really is amazing if you look at the numbers how much desperate demand there is for christmas music when people are driving around in their car does that ever surprise you look i i'm a i'm a like the classics kind of guy so some of the funky stuff you hear in these days of christmas music look whatever gets people in the mood in the spirit as far as i concerned so i'll be the grinch then uh we uh by the way i've got a lot of great callers uh calling in to talk about the data behind tornadoes and uh we want to encourage you guys by the way you can go to redcross.org that's the simplest way to make donations for all of the tornado victims uh redcross.org super simple super easy you can target your donation towards many people all over the mid state mid south uh kentucky tenoncy missippi alabama illinois and others that had significant issues over the course of the weekend but i believe we have a storm chaser online here buck who wants to talk and by the way great call we just has went to break that since the 1950s the number of strong tornadoes EF 3 4 and 5s he said has declined from an average of 56 a year down to 30 and the overall number of deaths from tornadoes thankfully has declined as well uh let's go to that storm chaser yeah uh we get well we got a storm chaser scott in norman oklahoma scott how you doing hey guys hey not bad are you so how long you been chasing storms man i mean that sounds like the movie twister yeah well i've been chasing for about 20 years now uh i haven't uh unfortunately see uh the destruction uh from the job of mazuri tornado 18 2013 more oklahoma tornado here uh so i've seen uh i've seen uh quite a bit of destruction unfortunately throughout my chasing career so when you're chasing just for contextualized for everybody out there uh you see the tornado how is chasing a tornado differ in daylight versus night and what are you trying to do as a storm chaser how close to this storm do you guys typically get well uh chasing during the daytime obviously it's going to be easier because you can see it you're not relying on lighting flashes or power line arcs or surges when the tornado is hitting power lines to see the tornado uh and that's that unfortunate nighttime that's the only way you can really see the tornado coming um and uh one of the goals of the storm chaser is to uh report to the national weather service they're the ones that are uh you know issuing all those warnings and uh getting the getting the warning out there and uh um so we do our best to try to get those uh confirm uh what we're seeing out in the field so the weather service can better warn the storms and more accurately warn the storms so is the data correct based on your knowledge that the number of severe tornadoes has declined uh as we have moved into the 2020s the number of e3 four and fives that's what a meteorologist just called and and told us does that confirm uh with what your understanding of the data would be yes and especially in the past 10 years uh the severe tornadoes are actually declined uh um but i've noticed that we haven't had a tornado outbreak uh and up until uh a couple days ago uh in several i'd say about five years uh we haven't had a major outbreak and technically this season wasn't even a technically a tornado outbreak where we had a family of tornadoes it was only one storm that went over 250 miles that was producing either a family of tornadoes or one single tornado on the ground so when you say i'm not kind of fascinated by this when you say a series of tornadoes you're talking about different tornadoes that are erupting in different states that are from different storm systems which differs from this one based on what i've read because this was one massive tornado that went over 200 miles and wreaked havoc across multiple states uh what you're talking about is a series of different tornadoes that are being sprouted out of the same storm system am i right about that that is correct yeah now there was i do want to confer uh uh reassure or go back and say that uh there was another tornadic storm in uh illinois and i'm not talking about that one i know that was a separate storm uh the the one i'm talking about uh went from arkansas actually started in little rock uh as there uh a thunder just a regular thunderstorm and moved across uh into the boot hill of mazuri and continued on into uh kentucky and by the time it got to about jones burrow arkansas when it really started to uh put down a very large tornado that we witnessed and reported in um and so that that's that's the one that that that storm kept going just continuously and so scott i i know initially just just to get i know initially you call then because you want to talk to us about how it's really structures that make a huge difference here in terms of the engineering of the structures that people are in live in during a tornado can you can you go into some about how how that makes the big difference here right yeah so um uh your your structures uh tornadoes reveal how strong a structure and how well the structure is built uh and so if it doesn't matter how strong or weak the tornado was if it destroys a building more than likely if it flattens it more than likely that building wasn't built very well and in these days a lot of buildings you know the the codes are a lot better now than they work back then uh so people are slightly safer now and do know in kentucky there is over 60 deaths at that candle factory there in may still kentucky um so in a building like that you know you can't there's nothing you can do this you can't really take shelter anywhere in that large warehouse it's just not built to withstand uh violent tornadoes so uh you know i know that i'm sure the media is talking about how the deaths are going up from more violent tornadoes but that's just not the fact it's you know it's these are you know just freak events where the tornadoes just happen to hit uh towns that haven't been hit in a long time and those structures aren't up to code you know and and the 20-wheeler will reveal that. Scott thanks for calling in from Norman, Oklahoma storm chaser um grant in outer banks north carolina and environmental engineer look at the audience we have your clay it's amazing people we got listening go ahead hey guys uh did us to you and did us to rush in heaven mega dido sir thank you yeah this is like 25 years uh first time i ever called in but um yeah my you know my liberal friends they hyperventilate about this global warming and it just gets so nauseating i just kind of remind them and look we don't have enough data on this earth uh to extrapolate out and say that the earth is burning up that the earth is warming and some you know dismal trend um we know that the earth has cycles you know like the sine waves and we've had cooling periods and we've had warming periods you know most of those by the way were probably set off by major cataclysmic events you know like a you know series of asteroids or giant uh um volcano erupting like uh Yellowstone like the whole damn state blew up you know um but yeah think about it bouncing hell put more co2 in the air than the ice is probably produces in 20 years in one event you know so um if the earth is you know 26 billion years old or 40 billion however old it is you know we're looking at data from like what the last 300 years a couple hundred years of recorded data and even if we use geological data and go back 5 000 years you're still looking at such a sliver of information it's impossible to say that yeah we're having this global warming i don't know al gore he said something a long time ago and people like al gore for for some reason i don't know and it's all so crazy man thanks for calling in i appreciate it appreciate it thanks so much clay and i uh thank you for your time stuck i want to give your

military welcome back to clay and buck show my friends we have author filmmaker podcaster jennesh fa\u00e7uza coming up in just a few minutes with us to talk about the gelain maxwell trial which has gotten very little attention compared to what you would think if we were just uh looking at this in advance and given how much we've had mega trials dominating news coverage of the last couple of months this one really seems to be getting lost in the shuffle and i don't think it's an accident and neither does denesh and we'll be talking about that in a few minutes but uh denesh is also a best best-selling author speaking of best-selling authors you like that clay sweet that's that's how we roll speaking of best-selling authors we have jk rally i have never read a harry potter book oh i was wow how is that possible i cuz i read real books clay what do you mean i was possible i read harry i read the harry potter books while i was in law school so that i had something you're reading all this serious stuff all day long and then as i would get ready for bed i had the harry potter books beside my bed to kind of take me outside of serious talk i worked with a couple of super serious people back in my government days and i will say they swore they were like in their 30s and they swore by the not only i mean they love harry potter there were people that came across you're not the only one but also well what was the book about the werewolf teenager and the what i mean the vampire teenagers yeah i didn't read those there were uh twice twilight series okay all right there's why there's a reeve empires yeah there's there's a clay's like the real guys read you know reherry potter not the other well so i've now read it with my kids so the kids uh also great kids books when you have kids so i'm still surprised that you haven't read any twilight contingent of this audience clay is shaking their heads at you right now how dare you not celebrate what percentage of our audience do you think has read twilight versus harry potter i bet it's a huge percentage on parry potter i would i would guess you know 10 maybe 10 maybe a way higher no way higher no way there's a lot of grandparents there's a lot of parents and then we got we see the data a lot of younger people who grew up reading harry potter i would bet it's at least 25 or 30 percent twilight weight lower that was that that's that's a good digit for sure that's probably low end single digits all right but let's get to jk rallen because there's a reason why i brought her up other than the fact that now i'm gonna have to read the harry potter series over my vacation here just so clay and i have something we can uh dive into jk rallen causing controversy here according to the new york post why because of trans phobia they are saying it's ridiculous she went i mean this so they they keep on telling us it's not a big deal why do you care why is it an issue when we talk about the trans agenda well she wrote war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength and the um am i allowed to say that on air i don't know the individuals with male genitalia that i'm allowed to say who rape you is a woman that is what she tweeted right i noticed how you were quiet i'm i allowed to say that it's can you say the the the p-word or you can say penis you can say penis on the radio okay all right so there we go um case anybody was wondering and that yes wait so so here's the so everyone understands the issue is scottish police because he after remember i love brave heart and scotland is like this imaginary wonderful place in our minds from history and everything else scotland's a bunch of socialist commies now just remember that they run the country ever in scotland wants the governor to pay for everything all their health care whatever scottish police play are now logging individuals who claim to be transgender but have done nothing officially to transition as women in rape cases where there is so they're now being officially logged by police when a man rapes a woman and says i'm actually transgender the claim is enough they log that as a female uh you know a female perpetrated rape and jk rallying has a problem with that because she's not completely insane and now they say she's transphobic again i give credit to jk rallying for being willing and again her tweet i think is significant because what it says is we're all being told told things that we know are fundamentally untrue war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength the penest individual who raped you is a woman with a link to what's going on in parts of the uk she's scottish i think lived in scotland for substantial amounts of her life i think that's where she started writing the harry potter books in edenborough if i'm not mistaken but the idea that you are accused of rape and you tell a police officer actually i'm a woman and they log you if you are a man who was accused of raping a woman as a woman who has committed a rape even though you have as you said mel jennet tell you i mean it's all insane and it ties in honestly with what we were talking about last week and what some of my writers at out kick were on top of which is the idea that this biological man who has decided to become a woman is setting all these different records now and doing it as a women's swimmer and i give credit to jk rallying because many celebrities buck won't even say anything about these absurdities because they're terrified of exactly happening to her what's happening which is she's getting attacked like crazy and understand everybody she's a lib and probably a socialist even though she's a billionaire like she advocates for big government socialist policies but she also is a feminist of some sort or things of herself in that way and recognizes that the the real uh end truth or the end state of what the left pushes for is in a sense the erasure of women i mean women no longer are a category that makes it women are are an idea and not a physical reality which even as i say that it sounds like i should be in a room with padded walls and yet this is mainstream thinking among the democrat party here in america and among the left uh in the west more broadly and i just think that jk rallying deserves some credit for standing up on woody clay against the heat on this one everything they tell
