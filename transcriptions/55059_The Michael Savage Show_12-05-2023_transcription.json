Hello and welcome to the Michael Savage podcast. Today we go off the beaten path. There's so much terrible news out there. And I could talk about title 42. I could talk about immigration. I could do all of it. But I want to do something different for you today to get your mind off it. I want to take you to another world. And it may not be a pretty world. It'll be a dark world. It's a future world. An anti utopian world. An anti utopian new world run by militant feminists. Let me backtrack for you for a minute. I published a sci fi novel called Xenon a while ago. It's on Kindle. And you could enjoy it by downloading it there. You're going to get a piece of it for free here. I'd like you to support my writing by downloading it from Kindle if you want and not going to get rich. But it'll show that there's an audience for intelligence out there. But first the word about xenon if I may in the new world order. Because I was, well, I have news for you out there that no one knows about yet. I've hinted at it on podcasts. A major university has agreed to acquire my papers, my writings, my mementos, my recordings, my plant collections. There's been going on for over a year. I've been working with this library. It's one of the greatest literary libraries in the world. And I won't mention it for obvious reasons right now. It's not the right time. But they have the largest collection of some of the most famous authors on earth, even though it's a liberal university, as all of them are, apparently the scholarly parts of these universities have not yet been contaminated. And they recognize the value of certain individuals. So in going through all of my archives and my writings, I stumble upon letters and correspondence over the years. And I mean, there's a lot of it. And one day I'll tell you more about it. And in it, I come upon the TypeScript for xenon, which you don't hear on the tape you're about to hear from Kindle. I want to read you one paragraph about xenon. So you get hooked. Are you ready? Page six, spoken by the current ruler of the Eastern region, a bird like Raven lady was shaved head. This talk outlined the seven steps to overcoming quote male dominated interest areas on quote. It was now being argued where the men had the right to retain their dominance in boxing and football. Some of the more radical group argued that biology was no excuse. And that surgical or pharmacologic intervention was now called for to further quote democratize the nation. Unquote. If the creator is a pig like man, there's no reason we can't recreate his creations went to progressive line. For those of you who can follow what I'm saying to you, I wrote this in 1981, when I had this dark vision of the future. It's called xenon. And it's on Kindle. And I'm going to give you some of it for free today. The rest of it's downloadable. And I'll tell you about xenon in a minute. I got to backtrack a little bit further in my search for the library that has acquired my literary papers. I found this letter from a very famous literary editor in New York City in 2019 to my then agent. And he writes this first a word about xenon. He writes when I attended the clarion SF writers workshop in 1976, which was led by such luminaries as Damon Knight, Tom dish, Joanna Russ and Joe Haldeman. I was taught that the first sentence of an SF novel that means science fiction should create a world, a character and a conflict. In short, the sentence should blow the reader's mind. Michael does this with his hilarious list of acronyms and cast of characters. The brief chapters reveal only as much as they need to in order to move the story forward. While behind this, the reader is invited to decode the outlines of the larger society of which xenon is a part, the object of Michael's social political satire is clear. Even if that society never quite comes into focus, it is at time so bold and so prophetic that it makes my eyes water as though I were peeling an onion. In this regard, he writes, I have to side with the majority of his Amazon commenters in regarding this is a sketch or a set of finger exercises that deserves to be fleshed out into something a bit more substantial. He goes on and says, but what I find most promising is the writing itself. It's extreme spairness combined with its cunning manipulation of the reader's expectations of normalcy. Place it in the category of the mind bending political fables produced by writers of the Soviet era. That's a hell of a line, by the way, folks, fables produced by writers of the Soviet era. It's chilling when you think about it. There is a scene in one of Andre Sineovsky's books where the secret police burst into a writer's apartment, sweep the letters off the page he has been writing onto the table, and then put them in a tidy little envelope before leaving many of the letters of the of the actual TypeScript. This kind of surrealism is an appropriate response to a society where truth and meaning have been twisted into lies for political ends. Michael seems to be channeling these dissonant authors as well as dystopian SF writers like J. G. Ballard, Philip Dick, and RA Lafferty. I would love to see Michael go back to this piece and expand it since currently its impact is limited by an incomplete account of the technology of social control, the role of noble gases and the specific conflict Zenon is trying to resolve. Let's encourage him to do so. He continues by saying this to my agent now in a larger sense. I am now thinking of Michael as in part a project of archival rediscovery. It seems to me that he has written a great deal of content over the years that ought to be packaged and published in appropriate forms for different audiences. I'd like to help him do this. And then he goes on to talk about an advance, which I'm not going to talk about. And then he says other stuff that's too personal for me to put in here. What you've just heard is an email from July 30th 2019 from a major New York literary editor to my agent about my little novella xenon XENON, which is now available on Kindle. So what is xenon? Well, in a few minutes, I'll be reading from it. If you only hear the whole thing, of course, you can do so by downloading it on Kindle. And here's some notes I wrote about this xenon. I had to write a little synopsis. And to the future world state, an anti utopian New World run by militant fatasses, FA dash T dash ASES, parentheses, FSS on parentheses, who castrate males assign them life mates who are transsexual, keeping the unclip quote natural women for the state security forces SSF to assist the women in charge WIC state mindbogglers SMs, delete memories and secretly use state gas stores of the noble gases to quote, re molecularize their minds are gone free on helium, Krypton, neon, radon and xenon. envisioned and written in the early 1980s. This prophetic fantasy forecast Michael savages semi serious alarm of a nightmarish future. In the New World, there are no natural free people. This science fiction adventure is considered a masterpiece of wit and dark humor that accurately predicted the direction of the fem dominated Stalinist states now emerging in former Western democracies. If you don't understand prophecy, I don't think you should listen to the rest of this podcast. Some of us are gifted with prophecy. Some of us are gifted with vision. Some of us can be called visionaries. That's all I have to say at this point. We're now going to go to a small piece that I did on the radio was if I could find that for you. I think you'll like that one. It's an audio clip about me discussing how I was inspired to write scene on when it happened. I was at a shopping mall in the early 1980s. This is before radio. Remember that I began radio in 94 and I envisioned the future world of radical feminists that cast straight males. It's a few minutes long. I think you're going to enjoy listening to it. And then after that, we'll come back and I'll actually read from the novella zine on itself. And then after that, we're going to give you another treat, which is about the demise of our cities. I know what's a treat about that. Because the other day I treated the following, I asked the question on Twitter, what do you miss most about your town or city that has been decimated in the past few Biden years? And I said, coming soon, what I miss about San Francisco. And I'm going to read to you what I miss about my city and what people miss about their cities and what's happened to this country. I read just today an article in the independent Institute about San Francisco falling into the abyss. And it says, no major American city has failed at the same level as Detroit, whose population dropped from 1.85 million people in 1950 to about 630,000 today. And the writer Lee Oh, Hainan says, move over Detroit. Here comes San Francisco, which lost 6.3% of its population between 2019 and 2021, a rate of decline larger than any two year period in Detroit's history, and unprecedented among any major US city. Now, of course, the progressives who left us will argue that it was a result of the pandemic, but it's not true. It's driven by bad local economic policies. If you've been to this city, which I loved so much, blocks have been taken over by immigrant drug gangs selling fentanyl and open air superstores. And the city supervisors spend their time talking about the funding police, abolishing rent, abolishing prisons, and don't allow any new box stores to open in the city. They demanded of Whole Foods open a grocery store in a vacant building in this failing city. It must include affordable housing. Well, Whole Foods just left the city. Every business is leaving the city. Yes, yes, I know some blame San Francisco's high cost of living for the exodus. Yeah, well, that contributes to some of the loss. But many of the people leaving the city include those with high incomes who can still afford to live here. But they're choosing to move to other states and other cities, which are also expensive, but have great governance like Miami on the Rhonda Santas between 2019 and 2021, San Francisco lost nearly $7 billion of household income, even after accounting for those who moved into the city. Downtown foot traffic declined about 64% compared to 2019. Empty office buildings could cause San Francisco $200 million a year in lost property taxes. My friends, it's a country in decline because of Biden and his left wing goon squad. Make no mistake about it. They're destroying the country city by city. And it's only just begun. In addition to destroying the cities by catering to the sacred cows called the homeless violence, the whole most the violent homeless catering to them, making them sacred cows. You know, my feelings on that. Now they're bringing in millions of illegal aliens, many of whom are gangbangers. All of this and more right here on the Michael Savage podcast coming up next after this break will be my reading from Xenon and then reading from people's comments on what they miss most about their town or city that has been decimated in the past few Biden years. Tell me if you can get any of this on any other podcast. I'd like to know if you can because I don't think so. Michael Savage, a host like no other.

Hi, this is Rachel Yucatel and I'm here to invite you to listen to my podcast Misunderstood with Rachel Yucatel. This podcast delves into the lives of those who have been reduced to a single headline. Each episode will take a closer look at the stories of those who are on a mission to change their narrative. Join me as we uncover the truth behind the misconceptions, shed light on the stories of those who have perhaps been wrongfully portrayed, explore the complexities of the human experience and celebrate the power of second chances. Who doesn't love a good comeback story? One thing that's very exciting to me and if it's exciting to me, it may be of interest to you, which is the publication on Kindle of my little science fiction book called Xenon X-E-N-O-N and I rushed it. I've been holding it for years. I've got to tell you right now. I wrote this in 82, 83, 84, 85. I remember the day I started to write it. I remember the day I conceived that I was in a mall in a community, a white community, a suburban white community, north of San Francisco in an outdoor mall and I was looking at the people who looked like robots to me. The people, the women who were shopping just looked robotic, which they are. They looked like stepford wives with shopping bags, no soul, glazed over eyes, licking ice cream cones, drinking coffee, and I saw a future world of mindless, soulless people going to malls and buying in stores that repeated each other, iterations of the same store, 15 makeup stores that sell the same garbage, that kind of thing. Over and over again, the same thing. So I envision the future world that might happen and it's a dystopian or anti-utopian world, as I saw it, run by militant feminists who cast straight males. I remember it's science fiction. Okay, don't get excited. Assign them life mates who are transsexual and they keep the unclipped natural women for the state security forces, the SSF, to assist the women in charge WIC. State mind bogglers, SMs, delete memories, and secretly use state gas stores and the noble gases to re-molecularize their minds. In other words, the feminists who are running the world secretly inhale argon freon helium crypton neon. In the new world there are no natural free people. This science fiction adventure is considered a masterpiece of wit and dark humor that accurately predicted the direction of the femme dominated Stalinist states emerging in former Western democracies. In vision and written in the early 1980s, this prophetic fantasy forecast is Michael Savage's semi-serious alum of a nightmarish future. I don't know whether people are going to go for it or not, but I believe it's an important Jonathan Swift type of book. Let's put it to you that way. And it was based upon a lot of Jonathan Swift's insights to the society of his time. In a sense, I mean, not copying Jonathan Swift, but it was what Jonathan Swift did in his time. I try to do in my time. The cover art is one of my watercolors, one of my primitive childish watercolors. I have maybe two dozen of them that I will release at a time in the future during a phase I was painting very heavily about a year or two ago. And the watercolors from artists who have looked at them are considered to be of interest to some people. They're simple and they're primitive. I understand that, but nevertheless, they're unique and of some interest. I took one of them and made it the cover art to Xenon. Maybe you want to check it out on Kindle and says get on any device or whatever. What I love about this is I didn't have to go through a whole editorial board. I wasn't looking for an advance. I wasn't looking for a marketing campaign. It's a very complicated thing public. And I have the greatest publisher in the world, the absolute greatest publisher. I've had one hit after another with them. Trump's war, God, faith in reason, they're the best, absolutely the best. And they put their heart and soul into my books. And I really appreciate it. This is simple. It's a different kind of thing. It is a short science fiction fantasy. So if you want to take that rollercoaster with me, go ahead and check it out. All right. Now we go into the body of the sci-fi xenon in the world order by Michael Savage, written in the early 80s, somewhere in a mall in America. Well, let's begin with the table of contents that the editor loved so much list of acronyms from the New World Order actually, you're not going to reach the table of contents. And if you want to actually read the book, you go to Kindle and you support the show by downloading it for a few bucks list of acronyms from the New World Order list of characters list of noble gases xenon enters the master petroleum xenon enters his dwelling xenon goes to the mall. They walk to the carousel Sam Ayers home, they break into the old brewery xenon fights a hangover less fights a hangover xenon visits a fish store and a mastermatorium. I can't wait to read it.

So here we go list of characters xenon a 12th in man who's mind has been altered by the state to delete certain memories dealing with the assassination of a radical rabbi by an Arab planted in the country. Hmm. Now that's interesting. You wouldn't expect that would you?

Now some of this has been deleted from the original typescript. I could see that I've edited this down. Maybe I should read you the original. Hmm. Yeah. No, this is old. It's when xenon enters a master Batorium and I said the real the Romans had their vomitoria the French have their pissoire we have our cubicles to masturbate in well we don't have cubicles anymore. That's simply the the internet. So we go to the beginning of the booklet or the novel infinitely boring thought xenon as he rode the far screen cable capsule over the bay. Another day in the city ruled by mean lesbians on every street corner in those despicable uniforms with their fat ASS ES clubs and keys butchers faces came to xenon's mind box.

bring me back some of larenzo's gorana lo z will need a real joel tonight page five xenon goes to the mall being glory ember it was still bright and warm even at seven o'clock that evening xenon enjoyed airing over to the maul at dusk to get out of the house while less mess the kitchen preparing dinner also to take in the mannequins and all the primary colors most of the stores were empty of people but overflowing with goods the young shop attendance essays were all men between the ages of 18 to 25 by state decree women of this age group shunted into more important work the economy had never recovered from the last world oil war hmm wow called wow three so the large chain stores found in such satellite shopping walls were largely showcases owned by foreign money xenon had heard rumors about some distant planetary investments but chose to ignore this after all i'm not xenophobic he thought gazing at his own reflection in the window of the talk store he saw a wispy figure slightly stooped with frightened eyes the new titles on display were almost all success stories by women executives pilots military officers and the like i did it was number one on the best cello list

reading from xenon on kindle you can buy it on kindle copyrighted 1991 and I think I'll break here because the next chapter is they walk to the carousel and if you want to know how the story emerges this doc lee humorous sci-fi novella years ahead of its time got a great agent in new york and a great editor in new york said or reminded them it reminded them of what is this what the remind them of huh so prophetic that it makes my eyes water as I were peeling an onion extreme spareness blah blah blah so this is pretty good it says this science fiction novel has created a world a character and a conflict that blows the reader's mind and it invites the listener or the reader to read more but this is the line I like the most what I find most promising wrote the editor is the writing itself it's extreme spareness combined with its cunning manipulation of the reader's expectations of normalcy place it in the category of the mind-bending political fables produced by writers of the Soviet era well let me pause right there the Soviet era hmm well here we are in the new Soviet era on the joe biden not to get too political at that I think I'll pause and come back shortly right here on the michael savage podcast where I will read to you from listeners who have written what they miss most about america since biden destroyed one city after the other be right back be here be nowhere most

burned down i miss the pizza and the incredible architecture yeah well that's true i live in florida can't complain about anything certain parts it would not walk alone but so far i feel pretty safe yes that's because florida's a good ceiling carry state florida's run by the santas not by the goons who run the other states another one says my town is basically a bedroom community in a rural area

i miss chicago i mean my chicago when i was raised in the seventies and eighties even through the nineties kids still played at parks in front of our homes until the street lights came on then the rise of stealing your own lawn and home with a ceiling your own home and lawn with an iron gate was an omen to us of things to come he sure we had crime but it was also dealt with we had many more police stations and boy we had some rough cops say what you want but we hardly wanted to get in trouble with the law because they dealt with crime fiercely that gave room for our parents to thrive as they see fit property taxes were affordable you get the picture tough cops tough on crime i missed a new car dealers with plenty of cars to shop from i miss the endless optimism of the youth experience to my town i miss the fact that there are no reporters left on local news i miss gentrification and how the left is trying to tie white supremacy with it and i wrote to dem slums are cool and diverse hmm let's see what else is anything else now you get the picture and i'll close by telling you what i miss about San Francisco let's play uh we can play Tony Bennett i left my life in San Francisco because he never sang that he sang he sounded fiction about i left my heart in San Francisco now it's become a literal statement rather than a figurative statement because if you walk in downtown San Francisco in certain areas you will leave your heart in San Francisco in the street i was thinking about that the other night folks those of you who love my podcast and have known me for so many years i remember going to aliyota's restaurant since shuttered it's an institution been there since 1924 family restaurant gone gone decimated not only by the pandemic but by many other factors i used to like to go in there once a month twice a month i sit at the bar at the end of a day after a radio show i like to start with a drink at the bar looking down at the waterfront i'd look at the uss pomperno which is a submarine from the world world war ii era and i would envision the streets filled with sailors and soldiers in world war ii i could actually see them in my imagination walking on fisherman's waff with their favorite girl smiles on their brave faces i miss that i guess i left my heart in San Francisco this is michael savage you might say this was a chillingly
