    "text": " We all know that testosterone is one of the key hormones that drives much of our masculine behavior. What you may not know is that testosterone levels are trending downward for men of all ages, and while those who see lower testosterone levels in themselves are racing towards replacement therapy, there are many natural ways to address T levels. Today I'm joined by neuroscientist Christopher Walker to talk about testosterone levels, the importance of micronutrients in our diet, the role of the thyroid and pituitary gland in regulating hormonal levels, training, supplementation, and ultimately how to master your testosterone levels. You're a man of action. You live life to the fullest, embrace your fears, and boldly charge your own path. When life knocks you down, you get back up one more time, every time. You are not easily deterred or defeated, rugged, resilient, strong. This is your life. This is who you are. This is who you will become at the end of the day, and after all is said and done, you can call yourself a man. Gentlemen, what is going on today? My name is Ryan Mickler and I am the host and the founder of this podcast and movement that is Order of Man. I want to welcome you today. If you're brand new, I want to welcome you. If you've been with us for any amount of time, this is an incredible revolution. It's returned back to a time when men were masculine, who were strong, we were committed, we were dedicated, we were driven and motivated and ambitious, and everything else you'd probably consider your grandpa. Quite frankly, to be like, this is a call to return back to a time when we were that way. And I'm so honored that so many of you are in this journey and in this battle with me. I certainly couldn't do it without you. And my ultimate goal is to bring you the tools and the conversations and guidance and direction and resources that you need in order to step more fully into your role as a father, a husband, a business owner, a community leader, and every other area of life that you're showing up. So, we have conversations on this podcast. I've got a great one lined up for you today with Christopher Walker. We've also had guys like David Goggins, Jocka Willing, Grant Cardone, Andy Forcilla, TJ Dilla Shaw, Tim Kennedy, I mean, the list goes on and on with the incredible, incredible and inspiring men that we've had on this podcast. And it's only going to get better as you continue to join us in this battle and also share. And I would ask that you do please share this movement, share this podcast, leave a rating and review. Those are two very easy ways that you can let others know what we're doing here. So, I'm going to get into the show here in just a second. But one of the things I wanted to make a mention of is my friends and our show sponsors. Now, before I tell you about these guys over at Origin, I do have to say I've been getting an uptick in emails from potential podcast sponsors all wanting to hawk their products and their wares and everything else. And guys, you won't find that here because I think it's disingenuous. It's not our model. Frankly, I'm not interested in just talking a bunch of products that really don't move the needle and helping you become a better man. And that's exactly why I talk about Origin main so much is because I think Jujitsu will help you be a better man. And that's what these guys are all about. They're all about helping you with rash guards, with geez, with training apparel. They've got their supplemental lineup, jockos, joint warfare, super-crill, mulk, discipline. All of these things designed to help you increase your ability to be a better Brazilian Jujitsu tacticianer. And like I said before, I think that will help you be a better man. It certainly has helped me. So, if you're interested in what these guys are doing, 100% made in American products, then check them out. Originmain.com. Main is in the state main. Originmain.com and use the code order. Or D-E-R at checkout for a discount. Again, originmain.com and the code order at checkout. All right, guys, with that said, I want to introduce you to my guest. I think a lot of you probably know who this is. His name is Christopher Walker. He is a neuroscientist who has been independently studying health and fitness and testosterone for over a decade. He's the author of Master Your Tea, which I think, and I'm looking at it right now, is probably the definitive guide to increasing and boosting your testosterone levels in a natural and safe way. Him and I met years ago and I've been following his work and implementing his programs in my life ever since. And I've seen drastic improvements in my health and fitness and nutrition. And I think he's arguably one of the foremost authorities on how hormonal levels impact men. And today he's here to talk with us about how that happens and how we can improve our T levels naturally and safely. Christopher, what's up, man? Glad to have you back on. I had you what I had a conversation with you two weeks ago and we decided we needed to redo the whole thing, right? Yep. Yep. Got to make sure the quality is good. Yeah, which I mean, that's the biggest thing is we want to make sure that the guys who are listening get the most out of it. And the conversation that we talked about a couple of weeks ago was so powerful that I just want to make sure we painted it in the best light possible for the guys. Yeah, I'm happy to keep riffing on it, get back into it and make this episode even better. Yeah, and it's so important. I mean, it's something that I think inherently a lot of guys know when we're talking about the effects and the power of testosterone in our lives. And yet I see so many guys rush to, I don't want to say quick fix, but rush towards, you know, like testosterone replacement therapy. And although I believe there's probably a time and a place for that, I think the lower hanging fruit is just to do this right and do it naturally. Yeah, I think you see that really with any anything in general, if you have, if there's like a gap between your own understanding and the reality, then it's common for people to want to just take something at face value of like, some authority told me this or that. And I'll just go with this quick thing without fully understanding what the actual ramifications of that really are. That's probably just basic human behavior. Well, and it's a fine line too, because in a lot of ways, we should be turning to experts and authorities and those who maybe have things figured out. But that doesn't absolve us of the responsibility we have to understand some of these things for ourselves, especially when we're talking about messing with our biology and our hormones and these critically important systems that our bodies use to operate in life. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, yeah, anything like mess around with your biology is it has far more far reaching ramifications than any of us know. Everything is connected in your body. So in the law of compensation, we'll always take effect, especially in your body. Explain that to me. The law, would you say compensation? Compensation. Yeah, like if you, I mean, one way to think about it is the Newtonian way of thinking about of like, every action has equal and opposite reaction or opposite force. Yeah, sure. The other, the other idea is like a pendulum swinging. So especially with health and dieting and everything like that, that's a good metaphor for it. If a lot of people with their health, they'll go to extremes, right? So they'll take things to one end. And the way I view it in my mind is like, if you're basically just pulling, if you picture an old, old timey, old timey clock, like grandfather clock kind of thing, you're pulling that pendulum to one side and just unnaturally holding it there. When, when it's natural thing is to want to be in this rhythm and you're just holding it to one side. And what's happening is it's going to swing no matter what, like eventually the, the compensation will happen. It's just the farther you pull that pendulum to one side, the farther it's going to swing to the other end. And especially with biology, there's all these compensatory mechanisms in the body that a lot of us don't even really truly understand, like even even people that devote their lives to uncovering the truth about the human body and the brain and that sort of thing. It's just all like this new stuff. So there's such a lack of understanding that to play with fire in the way that a lot of people do with pharmaceuticals is, I definitely wouldn't advise it to say the least. Yeah. I mean, and the other thing too though is truth is such an interesting word because when we hear it, I think what we obviously think of objective truth and yet it seems to me in the health industry and just about any facet of life is it's so hard to actually get to the truth. And and is there really an absolute truth? Maybe with certain things, but I mean, it's such a complicated system, the body. Yeah, it's hard to know what is objectively accurate. Yeah, it's a or is it maybe it's not West, I think it's a quest, I think it's a never ending journey, which makes it more fun. You just keep unlocking and learning new layers of of what you would, the way you would frame what is true. I mean, there's like a specific way to look at certain things like a lot of people will look at, especially with health, the look at things through the lens of weight loss, which does not equal health. And no, no, and what we do is we get on the scale and think if I lost five pounds, well, I'm healthier than I was a week ago, which that's one metric, but certainly not the most accurate metric. Yeah, right. Yeah. It's or maybe not accurate, but the most significant maybe would be the better way to say it. Yes. Yeah, a lot of people don't even define health. That's one thing that I kind of blew my mind when I realized it, because I started to think about it myself. I was like, how would I define what's healthy? Because I think there's just this huge divergence in like the way that I'm thinking about things. And there are people thinking about things the same way as I am, but not very many. And then there's a lot of other people that there's just like this chaos in health, in medicine. And that chaos is a void for predators to prey on people. And maybe the chaos is designed that way, but it made me think about the definition of what is healthy. And then I realized like no one really takes the time to think about that or define it. It's very rare that you run on like what is healthy. I mean, what do you think would be healthy off top of your head? Again, I don't know if I could objectively say it, but I would say that you're specifically for a man is that you're lean, that you're strong, that your hormones are balanced properly, and that you are capable, I guess you'd say? I mean, I don't know. It's a good question. I really haven't thought about how to define health. I think we all see somebody and we assume, oh, that individual is healthy, but I don't know if we have an objective definition of it. Maybe you can enlighten me as to what you think it is. Yeah, I've got my own view about it. In my opinion, from what I've seen, and that's the only thing I can speak from, is that health for the human body is a hormonal imbalance, like you mentioned. And then no micronutrient deficiencies. And we talked about that on the last time we were recording, of just, they're the raw materials. So when I say micronutrients, I say, I'm talking about vitamins, minerals, and amino acids, and gases also would fall into that, like gas exchange stuff. But if you think about leverage curves, if you were to eliminate all your deficiencies in those things, which everyone listened to this show, all of us have deficiencies at any moment. And it's like a kind of a never-ending process to tweak and figure out and measure just this self-experimentation process. And correcting those deficiencies will bring your body back into a state of balance and bring you closer back to that state of health, where you have that vitality and the vibrance. And the hormonal balancing is almost, it's almost a natural byproduct of correcting the deficiencies. But it's also a very high leverage thing that people like to look at. And it's very helpful to look at because there's certain hormones that are indicative of a stressed state or a stressed metabolism. And then there are certain hormones that are indicative of a protective state or a healthy reproductive state. And those are, if you combine those two tenets, then I think that's a good worldview for health. And you know what's wild is that- But can I stop you right there? Because- And maybe it's just inherently built into it, but you didn't talk much about physical strength or stamina. Are you considering that as just the result of having your health by your definition in check and in order? Yeah, I mean, I think the- In order to balance your hormones, for example, you should be focusing on specific types of training and not on other types of training. And specifically- So it's almost like the next level of- Or it's like the how, of how you would achieve. It's one of the pieces of the how. So in training you mean? Yes. So with strength, it would be like a certain type of training. For example, if you're out running endurance races, it is naturally going to- Especially if it's like a heavy training load and you're actually doing it seriously, it's going to chronically elevate cortisol levels. Right. And that's just the way it is. Cortisol is a catabolic hormone. It's a stress hormone. And it will lead to less strength, less muscular strength and less muscular power and a potential breakdown of muscle tissue. And then so when you compare that to a specific way of training to use like power-based resistance training to actually intentionally elevate anabolic hormones, like testosterone growth hormone, that sort of thing, the result, the natural result of that, it ends up being you have more muscular strength and more muscular power. So that's kind of how I view it. Those are the details of how you would achieve that goal. How do you strike the balance? Because conditioning is important. And I know you can get some conditioning built into anabolic training and resistance training, but it seems to me that running isn't necessarily a bad thing. It can be if done incorrectly or not in proportion to what else you're doing. How do you begin to find that balance? I guess it depends on what your goal is, right? Like, if it's sport-specific conditioning and a lot of sports is really relevant. And sure, right. But it's a different goal than being home only balanced. So you're like kind of take boxing, for example, you can't go a full boxing match against an opponent without being highly conditioned, preferably more conditioned than the other guy, right? Because that's one of the most in wrestling and MMA. Like those are the most brutal sports for that sort of thing. And at the same time, you have to be powerful, you have to be strong. The issue is that it doesn't necessarily mean that their hormones are going to be balanced, especially because it's such a period. There's a lot of periodization involved in the training. And there's like these potentially seasons or periods where people are training up to one competition or a series of competitions and then taking an off season. It doesn't necessarily mean that they're going to have as high of testosterone as they would want or as high of growth hormone or as low of cortisol. It's going to be a balance to strike to try and beat that one opponent. And hopefully you're better than he is at that moment. Right. Yeah. I mean, I think about the majority of guys listening to this aren't going to, they're not competitive boxers or they aren't running 20 marathons in a year or whatever it is. But what I think most guys here are dealing with is that they want to have enough energy at work and they want to have enough stamina when it comes to the bedroom. And they want to be able to defend themselves in a 60 second to a hundred and twenty second altercation. And so I think that requires a different level of training or a different type of training, more practical maybe than focusing on one specific event against one specific opponent for a very short period of time. Yeah. And so what I would say for somebody listening, so like for a guy, if you're looking to find that balance in your own body, first off, measuring always helps. So if you take blood tests, I know that's also not, it's realistic for some, it's more realistic for some people than it is for others, specifically financially. So the end time wise, it takes some time and takes some level of expertise to even read tests sometimes. So for most guys, I would pay attention to actually some indicators on your body and in your energy levels and that sort of thing, sleep habits and so forth. So what I'm talking about is physique wise, there's some interesting things. So naturally, your body is naturally going to have more capacity to store body fat in your, for most guys in the belly area. And that's also that fat specifically is great for estrogen storage. And also the more estrogen that's in your body typically it'll tend to be stored in certain areas, specifically there and in the pec region for a lot of guys. So that's where a lot of guys will have like gynecomasti issues. Sure. And so if you're dealing with those sorts of issues that's potentially indicative of higher than you would like estrogen levels and cortisol levels. So that's one thing. So like if you're training a specific way and you're not necessarily happy with certain like stubborn fat that's kind of clinging on. And especially if like I hear a lot of stories of guys that they're like, hey, I've got this stubborn fat around my belly or whatever or on my pecs that I'm like doing everything that I can in terms of diet and they're trying to eat everything correctly and they're not overeating and so forth. Which would if that's true, that would be indicative of more of like, let's look at your training as well and see what you're doing. And if they're like out running five miles a day or whatever, I would recommend that they switch to something like sprinting instead of that and sprint twice a week, not every day and see what happens in terms of the difference. And it's interesting. Coming back to the idea of like the capacity for certain tissue to store hormones or have more receptors for hormones than other tissue. Because and I talked about it in my book, The Enthor. So it's like a resistance training specifically for anabolic optimization and hormone. And so I talked about something that's it's just an observation. I have no like kind of evolutionary anthropological evidence for this, but it's really strange that or it's cool that you actually have guys have more androgen receptors. So things that would bind testosterone, for example, in certain muscle tissues and others. And those are specifically their high amounts, obviously in your legs. And you hear that quite a bit, especially on bodybuilding websites. But there's actually a high amount of androgen receptors in your traps, your shoulders, your upper chest, and your upper back. And the cool thing about those receptors, those receptor sites is that you can actually increase the amount of androgen receptor sites in that muscle tissue in your upper body. And that's really interesting. You can't, from what I've read in the research, you can't increase the amount of receptor sites in your legs, even though your legs do have the muscle in your legs have a lot of receptor sites naturally. But you can increase the amounts in the upper body. And so if you look at the idea of like a powerful masculine physique and just kind of picture that in your mind, what's kind of the most yoked hench dude that you've ever seen? What's that kind of guy? There's that picture of that one dude who's got this big beard and some massive trap. He's got an axe over his shoulder or something and rip it. There's some picture like that. I've seen a million times on the internet. And a picture or something like that, that's a really masculine look. But if you look at hormone distribution and receptor site distribution, that dude has actually has maximized, and I don't know if he's on some sort of juice or not, but he's maximized the amount of receptor sites available to bind more circulating testosterone in that upper body tissue. So he's got is this just outside of resistance training those areas or is that what's actually building up these androgen receptors? Yeah, training those areas will build it up. It's one of those positive feedback loops. Yeah. So it's pretty cool because if you start to picture it, it's like, yeah, the guy like that has like no belly fat, right? It's very low estrogen and low cortisol potentially too. But those areas, the trap shoulders, everything are big. They're not unnaturally big. It looks naturally big, like the right size, the proportion. Right. It looks like it should. Yeah. And you can tell when certain people, a lot of guys are using some sort of drugs because it's actually like a reiteration of the truth of what I'm saying right now about those areas is that if someone hops on the juice, those areas are the ones that blow up the fastest because there's more receptor sites available. And if you're training correctly, they're going to increase the amount of receptor sites. I'm just trying to wrap my head around this. So we'll, because you talk about this feedback loop, so testosterone will in those specific areas, I know it does generally in the body, but in those specific areas will then enhance your capacity to build muscle in those areas. So if yes, if you're training those areas, they're going to have a higher amount of androgen receptors available. And if your testosterone levels are either adequate or increasing, they're going to have more area, the testosterone molecule will have more sites to bind to. And so the androgen receptor, that is the binding factor. That's what actually binds the testosterone or that molecule. It's kind of like a locking key type of deal. Interesting. Okay. Yeah, I didn't know this. And then so when that molecules bound though on those receptor sites, it initiates a cascade of events, chemical events essentially. So it's going to trigger more muscle growth in that area. What are some of the chemical reactions going on in that process then? Basically a lot of protein synthesis, anything involved in tissue building. So like, and that's what they mean by anabolic in terms of growth. Yeah, it's I don't know if we need to get into like all the super details, but. Yeah, well, I mean, we don't need to get super specific because you've written this book, Master Your Tea, which it goes into depth on all of this stuff. But I am very curious about the process of how this actually works. Yeah, I mean, as far as I know, it's like just any sort of growth cascade. Yeah. So how did you get into this? Because your background is is basically neuroscience, which you really wouldn't necessarily make that connection, but you've got this medical training that's given you a huge advantage when it comes to how all this stuff works. Yeah, I mean, so based on my like my personal story was when I was 19, I was diagnosed with a tumor in my pituitary gland in the brain and the pituitary controls your hormones. So like the secretion, kind of the conversation of the hormones from the brain to the body, so gonads and adrenal glands, so forth. So I studied neuroscience to try and figure out and solve my own problem naturally. And that was the impetus, but it was in the context of hormones. And as a young guy, my I mean, my testosterone was 11 nanograms per deciliter at that time. I don't give us a frame of reference. I don't know. It's pretty much I don't know the benchmarks. Okay. Yeah, it's pretty much zero. There was like pretty much no production. And so the what the lab reference ranges would consider to be normal, like a normal reference range is they'll say like somewhere around 400 to 1000. I think 400 is pretty low. Yeah, but that's that seems like that's what I've heard. Like it seems like you should be up if I understand the numbers correctly up in the 800s or so. Does that sound right? Yeah, 800 is very healthy. 800 to 1000s. Very good. Okay. Yeah. And then but anywhere like above 650 that that kind of turns into like you're in a decent zone. You can get it higher, obviously, I've seen people at 1500 naturally. That's pretty cool. But the highest I got was 1192, generally just stick in the 800 to 1100. And also fluctuates quite a bit. I would love to do like a testing protocol and be able to measure it over a period of 12 weeks, like a couple times a day. You know, that would be awesome. But financial will it change that much in that period of time? Just like a couple of times a day? It could swing potentially 100 points here and there. Yeah. I mean, the interesting so yeah, in the morning, your cortisol is going to be higher than it is at night. And that can impact it because cortisol is it acts antithetically to testosterone, not in a perfect one to one, but like it's suppressed. The higher cortisol is the lower your testosterone can be. You were going to use the word suppress. Is that actually what's happening is that when there's cortisol creation, it doesn't have that the body doesn't have the ability then to create testosterone? What I think there is is it's like a hierarchical thing. The cortisol is indicative of like more of a survival state, less or less of a reproductive state. And that's kind of how I think that it works. At the most basic like kind of laymen way of thinking about, I guess, which is good for me. That's what I need. That's the lame explanation to. Well, it's funny because you've got all the training and everything else. And I think that's actually it's good. It's good. You have all this training and you have all this knowledge behind it. But you know, for for us, regular guys, it's like, how do you bridge that gap between all of the medical training and terminology and everything that's going on in the background? And then just knowing what you need to know to apply it and make it work in your life. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, because really what I mean, when it comes down to it, a lot of this stuff is very simple. It's it's easy for people to get caught up in like all this complicated stuff involved with it. You know, all these these processes and a lot for a lot of people, it's fun to figure out. It's like this puzzle to figure out. But for for most people, I think understanding the simplicity behind it in terms of action is what's most important. And things that they can do, things they shouldn't do, you know, if they want to achieve this certain goal. And it's probably true of anything like what's that there's a Da Vinci quote, I think about like simplicity being the ultimate. Yeah. Sure. Sure. Yeah. So that's so well, let's break that down. Let's talk about some of the shoulds and shouldn'ts because I think that'd be useful for the guys listening. What are some things that? Well, let's do the shouldn'ts first, some things that maybe you should avoid when it comes to building up levels of testosterone and in turn building up muscle and all the other benefits that come from it. Yeah. So in the Master of T book, I have this pyramid. I think we could use that as a reference here. It's a pyramid based on the base of the pyramid is the foundation. And it's the most important part. And then you work your way up to the top of the pyramid. And it's an easy way to classify things and a metaphor to think about essentially in terms of what you should focus on with the most leverage versus the least leverage. They're all important to form the actual shape. But we could start just, we already mentioned a lot about like the micronutrients. The book goes into a lot of detail about pretty much all the important ones. And the idea of being deficient in a micronutrient is it's a matter of your body doesn't have the raw material it needs to actually fulfill certain processes with it, whether it's like on the cellular level, or the vitamin working as a cofactor and some enzyme cascade, or the mineral that's needed for for some hormonal triggering like like zinc, for example, very common deficiency in guys, but also very essential for the production of testosterone. So if you're deficient in zinc, it's going to be very difficult to have a normal or high testosterone level, the same thing with magnesium. And just fixing a lot of these deficiencies is research showing that if the hormonal problem is caused by a specific deficiency, fixing the deficiency will naturally correct that hormonal problem. So there's probably a large cohort of guys out there with low testosterone or lower testosterone that is caused by a simple deficiency or a handful of simple ones that they can fix pretty easily. And this makes sense because a lot of times what you'll hear is, well, just lift more or something. And it's like, okay, well, if you don't have these fundamental building blocks in place, then your lifting isn't going to be as well a work probably, but it won't be to your phrase earlier is won't be as leveraged as if you had these micronutrients in place. When you won't really have a clear understanding of what the problem is, it's just a band-aid. Yeah, a lot of people can have like you could have the same symptom. You, me, 10 other guys have the same symptom, all caused by different things. And so by prescribing the same, you know, do this one task to like lift more weight, something that's not actually trying to figure out what the cause was, then it's not necessarily going to serve everyone. Maybe two people out of the group are like, oh, yeah, okay, it just wasn't lifting heavy. But for the most part, it's going to be caused by these basic things. And that's why, in the beginning of the conversation, talking about the definition of health is super important because nothing matters without a reference point. So that being the barometer, basically, against which we're going to measure things, that's the natural place to start, looking for the deficiencies that are potentially causing the issue. Now, if you're not deficient in anything, which is highly unlikely, but you still have a persistent low testosterone problem, then you move on to other things and to try and deduce what was going on. Yeah. Before we get into those, if I remember correctly from our last conversation, you said that there was a resource or a company that you were using to test your micronutrient levels. If I remember correctly, does that sound right? Yeah. So that one's called reset yourself. And they just send you a kit. That's an in-home kit, right? Yeah, it's easy. It's like a mail order kit, and they just shoot it to you in the mail. It's got instructions and a little booklet, and you cut a piece of scalp hair or a few pieces and a little chunk or hair close to your scalp and send it back to them. And a couple weeks later, they hit you up. There's a test results you log into the dashboard, and they show you just in a very easy graphic way what you're deficient in or what you have in excess, and it's also possible to have excess. Is how often are you doing that? I'm trying to do that quarterly. I got to send my next one in. But yeah. Do you find for yourself that you are perpetually deficient and in certain minerals? Like for example, is the body just like my body, for example, could it just naturally be low in zinc just all the time? And so that's something you have to be constantly aware of? Or is this something once you kind of level it out, it should maintain itself pretty well? Yeah, there's a good question. The certain ones are more, you can become more easily deficient in them, and those are the electrolytes. So magnesium, potassium, sodium, and calcium. Would this have anything to do with like dehydration or cramping? Yeah, that's interesting because that's actually one thing that I experience quite a bit, specifically when I'm running. Yeah, you're electrolyte. You probably have, I mean, usually cramping is tied to potassium, but they're, I mean, they fluctuate so much because they're heavily used in the body. And then it can come down to just like your daily consumption of those minerals. Sure. That one can fluctuate quite a bit. And there's patterns actually, it's interesting of like different, I think I mentioned this last time we were talking of like sympathetic dominance pattern where you have a high calcium level and low magnesium, sodium, and potassium. And it tends to kind of form this downward curve, if you had the potassium in the front. And it's indicative of high adrenaline and high cortisol levels. And it's interesting because like when hormones exhibit a certain pattern or neurotransmitter, it'll, it'll use up these electrolytes in different ways. I think, you know, down to that compensatory concept of like, oh my, I'm in a very stressed state right now. I'm using these to compensate for it. Like I need to use more of this or more of that more sodium, more potassium, more magnesium to try and reach homeostasis because the body's always going to fight back toward it. It's not always successful, especially because our minds are typically much better at keeping our body away from it than we probably should be. Also, just because a lot of people just don't know, and it's hard to know all the time what you're doing, but what I mean, that is kind of- Or the impact of it. Yeah, or the impact. Yeah, like, I mean, a lot of people don't know that it's not healthy to, to like be doing marathons, how do you, how do you keep yourself out of these stressful levels? Because I mean, it's just natural. It's inevitable you're going to be stressed out at work, you're going to have a relationship, a conversation in your relationship with your kids or your wife, you're going to be working out or running or any number of things that I would probably assume that, that they're healthy levels of stress and actually good for the body. Yeah, it's, so the concept of hormesis, like U-stress, there's certain things that are helpful in terms of stress in rebuilding, but the rebuilding aspect is the key. When you're talking about rebuilding, you're talking about recuperation recovery from these events, is that right? Yeah, or something else entirely. Well, like, for example, I guess on the physical level, a U-stress would be training. And like, physical training, say you're hitting the weights, right? You need to be able to recover from that, obviously. So after training, your body's naturally going to trigger a response by recruiting more anabolic hormone production and so forth to try and rebuild that muscle tissue so that you can be stronger the next time you hit the gym. And that's just evidenced by the fact that we do get stronger, we do build muscle in certain training situations, the most training situations. The psychological idea, I think, comes down to a worldview thing. You get into a fight with your significant other, you have problems at work, that sort of thing. The psychology of it's probably the most important thing, like the way you see it, because that'll dictate whether somebody takes it down one road or the other. Right, the response, sure. Yeah, like, they could say, oh, whoa, it's me. I'm like, everyone's out to get me on this victim. And that's one way to do it. The other way is to take it in stride and say, I'm going to make this a U-stress. Yeah, I got in a fight because I was being an asshole. And what can I learn from it? What can I learn from it? Yes. And so it's more of a productive way of thinking about it. So it's both, you could have the same exact response and two different people respond, or the same exact conflict in two people respond differently to it. And that comes down to choice. And that choice is typically based on the way they see the world. So that, yeah, I love thinking about that kind of thing. And that's like a huge element to this, is mindset for sure, outside of the biological stuff. Well, and it is biological, right? I mean, it's just a series of synapses in the brain. So it's all biological anyways, even if it is just mindset. There's a biological basis of all behavior, yeah. Well, what would be the other you say to basis? What else would come into play then? Well, that's a big conversation because it's still something like, you just get down to consciousness. When I say biological basis, I mean, like exactly what you're saying. There's a, there is a measurable, either origin in terms of like electricity and chemicals to any behavior, or something that can be proven. I mean, essentially, if I'm understanding correctly, we're talking about science and perhaps even the spirituality. Yeah, yeah, or the idea of consciousness too, if we get down to that level, because the, the, the measureability of a lot of, of this stuff is a bit overblown, I think, at least from what I've seen in being like at a research institution. There's a lot of stuff we don't know. In a lot of the ways that we measure the body are based on just like oxygen usage or certain gas usage or blood flow, that sort of thing. And they're like, Oh, lit up over here, lit up over there. That correlates to this for this. But that's not exactly accurate information. It doesn't tell you exactly everything you need to know. Is too, is it too simplified? Is that what you're suggesting? Yeah, yeah, we don't know enough yet about a lot of this stuff. I mean, a lot of people are making measure or making a lot of headway into it, but it's, it's hard to say to pinpoint like, Oh, this response was caused by this chemical fired here or there, you know, I don't think it's that simple. They may be correlated, but they aren't necessarily causing one, one thing to happen. Yeah. And that's why the, I took a really interesting class call. It was a, an AI class on like AI theory. And so they're trying to, there's a lot of cool stuff in AI, because obviously they're trying to recreate people and neural networks, just the decision making and the, and mixing consciousness too. Consciousness was the main topic in the whole thing, because that is what they call the hard problem. And it's the, like that missing piece that a lot of people have theories on it, but it's kind of this, like there's a void between our understanding and whatever that is. So it's, it's pretty cool. Oh, gents, let me hit the pause button here real quick and introduce you to a resource that has, frankly, it's proven to be one of the greatest tools that men have incorporated in their lives to improve their health, relationships, business bank accounts. It's called the Iron Council, and it's a powerful tribe of 500 men all working together and holding each other accountable to audacious goals and powerful actions that frankly have transformed their lives. And the truth is, you could go out of the loan, but those men who find other men to bandwidth go further. They slip less. And it seems to me they accomplish more than those who don't. I know that's certainly been true in my life. So if you're ready to be pushed and challenged and held accountable and accomplish more than maybe you ever have in your entire life, then I would encourage you to tap into this powerful resource, the brotherhood that is called the Iron Council. Go to orderofman.com slash Iron Council. You can learn a little bit more about what we're doing and ultimately lock in your spot. Again, that's orderofman.com slash Iron Council. Do that after the show, guys. For now, we'll finish up the conversation with Christopher. That is, it's fascinating stuff to me. I mean, it really is. And I can definitely see what they would call it a hard problem. That is the understatement of the year right there. I've got so much to talk about. I kind of went off on a tangent here. So we were talking about the shuds and the shuds and you were talking about the micronutrients and getting that right. And then you said, okay, from there, we'd move on to what would be the next step or the next consideration? Yeah, the next step in the pyramid is the nutrition. So lots of interesting stuff in nutrition. The easiest way to think about nutrition is first off, are you eating the types of foods that are easy to digest compatible with your gut? And which means basically you can absorb the nutrients in them. And the micronutrients that are in that that's in that food is what you need. Right. And you'll get a lot of clarity after that first step of the micronutrient step, especially if someone measures it. And then the the nutrition aspect though, there's a lot, a lot to it. And some of it's a bit counterintuitive. In terms of, we could just kind of go down. So carbs, fats and proteins, like the simplest way to think about stuff, the macronutrients. So there was an interesting study that was specifically with like, it was in like semi trained individuals. So probably most guys that are listening to this, right, go to the gym a couple times a week. And it would measured testosterone output, testosterone production and testosterone levels, serum testosterone levels, based on certain macronutrient profiles that these groups were eating. And they were trying different ratios and that sort of thing. It was pretty telling. So protein based on that study was the least important. Really? That's like, like you said, counterintuitive. Yeah. Yeah. It was it was the one where the high, the guys that were on the high protein diet at the sacrifice of, and obviously they were controlling caloric intake too. Right. So it's like, yeah, that's the other measurement is if, you know, let's say they were all, I don't remember the exact calorie number, but let's just say they were all somewhere in like mid 2000s, probably 2500. That's usually kind of the per day, you're saying calories per day per day. Yeah, usually like a range, kind of where they put things. So say they were all eating the same amount of calories, but the guys who were on the, on the high protein diet, at the, at the expense of, because any of these, these macro nutrients have calories in them. They at the expense of the other ones, they actually had the lowest testosterone levels. So like the expense of fats and carbs. So they were replacing fats and carbs with proteins that would have an impact on testosterone. Yes. Okay. So they're at these high protein levels. What would you say as far as like a ratio would be? What would that ratio be? In the high protein ratio? Yeah. I think for most guys, that's kind of like, if you have protein over 55 up 60% of the diet, then you would consider that high. Yep. Okay. And that's pretty high. That's where for like average size guys going up into that range and above, you're getting like 220 grams of protein a day and above. So then the other findings were cool too. They found that the ratios with carbs and fats indicated, and it kind of debunks the whole idea that you see on both sides of like, oh, carbs are better for testosterone or, oh, fats are better for testosterone. They had similar results on both groups. So people that did higher fat, people that did higher carb, similar results. And the, but really what it indicated to everyone was that it, the carbs and the fats are the most important thing. And what they did is they went back and you have to have a, obviously, a baseline level of protein to support the level of training and recovery that you needed. Right. You can't have no protein. Yeah. Yeah. But you can have a lot less than you think. So it's pretty cool, especially if you're maximizing your anabolic hormones at the same time. Well, I've seen some of these guys. There's a guy I follow on Instagram. I can't remember his name right offhand. He's a vegetarian and the guy's jacked. Like he's a big dude. So he's, I mean, I'm sure he's replacing protein with something else, but I can't imagine it's somebody that's on like the carnivore diet. Yeah. Yeah. That they're definitely different in the levels of protein. And, and, yeah, I don't know. I don't know what to think about a lot of the vegetarian, like a lot of these Instagram guys, I don't know what to think about them. Well, and it's hard, you know, you can see something on the outside and a story can be told that can't be verified. And there's a lot of other little moving parts that you're not really familiar with. Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying we need to take that as doctrine necessarily, but it's just an interesting perspective, I guess. Yeah. There's actually a lot of people thinking this way now with moving back toward lower protein intakes. And I think a lot of the protein dogma that's been around the last 20 years has been mostly just like really good marketing from supplement companies. Yeah. So yeah, I mean, everything's marketing for sure. Yeah. And well, with the fats though, it's pretty interesting. So in this study, like let me down a freaking rabbit hole for the next eight years, since I read it. And with regard to the fats, because what they did is they broke down the fats and they looked at different types of fatty acid makeup. And they measured that against testosterone levels. So saturated fats were the best for supporting testosterone levels. And mono and saturated fats came in second. And mono and saturated would be something that you get from olives or avocados. Okay. Poly and saturated fats were the worst. And poly and saturated fats are basically very weak bonds. And they're easily denatured, easily can go rancid with light and heat. And so it's, you know, it makes sense. Like, if you have a rancid oil in your body or rancid substance of some kind in your body, that it would negatively affect your hormones. I think you were talking about this with even like deep frying things. If I remember right, when we had talked initially that that actually causes these, what are poly and saturated fats to break down and go rancid like you were saying? Yes. Yeah. And that's kind of the shame is that most people use these types of oils for frying, or just use in restaurants for cooking. It's like vegetable oil, right? Yeah, vegetable oil. So it's interesting because it's called vegetable oils too. And then the it's not even like they're made mostly most of them are from seeds, which is I don't know why they call it vegetable oils. I was looking up kind of the whole story behind all that. And it's probably marketing like you're saying earlier. Yeah, I think it's more it's a lot of propaganda. Yeah. That story is wild. It's basically just a quick aside of like why these oils are in our food supply right now is the in the early 1900s, there was excess of cotton seed oil. And it was used in industrial use for paint mostly. Okay. And there was an excess of it. And there's there've always been and there were especially at this time a lot of these groups like the coalition for this or the aluminum group, you know, what was that Alco or whatever like got fluoride in our water water supply. There was all these groups back then and they're I'm sure they're still around. But there is likely a group that facilitated this is like we have an excess of this industrial material. We need to find something to do with it. Make sense, right? So there were three companies specifically that started to introduce this type of oil into food products. It was JM Smucker, Wesson and Procter & Gamble. And this was like early 1900s. And they they basically started marketing as a butter replacement or a tallow or a large replacement sort of thing. And using and that's you know, margarine came around the wesson cooking oils, Crisco, all that stuff came out of this. And they're basically these these easily rancidized fats that especially with heat that you should never you should never consume because they they not only damage your reproductive hormone functioning but they also damage your thyroid. And that's where I started the more I started reading about these types of fatty acids I was like, Dan, this stuff is bad. And the thyroid is that is that responsible for regulating these hormones as well? It plays a part in the whole system. Yes. But it's it's a chiefly responsible for metabolism. And the thyroid hormones help regulate your metabolism. Okay. So the now what gets really interesting is the what happened after that there was a guy that had a lab is George Burr. And he came up with he had this theory about I think it was like a purely scientific theory before it was a bit compromised about essential fatty acid deficiency. And he had this he was doing experiments in his lab about trying to prove that it seems like it was more from what I've read it was more trying to prove instead of disprove that this was real. And the the guys well actually he'd been running some experiments on rats. And you notice that they were like, uh, respurating a lot. So there was a lot of escape from oxygen of escape of oxygen from the body of these rats when he when he was he made these like very carefully devised diets that were higher in sugar had zero fatty acids in them. So there's no no fat at all, especially none of these types of polyinsaturated fats. And they were mostly just eating different types of sugar, including lactose is one of the sugars. So it was like it was like a mixture of of sucrose, fructose, glucose, lactose, and something else and galactose maybe. And what he found was like they were actually just, uh, um, there's a lot of oxygen being produced by these rats. And, um, he thought that was potentially that that was a bad thing. It actually happened to be a good thing because the the respiratory quotient is which was what they were measuring is a indicator of a healthy thyroid and a high metabolism, which I guess he didn't know that which is what how much the body, how much oxygen the body is consuming or or. Yeah, let me let me look it up. I was just looking up the actual like direct definition of this. Yeah. The, uh, yeah, the respiratory quotient. So there there is this like you want to shoot for apparently you want to shoot for like a 1.0. So, um, let's see, respiratory quotient. Okay, here's one thing. I'm like, so I think it's basically just the amount of oxygen that you're using. So what, but one thing that like what he found with it, right? Was the, uh, the one of the guys in his lab, one of the research assistants or whatever, or grad students or whoever it was, he actually detried it on himself. So it was a human trial. And it was, it was interesting. He had this like really good experience having no, no fatty acids. Um, he went through a six month trial. His body weight went from 152 pounds down to, um, 138 pounds where his metabolic rate was measured at both instances at the beginning of the end. And it was at the beginning, it was 12% below normal. And at the end, it was just 2% below normal. So it went up almost completely normalized. Uh, he ate 250, uh, 2, uh, 2,500 calories per day, mostly from these sugars. And, um, that was like his body weight went down metabolism normalized. And you wouldn't think that for, especially for that weight of a guy, that 2,500 calories per day of sugar. Um, that's interesting. And he had these psychological effects too. Like he said that he had massive energy throughout the workdays, like he used to fall, you kind of be done at the end of the day, or like in the afternoon, kind of that slump that everyone has. And he said that his fatigue completely disappeared on the diet. His migraines went away in like two weeks or three weeks. And he had mild, he had my, no, six weeks. His migraines, uh, he'd have migraines since he was a kid. And is with the respiratory quotient, it basically, uh, was above, it stayed above 1.0 and it has highest 1.1 forward in month six. Uh, whereas a type two diabetic has a respiratory quotient in the point seven range. Oh, wow. Yeah. So, so what kind of foods was he eating that? I mean, that's because you talk about these, these sugars, but what specifically kind of foods are we talking about here? Um, I think a lot of what they were doing was using juices, um, and like mixtures of the, of the starch and the, and the sugars into like a liquid. So basically what, what I'm understanding or what I'm hearing is that the, the, the proteins aren't as significant as maybe as we once thought. Yeah. The proteins aren't, the fats definitely aren't in terms of unsaturated fats. Um, and, and that a, in that a high sugar diet is not necessarily, um, as bad as people would think. And, um, it says, actually it says here he was also taking baking soda. So, uh, mineral oil, salt, vitamin D three, vitamin A and iron along with. So he was getting a lot of these micronutrients then that you're, you're referring to as well. Interesting. Yep. Yep. And then the rest of it was just from like, I guess liquid, mixtures of glucose, fructose, lactose, sucrose and potato starch. Interesting. So we're, so all right. So we've got, we've covered micronutrients, um, nutrition. So these are more of your macros than, than, than what else is into consideration. Yep. So, uh, yeah, sorry, I went off on a little tangent. I just thought that was an interesting story. The, um, because that, that got picked up by the, the propaganda machine of the 1900s in terms of the essential fatty acid deficiency thing. But yeah. So, so, uh, next up the, um, my opinion about carbohydrates from what I've seen are that you want, um, like fructose is very protective and, uh, fructose is very good for thyroid, getting fruit in its natural form from, from fruits, like a, a real fruit and just eat it. It's got the natural amount of fiber that you're going to want in it. And, uh, it will, uh, it will also be very easy to digest and it has a lot of prebiotic fibers. Right. So you want to eat a banana, not like banana pudding. Yeah. Yeah. Gotcha. Banana cream pie. That's right, which is delicious. Yeah. You could, you could say that, say, well, I got my, my fruits for the day, right? Yeah. I mean, eating, eating fruits is awesome. They're, they're, there are a lot of nutrients in the fruits and they're very easy to, easy to digest. Um, uh, starches that, that don't contain, uh, mineral keylators, like, um, uh, like potatoes and squash, uh, sweet potatoes, white rice. Um, those are preferable, especially people that are training. Um, and yeah, it's just, it's a very simple way of eating. Uh, and it maximizes mineral vitamin and mineral absorption and minimizes any chelation and the idea of like binding, prematurely binding those minerals because they're all charged and they need to be in the ionic form to be able to be absorbed by the, the intestine and, uh, certain mineral keylators, like you'd find in, um, grains, uh, beans, nuts, seeds, uh, they contain these things that will potentially bind those minerals that you want from you and they will keep it from being absorbed. So those will just pass, those just pass through you then. Is that what you're saying? Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Interesting. Yep. Yeah. This makes sense that there, there's so many little moving parts here, but it makes sense when you, when you address it this way and really the simplicity of it. Cool. Yeah. Good. Yeah. I'm just trying to, like, figure out a system, the framework to think within for people. Well, I think the biggest framework is, is moving from the scientific names to, okay, what food should people actually be consuming? Mm hmm. Like that, that's what somebody like myself or, you know, the average person listening would, would probably say, okay, I, I got that. But like, what food should I be eating that contain these things? Yeah. I mean, the, so, uh, like the simplest way to think about it is a friend of mine put it this way when I was explaining it to him and he's like the big world's biggest skeptic and, uh, he loves being a skeptic. And, uh, I was explaining this, the whole philosophy to him. And, um, he ended up getting super into it, which was a really good sign. And the way that he explained it was fruits and roots for the, the main carb source. Um, so they're not, it's, it's not necessarily vegetables. It's the roots. So they're, you know, the, it's tubers. It's potatoes, sweet potatoes, uh, radishes, carrots, that sort of thing. Onions. Yeah, because last time we were talking, you had talked about the, the, like you shouldn't be consuming the leafs. Is that right? Yeah. I think basically what I say is that there's unnecessary and there, it's something you shouldn't consume in high quality, high quantities, uh, because especially raw, which most people consume leaves raw, uh, because there's just indicated, like they contain things that are called goitrogens that, um, that will block iodine uptake in your thyroid gland. And a lot of people just don't realize that. I mean, it's, it's one of those just things that we've heard forever since we look kids eat your salad or eat your broccoli or whatever, um, that it's not necessary, it's not necessary to be healthy to eat these things. And especially if you eat them in high quantities, which some people do, um, it might be something that you want to reconsider and, uh, opt for something that's not going to be blocking that iodine uptake or have these kind of these, like natural responses. If you think about the evolutionary logic of, um, eating plants, certain plants, uh, the, the roots themselves are going to naturally have, they're going to contain a lot of the, the nutrients that the plant needs to grow healthy. Well, I mean, that's where it's, it's consuming it from the dirt. So like that's the closest access or source to the nutrient. Exactly. Yeah. It's good. And especially if you're growing your plants in great dirt, you know, you got rich soil, then you're going to get a ton of these minerals in the plant. And then they're stored in the roots and they basically come up through the stock usually due to the leaves or the, the energy producers of the plant, right? So, um, they need to protect themselves. They need to evolve to protect themselves against predators. And, uh, against like the long term consumption of that plant, because it, you know, say if people got like super into eating a plant and they had no real sustainable way of growing it, they would eat it out of existence or, or same with animals. You can, you can hunt things out of existence. And, uh, it makes sense that the, the plants would naturally evolve these, these mechanisms to defend against long term consumption or making it like a habit to consume for generations of, of, you know, one thing just for the own survival. Right. Which then you're consuming that? Yeah. Well, and then if, if you look at fruits, for example, too, so fruits have to be in order to spread the fruit of a plant is what contains the seeds, sure. And in order for that plant to continue, the fruit needs to either be eaten and the seeds, the seeds can't be digested so they get shat out basically, right? And that goes somewhere in the ground, right? And then the, especially if you're looking at like not, not having a sewage system or something, but it's actually just literally going on the ground. And, uh, the other alternative for the, for the fruit is to just rot and fall on the tree. Right. And then it'll be on the ground again. So, and then maybe a bird picks it up or does something, it just, you know, they spread the, the nature of the fruit is that it needs to be eaten or it rots and the seeds needs, the seed needs to spread somewhere. So that makes total sense that it would be so easy to digest. It would be so healthy and rich in minerals for the animals that are consuming it. So we've talked a lot about a lot. We've talked about micronutrients, macronutrients. We've talked about training. Is there any other considerations that we ought to, we ought to consider as we try to boost our testosterone levels and balance ourselves out, hormone only? Yeah, there's a, there are a lot of lifestyle factors, which I think are, they're fun to think about, fun to talk about. Things like sleep, sex, meditation, even being in nature. Like, these are things I call activators. I like to classify things as like a activator or a blocker. Okay. And a lot of these lifestyle elements, I mean, the activator blocker thing can also be training and food and so forth. But with the lifestyle elements, it's, it's a good way to think about it. Is like, is this habit that I have, or is this thing that I'm doing, is this actively bringing me closer to my goal, or is it bringing me farther away from my goal? So the sleep, for example, that's pretty obvious one. That's, that's a big one for a lot of people, right? Yeah, I mean, I think most people are just are, are under sleeping. Yeah. And even when they are sleeping, it's not, it's not great sleep. Yeah. And there are ways to fix that, that you don't need to use a lot of these drugs that people are going toward for it. And you can get just work with your body and naturally get toward that state where you fall asleep quickly and you stay asleep all night. One of the most effective things that I've found for this is glycine. And it's a, it's an amino acid and it's considered a protective amino acid. It's an anti stress amino acid. So it's going to help to rebalance your, your hormones and rebalance and especially like put you to sleep. It's kind of a relaxant type of thing if you consume it in high enough quantities. Do you, do you take this in in like a pill form or you can take it in a pill form or, but to get the amount that you would want for sleep, the powder will be best. We actually made a supplement for umzu called total sleep. And it's, it's got a ton of glycine. I think it's like three grams per little scoop. And I take two scoops of that every night. It tastes like a, like a little lemon tea. We got some lemon balm in there as well and some magnesium. And yeah, I mean, just puts you out, but you don't have a sleep hangover in the morning either. You feel better. You feel great. And glycine is actually a key element of growth hormone secretion, especially at night. There was a study that was really cool. It found that there was, they did a mixture of, of glycine, glutamine and niacin. And it basically increased growth hormone production in the subjects by 70%. Which is definitely, that's almost doubling. Yeah. Yeah. So I love recommending glycine because I think it's, it's like underrated. Most people don't, haven't heard about it, but you got to take it in the right quantity and, and it can work wonders. Yeah, I think that's a good, that's a good place to, to really focus again, because I think it's something that a lot of people don't focus on. Although, I think we inherently all know this, or at least moving towards knowing some of these things, right? Like, because I think the common thought is, well, I'll just sleep when I'm dead. I got things to do, so I can't sleep versus, hey, this is actually part of the recovery process and something that will actually help you perform better as a man. Yeah, I mean, it's, it's a crucial aspect. If you get a good night's sleep, you can kind of do whatever you want. Like you can do that whole, I found that the better I sleep, I get more of that zone of like the idea of time collapsing or like controlling my time throughout the day, so I'm less reactive. I feel more in tune with just the, my daily actions and, and I don't really react to a lot of what people are doing. But if I'm, if I'm like deprived of sleep and I'm a bit on edge, then it's a lot easier to just react to people. And there's plenty of studies also showing like large drops in testosterone levels. There was one where if people had as little, I can't remember the exact hours, I think it was like two hour deprivation over a course of a certain period of time, it cut their testosterone levels in half. So it doesn't take much of a continued drop in the sleep quality. And that's why sleep, I think, is one of these high leverage things. I think it's, it's something if you have low T, you want to pick probably a few things that you can handle that you think you want to focus on that are high leverage, maybe one in each category. Like, all right, I, even without measuring, like maybe I'm deficient in this thing or that thing. I'm looking at some, because you can find that stuff online. And in the book too, we talked about like signs of these deficiencies and submit you, I pick that thing. You might say, okay, I'm, I'm eating a lot of polyinsaturated fats. I should probably just try, let me just cut them out of my diet for a month, see how I feel. Next up, I'm going to pick a lifestyle factor. I'm going to focus on my sleep. And I'm going to work on getting a full, you know, eight hours of sleep per night. Maybe you're only getting four and a half or five or six, try and try and get eight. And then focusing on, you know, I'm going to try, one, like I'm going to try a supplement that's been proven in a ton of studies to increase my testosterone. So you might try using something like ashwagandha and use that for a month. I think that's a good way to think about it probably for a lot of guys listening is just like, pick one thing in each area and do these self experiments for a month, start to figure out what's going to work for you. And then it's a, it's a manageable thing too, because you might see, see the book and see it's like you have 500 pages, right? It's like a medical reference. You're like, I don't know if I'm going to go through this whole thing. Yeah, it's more of a reference book, and it should be that way. And, but it could be overwhelming if you're like, damn, I got to do all this stuff. Yeah. Yeah. So maybe it's a good way to think about it, just like pick these things and sleep for sure is a massive leverage thing. Because of that stuff, like, if you're sleeping really well, and that sleep cycle app is really great to measure the quality, because it kind of gamifies it. Have you ever used that app? No, sleep cycle is what it's called sleep cycle. Yeah, it's pretty cool app. You just kind of set the phone, you got to plug it in, you just kind of set it on the side of the bed so that I don't know exactly how it does it, but it listens to your movements throughout the night. Oh, really? Yeah, and it can it uses that like nighttime activity, I guess, to measure and kind of calibrate like how good of quality of sleep you're having. It's kind of wild. And you see these graphs in the morning, you're like, whoa, what the heck? Because it shows you like the deep, deep sleep, it shows you more restless sleep, and it fluctuates throughout the night, and then it gives you a score. So. That's nice, because then you have something like a benchmark where you're always constantly trying to improve against, right? Yeah, yeah, interesting. So if you start maximizing your sleep, maybe take a month and like focus on that, and then you start hitting above 90% every night, you're like, okay, I got this dialed in, I'm getting pretty good at it. And then you could pick something else move on to something else. Yeah, yeah, I like it. Well, Christopher, this has been a fascinating man. I know we could talk about more, but for the sake of time and everything else that you've already got available and out there, we'll begin to wind things down. I do want to ask you some questions. The first one is what does it mean to be a man? Yeah, so I think it means what it means to be a man is to realize that you're not entitled to anything. And to take that approach in life, I think it's a very masculine approach to realize that you need to work for everything that you want to reap, essentially. So what you want to reap. And I told the story last time we recorded about my dad telling me that when I was a little kid, and I was complaining about we were raking the woods, which I still think is kind of nuts, but we were out in the woods, raking the woods, and we were bagging up all the leaves in the woods behind the house. And I was like, why the heck are we doing this? And he just turns to me, he's like, you're entitled to nothing. You need to work harder. You need to always remember that and work harder. You don't deserve to not do this pretty much. And of everything you said, I think that's stuck with me the most. And I was like, the more you think about it, that's a very masculine thing. That's a very masculine ideal. And it's really helped me a lot in my life since then. I was revert back anytime I want to complain, I'm like, man, fuck, no, I'm not entitled to this. Right, right. It's a powerful way to think. And then it causes, of course, that growth and you putting in the effort required to succeed. Yeah, I think that's probably a big difference between just anyone who's successful at anything and anyone who's not is doing that work and having that sort of mindset continually working on something, not stopping. Yeah, right on. Well, cool. How do we connect with you and learn about more about what you're doing and just connect? Yeah, probably the best place to connect, personally, is just on Instagram. It's an at underscore Christopher Walker. I check my DMS, or I try to check them often, answering questions people have. And then on YouTube, it's just Christopher Walker on YouTube. I've got a lot. If any of you are specifically seeking a lot of detailed information, there are hundreds of videos there, and I'll continue to be doing more. So there's a lot to learn over there if you're interested in this sort of thing. Yeah, your videos are great. I really like your videos, so I can't recommend those highly enough. Oh, cool. Thank you. Cool. Put a lot of work into those things. You can tell you do a great job, and it's really valuable information. So I get a lot from them. Thank you. Appreciate it. Right on. Well, we'll sync everything up so the guys know where to go and know where to connect. Christopher, I appreciate you for doing another round since we didn't get the first one right. But I guess since it's been so valuable, I know the guys are going to get a lot from this and I really appreciate you imparting some wisdom upon us. There it is, gents, my conversation with Christopher Walker. I hope that that was enlightening to you. I know we talked about a lot. I know it went in a couple of different places, but I think all of this is important in the grand scheme of how we increase our testosterone levels, which will inevitably help us perform better. It'll help us perform better with our spouses, with our interactions with them, of course, sexually as well, our sexual performance. It'll also help with our children. It'll help with the way that we show up in the gym and our physical fitness. It'll help in our business and the drive and the motivation and discipline and action towards those goals that we have in our business. It'll help in every facet of life. So if you are someone who wants to learn how to more adequately up your testosterone levels, then I would highly, highly suggest that you consider picking a book copy of Christopher's book, Master Your Tea. Again, it's a pretty in depth book here, but I think it's really going to shed some light on how we do this safely and naturally. Also connect with us on Instagram. I know Christopher is very, very active on Instagram as am I. Connect with us there or on Twitter or Facebook or wherever you're doing the social media thing. And as I said before, if you would, make sure you leave a rating and review. I think we're up to, I want to say 2,500 ratings and reviews, but it'd be good to get that up to about 3,000. So that means 500 ratings and reviews. If we really push this hard, I think we can. And ultimately, it's not about the ratings and reviews. It's about the visibility. It's about promoting this to other men in your life. Fathers, brothers, colleagues, coworkers, friends who need the information that we're sharing because they have a desire to be more fully the men that are capable of being as well. So guys, I want to say thank you as we sign out for today. Couldn't do this without you. Honored to be standing shoulder to shoulder in the battle to reclaim and restore masculinity. I'll let you get going until tomorrow for our Ask Me Anything, but until then take action and come the man you are with me."
