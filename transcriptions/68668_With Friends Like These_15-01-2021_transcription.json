Guiding us through this discussion is Liz Lynn's, who was on the show before to talk about another memoir, come piece of social criticism, Godland, a story of faith, loss in renewal in middle America.

I thank you so much for having me back. Well, I'm excited to talk about this book which minds a different part of your life. The particular one you've commodified in this book is motherhood. You are a mother. I am. I have two kids, nine and seven. What made you want to write this? Back when my youngest was a tiny baby, I was struggling to work and be a parent and find that space for myself. I kind of forced myself to get away and go to a writing conference, the Tin House Raiders workshop. I remember going there and hearing Maggie Nelson say something that has always stuck with me and she said that every story is the story of a body. I heard her say that and right around then I was writing about motherhood for Jezebel in a less personal way. There's the practical way this developed into a book but the reason I was writing about it is because our stories are the stories of our body and I wanted to write something else about motherhood. I wanted to write, I wanted to not write like, oh, it's such a blessing and I like nursing. Well, the birds chirp or even the more negative stuff which is, these are all fine and valid. I know I'm being sarcastic but they're all wonderful books which I have enjoyed but I wanted to carve a more political space for it because our bodies are politicized and I wanted to delve into that dissonance and say, wait a minute, wait a minute, this is not just a holy goddess experience. This is a political space and we need to talk about what it really means to be a mother in America. One of the things I noticed about your book and I think it's a kind of dance that you do that I really appreciate is that the book is about liminal spaces to me and you have to dance in that area between positive and negative and that must be really uncomfortable. Isn't that just honest living, right? It's honest living but you know what, it's not always presented in writing because it's we're writers, you know, the easiest thing to write is a pan. The easiest piece of writing you can do is something that's like, this sucks, this is horrible, I hate it. Second behind that is writing something that's celebratory, like this is awesome and I love it. The hardest stuff to write even though it is the truth is the stuff in the middle. I think that is such an embodied experience and of course I'm not trying to be exclusive here. I think that this experience in other bodies and other experiences but I think that that pain and pleasure that oppression and that freedom are really, they all come together I think in the experience of being pregnant and giving birth. And so it's the perfect way to kind of stay in that liminal space and say this is the this is bad, this is good, this is beautiful, this is disgusting, you know, this is how we find freedom, this our freedom is other people's oppression, right? So and I really struggled with writing it. There were times when like when I was writing about pain and like pain medicine, when I went into writing that chapter, I was fully expecting to be like, hell yes, pain medicine, it's great. Everybody get it. Let's all have epidurals right now. Let's just get them. But then I started researching and reading the history of pain medicine and realizing how it has been used as a tool of freedom. You know, there was that whole idea of like, well, women should be in pain because of Eve and that's your curse so bleed out on the table. We don't care. And pain medicine was freedom from that of saying like, no, actually, I don't have to be I don't have to live a life of pain. But it has also been used as a way to force sister actimes on, you know, poor women, disabled women, women in prisons and and and also the way that we've discovered pain medicine and a lot of life saving techniques have come at the expense of black women's bodies who did not consent, you know, to having, you know, like fistula experiments put on their bodies without pain medicine. So a lot of our freedom now comes at this expense and it didn't have to and it doesn't have to. And in case people don't know what you're saying is borne out by lots of research that the US has terrible infant mortality and maternal mortality rates for an industrialized country. The worst pro there's a big pro there's a big pro publica research on done a couple years ago. And a lot of that forms, I think the backbone of my book. What I kept thinking as I read your book was that pregnancy is a liminal state. And that one of the problems in our thinking about it is the inability to acknowledge it as neither this nor that or this and that it keeps getting split into mother and thing inside her mother versus thing inside her. Yes, yes. And that I think that that was such an interesting revelation when I was reading about like the history of ultrasounds and how ultrasounds have been politicized because once again, you know, ultrasounds have saved lives. But the way ultrasounds have been used as to take that interior space and to externalize it and then exert political control over a fetus which cannot survive outside of the mother. They're the same. And that's why I even talk about in the book, there's a fourth trimester, which is this kind of like newer concept, but it's really still part of pregnancy is that your baby is outside of you, but it's still very much a part of you. And this is not just like theoretical, like when you have a child, their cells get into you and your cells get into them. And that lasts for the rest of your life. Like even if you have a miscarriage that baby's cells are still a part of your body and science doesn't even know like what that means for you, but it's there. And so it's still like it's you can't separate the two and yet all of our politics, all we do is cleave the two in part. And when we do that, we sacrifice one for the other and we shouldn't have to do that. And over and over again, it's the mother. It's always the mother who has to die or who or whose rights are taken away or whose life is governed by rules that don't have any basis in science. Stupidity seems to continually win the day. It's because of that split and it's because of that split is not stupidity. Let's be, let's be real clear. It's not stupidity. I mean, there's stupidity in the laws, but that's not why that law was passed. That is a very fair point. We keep excusing. This is, this is a meta comment on America, but we keep excusing things with stupidity and really it's calculated evil. Lawmakers know like the, though even Jellicle right knows they did not always think abortion was bad. Catholics didn't always think abortion was bad. This is a new policy that came about in the 1980s and 1970s as a calculated way to get political power and divide the nation. And basically all of conservative politics since that sense Roe v Wade has been about this one single issue. Well, it's about preserving the blanket thing. It's about preserving patriarchy, white patriarchy. Yes, absolutely. And you know, and that's how you saw people or, you know, I saw people in my space and I will be like, well, I don't like Trump, but I'm going to vote for him anyway because of judges and we have to get rid of abortion. It's like, do we? If you really wanted to get rid of abortion, then you would just give women healthcare access. You'd give people human beings, not just women. You'd give all human beings access to healthcare. And then guess what you would see? It's such like a linear, you can draw a straight line from birth control policies, access to healthcare, a decline in abortions. I want to jump in and continue to talk about that cleave between mother and child that occurs in pregnancy that's scientifically false and ideological. And in point out that it actually continues even in less literal, less extreme ways that we think about pregnancy, like the way we judge mothers for what they eat or for how they take care of themselves, that that is also a view that splits apart the mother and child and privileges the child over the mother. Yes, we divide and it's like, oh, well, now that you're a mother, you know, you have to, you can't eat this or you can't do this or why? You know, now that you're a mother, you're not a full human being. And I actually think that does a real disservice to children because then they just think everybody's life is theirs to dispose of, you know, at their whim. And it's like, sorry. And I also want to back up and point out that this cultural narrowing of pregnant women's options specifically, gain weight, don't gain weight, exercise, don't exercise, all these things that are restrictive to pregnant women specifically, they perhaps can be seen as less extreme than the choice of whether or not to carry the term. But they have incredible emotional and psychological consequences that you write about, like that restrictions around eating is a really fascinating part of your book. And it's, it's, it isn't quote unquote life or death, I guess. But it, it, it contributes to pain. Women have never been able to eat. Who doesn't love to eat food is amazing. And I love it. But you know, our whole lives are in tension between, between just feeding and yourself. And then, you know, how your body is supposed to look or you don't even know your body's but like, are you even supposed to eat chips in public? You know, if you're not a certain weight or something, just makes me so mad that we, we do not allow women to eat freely. And that if you, and if you do, you know, it is policed in such a way and it becomes even more powerful in pregnancy because, because, and I know a lot of other people experience this, especially if you're termed quote unquote overweight, that people really feel like they are entitled to say anything about what you eat in public. Because bodies are policed all the time, all the time. And people who present as women, their bodies are policed all the time, all the time. But in pregnancy, because someone can see that you are pregnant or they think they can see that you're pregnant whole other problem. It somehow becomes okay to have opinions and express them. Well, that's the other side of this, right? Like this whole time I've been like, and there's negative side. But like you said, not everything's positive and negative. And, and I talk about that too. It's that people, I know women who have found power in their pregnancy, women who never felt like they could eat before now suddenly are saying, you know what? No, I actually need protein because I'm anemic and I have a baby in my body. So I'm going to eat the steak. And that there is a power, I think a lot about my former neighbor who I read about in the book with her permission, with her permission. But the, you know, how she had grown up in this very kind of confined religious space and then once she had children, she was able to advocate for herself as a mother. So she would say, no, I am the mother here. I don't want to do this. And then that became a real source of power and actually kind of self radicalization to just go to church anymore. And it's been, it's just been an incredible journey to watch her go on and kind of have these parallel lives together. But it's, you know, but, but it's also kind of sad too because women should have more cultural cash than just being mothers. Now a quick break to remind you of all the things you can consume. If you want to. I'd like to welcome new sponsor, Ollie Pop to the show. Regular listeners know that I'm on the constant hunt for good non alcoholic beverages, things that aren't too sweet or heavy on caffeine and that are good enough to savor rather than just suck down. So I am thrilled to have Ollie Pop as a sponsor. Ollie Pop is soda, but for grownups, it has the flavor profiles you might get nostalgic about, but it doesn't have any sugar or corn syrup or aspartame. There's vintage cola, classic root beer, orange squeeze, cherry vanilla and strawberry vanilla. And let's say you're not a frappuccino fan. Let's say you drink regular Coke. It has 39 grams of sugar in it. Orange Fanta has 44 grams. The Ollie Pop versions have less than six and they taste better, especially as the weather warms up or you want to pretend it's warming up and I'm speaking here of spring and not climate change, you're going to want to sip something that's cool and refreshing but won't like crank you up. Pour an ice cold Ollie Pop out and you know you are skipping the sugar and getting instead stuff like probiotics and other botanicals that support digestive health.

You point out as well that the other kind of place where women are allowed to have agency and demand what they want is in being a bride. And the continuity between these two things is when you're doing extreme performance of gender, then you get to ask for what you want. I thought a lot about that how we look at a mother as a monster and mothers demanding things and it is monstrous. Some brides are awful. Some moms are terrible. When I worked at summer camps in St. Peter, Minnesota, parents were the worst. They were monstrous. But once again, in these extreme performances of gender, it's where we find our absolute tyranny and absolute freedom to say, no. This is what I want. This is who I am. You know, in some ways, it was the power of being a mother that enabled me to finally ask for what I needed, you know, a career. I needed a time to have a career. In this whole time, I thought somebody would just hand it to me if I worked hard enough and then, you know, having that experience, I realized, no, this is something I have to take for myself. I have a very specific example to point out where it is problematic but good about that power of motherhood, which is the mom's demand movement about gun control, which every time I see it as a person who is a non-mother, I'm kind of like, I know you don't mean that, is such an interesting way to frame this entire debate. I, we saw that in the Black Lives Matter protests out in Portland where the wall of moms and, you know, and in some ways, it was a really good thing because it brought attention to, oh my God, look at what the police are doing. Nothing will still even do it to mothers. But then the point being is that mothers were out there the whole time, you know, so it's like, okay, it's great. Like, thank you for using your power to do that. But also, who's being erased in the process? I really hate it when people are like, and some other, you know, like, it comforts some sort of moral weight. Like, I'm sorry, you just like had a, I've had two kids. I'm actually not a better person. Let's zoom in on the incarceration of pregnant people, actually. I feel like I'm pretty knowledgeable about a lot of this stuff. This is a chapter and a lot of information that I had not known about because it is because I don't have to. Part of that is because I don't have to, right? Which is the actual criminalization of motherhood. Like, you're not speaking metaphorically. When a pregnant woman is incarcerated, what happens then? You can speak about that if you like, although it's very disturbing. And then also the ways that we've constructed a system that takes away children. From their poor mothers, they're poor mothers who are women of color. So specifically with incarcerated mothers, you know, if they are, if they're pregnant, while jailed, you know, the whole birth experience is horrible. It would be being shackled to the bed, being denied pain medicine, being denied somebody there to give you comfort and aid and help, you know, being denied necessary, like prenatal health care. And then you give birth and what you have a couple, a couple hours sometimes with your baby before it's taken away. You know, in the book, I have a story of a woman who refused to eat just so she could have some extra time with her baby. And then her child has taken away, given away to someone else. And we have this like set of laws in many states where if a mother is away from her children for so long, then they get put into a state system. And so it's like you don't even have a chance to be a mother. Because these laws that judge if you haven't been with your child, if the child has been in foster care for a certain amount of time, well, then clearly you're an unfit mother. So we're taking the child away permanently. Yes. And you know, and then there's, you know, and then there's also the way we criminalize poverty too. You know, there's case after case after case of black mothers having their children taken away from them because they let them sit at a park while they went in for a job interview. So I want to talk a little bit about non mothers, female presenting non mothers, not just female presenting non mothers, anyone who's not a mother who inhabits that female space. I confess. And when I picked up the book, I was like, well, this will be an interesting sociological project for me. You know, I will find out more about motherhood and that's good. And I am a feminist. So I really want to be educated on this stuff. And the realization I had was, no, this is not just a sociological investigation for a non mother to read this and to think about motherhood because the ideal of motherhood resonates outward to encompass so many other kinds of oppression, basically so many other kinds of systemic patriarchy. The ways that we are judged about, because you talked to this only one right way to be a mother, there's only a few ways you have to be a woman. And it often includes motherhood. Well, I find that the people who think about motherhood the most are the ones who choose or through life have made had that choice made for them about motherhood the most are the people who are not mothers. Because they're the ones who constantly have to answer for why aren't you, why aren't you you know, and and and I do hope I did try to grapple with that in the book a little bit that you know, that when you are not in the space, it's it's something that is forced that you have to grapple with an almost a more honest way than somebody who's like, okay, little baby, did it check, you know, I don't know, I was more honest, it's just it's just one of the things that again kind of resonates outward. But I think of it as you know, throwing a stone into a pool or whatever, that my life is deeply affected by the ways we think about motherhood. You know, the questions I get asked, the choices that I have, some of which are, you know, this liminal space like, I have a lot of freedom, right, because I don't have to raise a child. I admit that I'm not, I'm not unaware. But you know, the accusation of selfishness is something that is propelled by the way we think about motherhood. Oh, yeah. Any any any woman presenting person who takes time for themselves, whether that is through not having a child or you do have a child and then you choose to take time for yourself, always selfishness, that that investment in self or that focus on self is like, Oh, my God, how dare you as if the whole purpose of our lives is to go out and bleed for someone else. Like the goal of my life is not misery. Now popping in to let you know about our sponsors who make this show possible, please support them and let them know where you heard about them.

As I've gotten older, there are some things I become less sensitive about. My feelings don't get hurt as much. I don't take things so personally, but I've also gotten more sensitive, mainly to sugar and caffeine. I can have some, but not a lot. So I choose carefully. Like when I drink coffee, I have to make it really count. And that is where super coffee comes in. It adds healthy fats and proteins to help cut jitters caused by caffeine and it is sweetened without sugar. It has 10 grams of protein, zero added sugars. Do you like your mocha-chinos or your fraps, the ones with 50 or 60 grams of sugar? Super coffee can give you the same satisfaction, the same feeling of a midday treat, but without the caffeine or sugar crash three hours later. Super coffee was founded by three brothers, Jordan, Jake and Jim D'Chitiko. They pitched their idea on Shark Tank and I am told they have many celebrity investors, including Green Bay Packers, quarterback Aaron Rodgers. I look this up and not only is it true, but he has a very podcast-driven portfolio, including former sponsors, Hymns, Mac Weldon and Nom Nom Pet Food. I hope that means he listens to podcasts.

Do people express opinions about you as a mother in public? Is that something that you've ever experienced? What? No, never. Absolutely never. What's actually more interesting to me is when people erase my motherhood. From the narrative, when this has happened actually in the past year, being a well for a time, I was a local columnist. And when I would criticize lawmakers, it'd be like, well, how dare you talk about this mother? I'm a mother. This actually happened a lot with when I wrote about Amy Coney Barrett weaponizing her motherhood. And there was this whole thing where there was this institutionalized Catholic response to look at these liberals criticizing motherhood. How dare they? I'm a mother. And I love being a mother. But it's yes. Oh, yes. I mean, people do criticize it. I do really try hard to keep the kids' memes out of public. I keep their faces out of public and to the extent that I can do that as much as possible. But yes, people have. But it's interesting to me when it is erased from the narrative. And I often think that that is because now I am a single mother. And so, and the experience of writing this book was really hard because I sold the book as a married white upper middle-class mother of a boy and a girl. I did it. I accomplished it. High five to me. And then when I sat down to write the book, I was very broke, very in debt, a single mother. And my circumstances had completely changed. And I remember telling somebody, like, I'm going to buy my way out of this book contract because I cannot write the book that I said I was going to write. And my friend Matthew Celesis, he's an incredible writer. Everybody read all his books. He's coming out with a craft book this year. And, but he was like, write it into the book. Like, that's the dissonance, right? That's, you have to write that into the book. And so I did it to the best of my abilities. But yeah, it's, you know, it's the experience of going from like idealized motherhood, which was terrible to, you know, this other kind of dissonant motherhood space, which is awesome and I love it. So I want to get a little more personal, but I feel uncomfortable asking the question, although one of the reasons I'm asking it is because I know for a fact that other people must ask you this because you're a mother in public, which is so why do you become a mom anyway? You know, that's such an interesting question. And I am glad you asked it. I, you know, there's, I will just say like as a blanket, there's a lot of questions people don't feel like they should ask women. And I think that that is those are interesting. I like to hear those debates. No, and I think it's a great question. Um, that is something I really struggled with because when I got married, I'll just let's get honest. Like let's get real honest. I, I'm number two of eight children, um, raised evangelical and I when, and a lot of family trauma, a lot of, uh, you know, um, I love my parents. We have a good relationship, but growing up in a household with two bipolar people meant that I was stepping on eggshells all the time. And I did not want to replicate that experience for my children. I did not want to have children if that's what their life was going to be like. And, um, but I got married to a person who really wanted to have children in a nine site, you know, and it would not have been a great idea. And, um, but the end result is here and we're happy. But the, um, you know, and I really struggled with that. You know, I was like, I will, you know, I was like, Max, I'll have two kids. Ideally one, I don't know if I can do any of that. And I sent myself to therapy for years. I held off having children for years until I could finally say to myself, I think I've, you know, like I've healed or at least I'm in a place where I can work on myself as a human being to raise another human being. And, um, you know, it was really difficult. I, um, again, I was married to somebody who really wanted children. Um, I'm not saying I didn't choose it, but I think the choice came a little sooner than what of the five been, you know, with somebody a little bit more, um, you know, uh, open to waiting a little longer. But I remember holding my baby, my first baby, my daughter, and just being scared out of my mind, like just having her. It was like a really kind of traumatic birth. Um, and then just holding her and then just being like, how to, this is the scariest thing I've ever done. Cause now I have to raise this human in a world that is really scary and we'll hurt her, you know, it's going to hurt her. I'm sorry, but like, you know, and then I was like, why did I do this? Why did I bring? Why did I bring two perfect human beings into a world that is just going to hurt them eventually? And, um, I don't know. That's something I still think about a lot. And I think that that's the struggle. I'm so happy I had them. They are the best. Um, I love them and I love that the world gets to have them. Um, that I think is maybe the redemption. And it's the thing I tell my friends to, you know, when they're like, I want to have kids, but I'm scared. I'll be like, the world's going to be so lucky to have those people in this place. And, um, I don't know. Yeah, it's tough. There's not great answers, but I am glad I did it. I love motherhood. Yeah. I think you gave the answer. I really do. I think you gave the answer is that you have provided a source of joy to the world and you have created beings who will be joyful. There is, you know, net joy, like, and discovery and invention and change that is not possible unless, you know, there's new people in the world, like, we, the world really will not change if we just stop. And I think there's great arguments where people are like, Oh, children are just going to like be a drain on the world's resources. And it's like, okay, I get, I mean, growing up one of eight kids, I had a lot of people being like, why do you not have so many kids just ruining the environment? And it's just was like, guys, this is not a hypothetical. These are human lives who are here and who exist. And human life will exist whether, you know, people choose to have kids or not. And people's choices are their choices. And you can answer this question in whatever kind of frame of mind you wish. But I am curious about however, whatever the answer is, which is actually going back to the pandemic. You finished this book, obviously long before the time of quarantine, the time of no school, the time of not being able to see your friends, children, as you referenced earlier. An enormous impact on everyone. Yes, let's say everyone, but mothers in this moment. Oh, gosh, you know, this has comprised the bulk of my writing, I think for a pandemic, that this is, you know, this is a time where all the crises that we've built up with the lack of childcare, the lack of maternity leave, the lack of healthcare, the lack of affair and working wage for all people has culminated in a huge crisis for mothers, where we are seeing the fact that like, where we relied on mothers for free labor and free labor in so many ways, because not just the free labor of like, now you've birthed the tax base, right? Like, let's just be as, you know, critical as possible. But like, you know, if women don't get birth, you don't have anybody text, so you can't build your stupid roads. Like, so let's just like be honest, like you don't have anybody to work at your Amazon warehouses. So this is like a critical part of the economy, but it's one we don't invest in and one we refuse to bail out. And then it's also free labor, not just through, you know, the birthing, but in who watches children, it is the frontline workers who are the lowest paid and the ones who are suffering the most. So, so we've now it's kind of culminated into this crisis moment where the government answer to these problems is we'll just figure it out. And women are dropping out of the workforce. A recent study that just came out a couple of days ago showed that while men and white women have made job gains, it is women of color who have not been able to come back from this pandemic. And by the way, pandemic's still happening, but it's incredible to see who is benefiting and who is losing. And it is always compounded. And by who we rely on for the free, unpaid labor of our society that makes our society work. If that's always very nicely to another question I wanted to ask you, which is you write in the book about the way that women were more able to be controlled when we cleaved work and home and funnel women into the home. Hey, I don't know if you noticed, but that cleavage. It has been erased again. We are now in a place where work and home are the same. So what do you, what do you, well, okay, yes, what do you think? Because I was when I was reading that part in the book, I was like, oh, shit. You know, yes, we separated work and home in order to make women do all the unpaid labor, basically. I'm vastly short-handing history here. But now what's happening? But now women are, it's actually compounding the problem. You would think that it would have erased the problem. But, you know, I have a friend who used to work for a university. And she used to because her job required her to forget like she's working out of the home. And her job is like, and she's like, I need flexible hours and trying to homeschool my kid. And, you know, my husband's a frontline worker, all this kind of stuff. And they're like, deal with it. And she can't. Uh, it's impossible. And so she had the luxury of being able to say, okay, I choose not to do this anymore. But, um, you know, and that's, I hear over and over again, companies, maybe for a time, they were like a little understanding. But now that it is just this like thing where it's like, we'll just get your work done because this dude over here can, well, he can because his wife is in the other room, keeping the kids quiet, you know? And so I actually think it's kind of made it worse where you would think that like merging work and home would kind of erase some of these, um, you know, false binaries that we have. But really it's just kind of compounded the problem because we don't have a society that sees all people as complicated people. Honestly, you know, if we had bosses who saw fathers as fathers and said, okay, here's, you know, like, um, you know, here's a more flexible work week. So not just my female employees can take care of their kids. But so my male employees can take care of their kids. And you know, I've been thinking about this a lot. I mean, we're talking, I've been thinking about this a lot through a pandemic is, you know, we really do not have a society that allows dads to be dads. Just a thought I had on this, which is that although we have seemingly collapsed work and home again, I think the problems that you're talking about have to do with our inability to find that gray area in our thinking about work and home. Yeah. Yes. And that's the way, like that's why binaries are so oppressive in every aspect. Sexuality are conceptions of politics and everything. Bionaries are bad and inherently inherently inherently oppressive. And whenever you divide things into two and only two, that's when you see the biggest problems and we're talking specifically about home versus work. And yes, like we have been like, oh, well, you're either at work or you're either at home and you can only do one or the other. And the reality is that once again, people are full complicated human beings. And sometimes it often, you know, a fullness of self is a fullness of all things. And also, but like also, I just hate that because I was getting ready to be like, look, they're a better worker. What the hell? Like somebody's whole like identity is in value is based upon whether they can like make money for a company or themselves. Again, it's disgusting, but that's kind of where we are. But let's talk about it because I do think it provides an opportunity. Do I believe that coming out of this pandemic, all of a sudden we're going to be like, hell yeah, let's do health care. Let's do childcare free universal preschool. Everybody gets it. No, I don't think that, but it gives us a really great way to fight for it. And I also am a person who believes I don't like cynicism. I think that if you want, this is our fight. Liz. Thank you so much for coming back to the show. I love talking to you. Thank you so much for having me. And that is it for the show.
