    "text": " Today on the Matt Wall Show, there's been a dramatic increase in violent incidents on airplanes. There's also been a dramatic increase in violent incidents everywhere else in the country. What does all this add up to? We'll talk about that. Also, Five Headlines, Joe Biden continues to mentally decay in front of the world. If you haven't seen the latest video of this, it's pretty startling. Kaitlyn Jenner says that he's the victim of transphobia from the left. Are the Dems in fact the real transphobes? And CNN's Anna Navarro defends public masturbator Jeffrey Tubin. Her defense is pretty pathetic. Finally, in our daily cancellation, we'll discuss the increasing efforts to normalize so-called sex work, a.k.a. prostitution, all of that, and more today on the Matt Wall Show. So what are you going to do about the fact that it seems like every company, especially this month, is going full woke? Well, one of the things you could do is find the gloriously unwoke companies, and I mean that in the best way possible and support them. One of them is Charity Mobile. You don't have to worry about Charity Mobile doing the woke thing. They're not going to do it. One company that fits the description of a company that's on our side of the culture war is Charity Mobile. That's the pro-life phone company. 5% of your monthly plan price goes to the pro-life pro-family charity of your choice. And what that means is that you're helping to build a culture of life in America while supporting a pro-life phone company. And you're also getting a great service on top of that. I can attest to a bit of Charity Mobile customer for, I don't know, a year now or something. And it's been a great experience. A lot of perks to get new activations and eligible accounts get a free cell phone with free activation and free shipping. There's no contracts, there's no termination fees, and there's no risk with a 30-day guarantee. There's also live customer service base right here in the USA, which is good for a number of reasons. Also, it's American Jobs. So another reason to support Charity Mobile. This is nationwide service on America's largest and most reliable 4G LTE network. So call them at 1-877-474-3662 or chat with them online at charitymobile.com. You may not have heard about this incident, but it seems pretty notable to me, or at least it should be notable. Newsweek has the report. It says, a Delta Airlines pilot asked strong males to help to do a problem passenger who turned out to be an off-duty flight attendant during a chaotic flight from Los Angeles to Atlanta on Friday. A Delta spokesperson reportedly said the unnamed off-duty flight attendant hijacked the plane's public address system to speak to passengers about their oxygen masks during flight 1730, which prompted a dramatic tussle with passengers. The pilot told passengers, this is the captain speaking, we'd like all strong males to come to the front of the aircraft to handle a problem passenger. Now, what does that tell you, by the way, all strong males? You notice he called for strong males. He didn't call for any women because in that moment, when you're up 30,000 feet in the air and there's something happening and needs to be contained, there's no time to worry about political correctness. We need the strong guys here. That's kind of interesting. That's not really the point though. Video of the chaos was posted to Twitter by a passenger who witnessed it and she posted the clip explaining quote that someone tried to hijack our plane from LAX to Atlanta. So that's what she said, hijack the plane. Here's what that video looks like. Let's watch a little bit of it. Okay, so you see a whole bunch of guys tuss. Carefully see much. This is certainly the kind of thing you don't want to see when you're on an airplane. All right, eventually they contain the guy and then they made an emergency landing. And there you go. Now, you look at that video and you hear the story. If you feel like you already heard this same story a few weeks ago and saw video kind of like that, that's because you did or something very similar to it. In that case, it was a flight also from LA. This was two weeks ago or so. You may be noticing a pattern. Both of these are from LA. This time it was heading to Nashville and a quote unruly passenger tried to break into the cockpit that was tackled and restrained by a group of flight attendants. Now these alleged attempted hijackings or whatever they were may not have been very sophisticated and they may not have had any real chance of success. It's not like the plane was ever in any danger of being taken down, but still two in less than a month seems like a lot. And in fact, a lot doesn't begin to cover it. There has been a huge rise in violent and dangerous behavior on flights that mostly aren't attempted hijackings, but even so, the figure cited by Newsweek and the same article are just outrageous and almost impossible to believe. Listen to this quoting out says in early May, the federal aviation administration warned air travelers about a significant rise in dangerous behavior aboard flights on in 2021. There are usually 100 to 150 official instances of unruly passengers passenger behavior in a typical year. But listen to this, that figure leaped to more than 1,300 in the first four months of this year, according to the agency, 1,300 in four months as opposed to 100 or so in a whole year. In fact, a BBC article says that US airlines have reported 3,000 unruly passengers this year. Now there might be a distinction being drawn here between dangerous and unruly, which may explain the disparity. But whether we're looking at 1,300 or 3,000, there's obviously something going on here. A part of the problem is certainly the masking policies I would guess. A certain number of those unruly passengers may have simply been not wearing a mask or not wearing it correctly and were categorized as unruly and kicked off the plane. I don't know if all these toddlers we see getting kicked off planes because they're not wearing masks or do they go down in the books officially as unruly, I don't know. And certain other instances, certain other passengers in these videos have become unruly because of disputes over masks. And in general, flying is a high stress situation in a claustrophobic environment already. Any additional annoyances or discomforts added, like having to wear a muzzle on your face the whole time will only increase the likelihood of confrontations. So that must account for some of the rise in dangerous behavior on flights. But it probably doesn't account for all of it, especially when you consider that this problem extends far beyond the airline industry. Every other day, there's another video circulating online of massive bras breaking out, sometimes in airports and on planes, but also in restaurants, malls, anywhere else. Add to that the much publicized videos of people being randomly assaulted in the street. We hear about the Asian victims of these kinds of crimes, but the problem is not limited to Asian victims. And then of course, there's the surge in violent crime across the country generally as many of our biggest cities see record numbers of murders, assaults, robberies, etc. It's such as violent crime either. San Francisco has seen a rise in shoplifting that's so dramatic that it's putting many stores out of business. The independent reports that Walgreens has had to close down 17 locations just due to so-called petty theft. Speaking of which, video posted yesterday shows a shoplifter literally loading a garbage bag with stolen goods and then casually riding his bike. Yeah, he rode his bike into the store, riding it out of the store while security guards look on helplessly, not doing anything about it. Let's watch some of that footage here. Yeah, now the security guards are filming it, but as it looks like the employee in a security guard, he makes a kind of lackadaisical attempt to grab the bag, but then gives up and says that, never mind, you can take it. And you get here, I think it was the employee saying, should we call 911? And I don't know whether they called 911 or not, but they probably didn't because it's been made clear that the cops are not going to pursue criminals like this because they're not going to be prosecuted. Yeah. Now, you think about San Francisco, between the homeless people defecating in the street, the heroin addicts throwing their needles all over the sidewalk, shoplifter strolling out of drugstores with garbage bags full of merchandise, San Francisco is just a lovely place to live. And by lovely, I mean, it's a God for sake and hellscape, not unlike many other cities in this country. And so far, listing all of these things, we haven't said anything about the rioting, which plagued our cities last summer and has now coincidentally tapered off, now that there's a Democrat in office, but even so, the precedent has been set that mobs of opportunistic scumbags can pour into the street and set fire to random buildings whenever they're upset about something. And they'll face almost no consequence. Unless they're right-wing, in which case, even if they're trespassing, they're going to be hunted down by the federal government thrown in jail for 20 years. And all of this is to say nothing of the suicide epidemic among kids, which we discussed at some length yesterday. Now, add all of this together. And what do you get? Not much, I suppose, except maybe the breakdown of human society. That's all. I mean, any one of these factors rioting homicide epidemic people beating the hell out of each other on airplanes may not signify a societal breakdown on its own, but put them all together at the same time. And I'm not sure what else to call it. The interesting question is why this is happening. I think there's really no question that we're looking at the breakdown of society. The question really is why and why right now. As for that, I think three contributing factors should be mentioned, though this is far from an exhaustive list. One, it's not a coincidence that many of us predicted this sort of thing well over a year ago when the government locked us all in our homes. We were exactly right, but we didn't need to be prophets or fortune tellers to see it coming. You cannot shut down a society of 330 million people for any length of time and expected to start back up again like nothing happened. In sci-fi movies, you can cryogenically freeze an individual person for a year or a hundred years or whatever and then thaw them out and they'll be good as new, right? In the movies, but even in the movies, you can't do that to an entire society. That doesn't work in fiction, let alone reality. There are consequences to such a drastic and unnecessary measure. Even when you open things back up and you hope that everything's going to go back to normal, it doesn't work that way. There are going to be serious consequences, catastrophic consequences. In fact, and we're seeing them right now, I would argue. Two, another factor also is that trust in and respect for authority is probably at an all-time low. Some of that is deserved. Nobody trusts or respects our politicians nor should they, but then police also have been demonized as departments are defunded and even the departments that aren't defunded have trouble recruiting new talent. Why would anyone want to be a cop with the knowledge that they'll be branded a racist murderer at the outset? And if they ever have to use deadly force, God forbid, they may well go to prison for it, whether it was justified or not. And if they even if they don't go to prison for it, their life's going to be ruined. And three, I think the final factor we should note, this is nothing new, but we should mention combined with these other ingredients, there is the general lack of meaning and purpose among so many in our civilization as the flight from God and religion, theistic religion anyway continues. So we have a society of people already in despair, many of them from their sense of meaninglessness who are then torn out of their normal lives by a lockdown, which was unnecessary. And at the same time, the structures of authority are destabilized, mixed all that together, poured in a pan, sticking in the oven, and this is what you cook up. What's the good news? Well, that was really the end of what I had to say. I don't have any good news. That's it. But I will say this, one thing you can do, get out of the cities. That's for sure. Move to the country. That's where you need to be. Let's get now to our five headlines. Well, I don't know about you. I think about the things I love doing during the summer. I do it is nice to be inside an air conditioning as much as possible, especially down here in Tennessee where the humidity is like walking into a brick wall. But if I'm going to be inside in the air conditioning, I don't want to be walking around an auto parts store. That's not where I want to be inside my own house. And the great thing about Rock Auto is if I need auto parts, I can sit in the comfort of my own home and just pull out my phone, get on my laptop, and find all the parts I need. I don't need to walk aimlessly around that auto parts store, ask all these questions about my car. I can't answer any of them because I don't know a lot about cars. And then I get upset, I start crying and I run out of the store. It's happened so many times. I'm sure it's happened to you. And that's why you need Rock Auto for a lot of other reasons too, because they offer the lowest price as possible. They're not changing the prices. They're not going to try to get as much money as they can out of you. It's just that if you get it there, it's the lowest price possible. They're a family business and honest business. They've been serving auto parts customers online for 20 years. You can go to rockauto.com to shop for auto and body parts from hundreds of manufacturers. The catalog is unique and very easy to navigate. So if you want to experience it for yourself, go to rockauto.com right now. See all the parts available for your car truck and as always remember to write Walsh in there. How did you hear about this box so they know that we sent you? All right. So staying on the bad news, which could really be the name of the show, I guess, the bad news with Matt Walsh. Why didn't we think of that? It's just coming to me now. Anyway, it's probably a little bit hard to market. So let's go here. Joe Biden is getting ready for his talk with Putin and he was asked by a reporter what he plans to say to Putin. And I want to show you his response. Now, it it we've seen a lot of this kind of thing from Joe Biden. So sort of nothing new about it. And we get so used to it. They think, Oh, there's there's old Joe Biden again, having a brain fart. Now, this is not a brain fart. Okay, this is someone who's losing their mind experiencing mental decay in front of cameras, in front of the whole world. And it's it's bad and embarrassing. But let's let's watch it first of all. Thanks for the first question. I'm laughing too. They actually, well, look, I mean, he has made clear that. The answer is, I believe he is in the past, essentially acknowledge that he was a certain things that he would do or did do. What was that? I don't even understand the answer. In the past, he's acknowledged that there were certain things he would do or did do. Okay. And what is what would do in the past? What does that mean? Well, there's no point in trying to dissect this or get into it. This is again, someone who's experiencing rapid, rapid mental decline in front of the entire world. I think at this point, it's been very obvious all along, but now it seems all but certain that Joe Biden most likely is not going to be the president when we get to 2024. I mean, to the not not even voting out of office, but he's not going to be the guy. It's going to be Kamala Harris by the time we get there. Now, it's really just a question of when it's really there's two questions now. When does this official transition of power happen and how does it happen? We're going to find out. And when it gets to the point where Joe Biden is completely unable to fulfill the duties of the presidency, you could argue he's at that point right now. But we don't, that's the thing. We don't really know how bad it actually is at this point. What we know right now is that in front of cameras, he loses his train of thought a lot, and then he starts babbling and coherently. And that's pretty disturbing and that's troubling. But what is it like behind the scenes? When he's not in front of cameras, when he's sitting in his, in the Oval Office, can he basically does he basically have his wits about him? It's possible. But the point is we're not necessarily going to know. There's a line. We don't know where the line is, where he is no longer able to fulfill the duties of the presidency. Where is that line? When has when does he cross it? Has he already crossed it? And will we be told when he crosses it? This is a full on constitutional crisis that we're looking at potentially we may already be in one. And what makes this so frustrating is just like the consequences of the lockdown. This was so foreseeable. Of course, this is going to happen when you when you elect a 78 year old man who's already in cognitive decline. And then you take him and you put him in the most stressful job on earth. We've all unfortunately most of us have because because Alzheimer's is so common, dementia is so common. Most of us have had experience with seeing this with loved ones. And so you know, if you have say your grandfather, grandmother who went through this, you know how quickly you start seeing the warning signs. And then it's kind of like they're gradually headed to this cliff and then they fall off the cliff. And it happens very fast. And you know that happens when your grandfather, your grandmother is retired. And they're sitting at home all day playing with the grandkids relatively stress free life. Still the decline is exponential until you fall off the cliff. And it's like they just aren't even there anymore. And it's very sad. Okay, so we know that that happens exponentially with a retired person in a stress free life. What about when you when you put them in in one of the most physically and mentally demanding jobs on the planet? And also one of the most consequential and important jobs on the planet. It's just crazy. We knew this was going to happen. Of course it's going to happen. And even a lot of, even plenty of conservatives who are Biden critics, I've been making this point all along. I'm certainly not the only one, but those of us who've been making this point about Joe Biden, they's too old. I can only speak for myself, but I've heard from a lot of even conservatives saying, yeah, you know, I don't like Joe Biden, but that's not the reason. That's not the reason not to vote for him. Let's not be agist. Okay. My grandmother is a 85 and she's sharp as a tack. A lot of that kind of nonsense. Yeah, you're right that there are a lot of other reasons not to vote for Joe Biden. But actually you didn't really need any other reasons because the fact that he's 78 is reason enough. You simply should not be electing 78 year olds to the presidency and we should never do this again. It's embarrassing. It's humiliating. It's catastrophic. You're asking for a crisis on 10 different levels and you're going to get it. There are realities. I don't want to hear any of this. It's ageism, a shut up. It's not ageism to root to acknowledge the reality of age. It's not ages to simply notice that age exists and there are certain realities that come with it because we are mortal creatures living in a physical frame that deteriorates over time. I know it's not fun to think about. Nobody likes to think about it, but it's true. Your 85 year old grandmother is sharp as a tack for an 85 year old. Not in general. She's not as sharp as she was when she was 45. She wasn't. She's not. Nobody is. Unless you're telling me she's literally superhuman. Bring her to a, we got to discover she's discovered the elixir of immortality. Bring her to a lab somewhere. Maybe we could figure out what's going on. Aside from that, she maybe sharp as a tack for an 85 year old. That doesn't mean that at her age she is suited to do one of the most stressful important jobs on planet earth. Sharp as a tack for an 85 year old means that they can hold a conversation and they can play with the grandkids and all that kind of stuff, which is great. I hope that I can do all that when I'm 85. I hope I'm still alive when I'm 85. That doesn't mean you put them in the, in the Oval Office. We, we shouldn't after 80. We shouldn't even have to talk about whether 80 year old should be president, of course not. 80 year olds shouldn't even be driving. Okay, in a sane society, you wouldn't have that. Okay. This is, this is, we, we, we cannot, can we all, and I know we can't agree to it because that's the other frustrating thing. We should, after this experience, we should all be able to agree. We're never doing this again. We're not going to elect a 78 year old. Nobody should turn 80 in the Oval Office. Nobody. I wish we could agree. We could make a pinky promise with each other, but we can't. Can we? Because you know, the, the elephant in the room here is that, I say we shouldn't elect a 78 year old to the presidency ever again. I mean it, but Donald Trump will be 78 in 2024. Am I applying this to him? Yes, absolutely, because he is also a mortal creature who is susceptible to physical and mental decline, like anybody is. All right. Let's go to number two from the Daily Wire. Reading out says California gubernatorial candidate Caitlyn Jenner slammed late night host Jimmy Kimmel after he called Jenner Trump in a wig during his show on Thursday night. Kimmel celebrated the end of Keeping Up With Kardashians, which ran for 20 seasons across 14 years and inspired 10 spin-offs, 10 spin-offs of Keeping Up With The Kardashians. I didn't even know there was one. There's 10. My Lord. Kimmel said, anyway, I'm not going to repeat his jokes. It's not even really funny, but then he, then he made a joke that Caitlyn Jenner is Donald Trump in a wig. And then there was some outrage about that, but, but not from the left, of course. It was from the right. And Jenner called out Kimmel, the left and the LGBT community on Twitter, on Friday. He tweeted, quote, last night Jimmy Kimmel called me Donald Trump with a wig. He obviously believes that trans women are simply men with wigs on. Well, where's the outrage from the left or LGBT community being woke must be optional if you're a Democrat. And of course, there, as I said, plenty of people on the right jumping on this bandwagon and saying, oh, where's this is transphobia? Where's the outrage from the left? Where's the outrage? And yes, okay. It is hypocrisy. Of course it is. We all understand that. If Jimmy Kimmel had made this joke about any other trans person that I can even think of, because all the other ones that come to mind are on the left, any other prominent trans person in the public eye or not prominent. If he had chosen any other target for that joke, who's transgender and it's not Caitlyn Jenner, yes, there would be there would be tremendous outrage on the left and he would be, well, the joke never would have been made in the first place. So we don't have to think about it. But if somehow it was, then there would be tremendous outrage. And he'd be forced to issue an apology and all the rest of it. Calling a quote unquote trans woman, a man in a wig, yes, from the left in every other circumstance, they're going to call that blatant transphobia and it's unacceptable and it's probably a hate crime. However, does that mean that we on the right should jump on this bandwagon and say, hey, this is transphobia. But we're outraged by it. Why aren't you? You guys are the real trans folks. Should we be doing that? Should we do that whole routine? The answer is no, we shouldn't. And I'll tell you why, two reasons. Number one, and this is something we all need to try to understand and keep in mind. The left, they don't care about their hypocrisy. Not only do they not care about it, but it's the point. The hypocrisy is the point that shows their cultural power. What they're saying is we make the rules. Yeah, obviously the rules don't apply to us like they do to you. Thanks for noticing. We're the ones in charge. Clearly, we don't care in general about quote unquote transphobia. This is a, this is a tool that we use to bludge in our opponents. You're our opponents. We're not going to bludge in ourselves with the tool. That's the left. They will all but come out and say that it's clearly their strategy. So by pointing out, by merely pointing out the hypocrisy in this way, it doesn't achieve much because it, yeah, we all know it, but they know it too. And so what's the point? The hypocrisy is the point because it's all about power. That's the first problem with the Democrats are the real transphobe thing. The second is that in order to criticize the left on their own grounds, right, by throwing their own labels back at them and I understand the temptation to do this because you're saying, well, yeah, we're going to, we're going to make them take a dose of their own medicine. We're going to hold them to their own standard and all this kind of stuff. The problem is that to criticize them on their terms, not only is it ineffectual because they don't care, but also it requires you to adopt their presuppositions. By criticizing them on their terms, they've already won because you're agreeing with them. So the left, they can, when they hear, when they hear people on the right, non ironically using the term transphobia, the left, they can sit back and say, well, our work here is done. You suckers. You think when you start calling them transphobes, they're, they're, they're cowering in fear. Oh no, they're calling us transphobes. What would we do? We've been defeated. We've been bested at our own game. Oh, drat. We would have got away with it too. If not for you darn kids. Oh, not at all. They're saying, okay, thank you. Thanks for agreeing with us. By using a term like transphobia, you're agreeing with them. You're seeding the point. You're surrendering the ground. You're adopting their philosophical presuppositions. On the right, what we should know is that first of all, transphobia is not a thing. I'm not going to accuse anyone of being a transphobe. That's not a thing. Phobe is fear. No one's afraid of trans people. The people like myself who are critical of the concept of transgenderism is not, it's not out of fear. It's out of understanding of science and logic. It's a logical criticism, not a fear-based one. And also, frankly, observing that a male with long hair is not a woman, that's not bigotry. Even if it's hypocritical coming from Jimmy Kimmel, it's still not bigotry. And so I'm not going to say that it is. Even in an attempt to score a point against Jimmy Kimmel, because you're not going to score the point anyway. All right, let's move on to Anna Navarro. Okay, we got to play this. Anna Navarro on the view yesterday was offering a defense of speaking of double standards. Here we go. Was offering a defense of Jeffrey Tubin masturbating in front of his co-workers. And there's no way to really set this up. We just have to, we have to listen and gawk in amazement at this rationalization. Are you surprised to see him back on the air? You know, actually, I'm not surprised he's back on the air, but I will tell you when I saw that interview. Oh, God, how embarrassing, how humiliating. I kept thinking to myself, if I have to go on live TV and explain to the nation why I masturbated on a Zoom call, I think I'd rather go sell avocados under I-95 than get my job back on TV. Look, I think some instances of sexual harassment are black and white. Some instances are more nuanced. In this case, he was not sexually harassing anybody. He didn't have the intent to sexually harass somebody. He was sexually harassing himself, maybe. Okay, he was on a Zoom call. It was an accidental exposure. It was not a CNN Zoom call. It was with the New Yorker from where he has been terminated and faced consequences. He was off CNN for many months during the elections, during some of the hottest political and legal times. CNN is a for-profit business. If viewers don't like it, then they should make their views known. If they want to have some grace, if they want to say, we're not going to cancel a guy because he made a stupid mistake, I think his bigger problem is, frankly, with himself, with his family, with his wife, then it is with his CNN colleagues, because it was not something that was done to us. More nuanced. This is not black and white sexual harassment. Okay. Well, black and white sexual harassment is, you want to talk about black and white straightforward. That's like a male coworker tells a female coworker that she looks nice in that dress. That's straightforward. No nuance there. Okay. That right there. Now, you want to know that's a Me Too movement material. That's someone needs to be fired, probably arrested, put them in, send them down to Gitmo. But, yeah, we got to, there are more nuanced situations like a guy masturbating in front of his cards. Now, if you were to compliment or on her dress, again, straightforward, but masturbating in front of her, okay? See, now it's, we're getting into the nuances and it's just, it's hard. Can you condemn it? Can you? Can we cast dispersions? Let he who has not masturbated in front of coworkers, cast the first stone. Then she just gets pelted by a million stones. Yeah, this is obviously ridiculous. I just talked about the fruitlessness of pointing out double standard. So, I'm not going to have my own double standard by doing the same here. Now, we got double standards all over the place. It's like a inception situation with double standards. But you can't gloss over this. The most straightforward form of sexual harassment, I would think is what Jeffrey Tubin did. It's the most black and white sexual harassment that one can imagine. And I'd rather not imagine it. I have to underscore the point again, because there's some, there's some gaslighting going on here to use a favorite phrase of the left. There's some gaslighting going on when they talk about the Jeffrey Tubin thing, because they keep saying it was an accident. He didn't mean to. Well, what part of it was an accident? The part where he took off his pants, and I'm not going to go into all the details, but you know, that whole process, that was not an accident. I mean, what is the absence of a sort of masturbatory Tourette syndrome, where he just, he can't stop himself? No, so that part was purposeful. What part was on purposeful that he didn't know his camera was on? Okay, so that's the unpurposeful part. But the other purposeful part is he was doing this during a meeting with his coworkers. They were on the screen. I don't want to speculate. Okay, the last thing I want to do is, is try to walk a mile in Jeffrey Tubin's messy shoes and to understand exactly where he was coming from. But, there's no pun intended there. But however, it seems to me that he was doing this during a meeting with his coworkers, and they were up on the screen. So it seems like he was, I don't know, watching them while doing this, all of that was intentional. He just didn't want them to know he was doing it. And so because of that, the whole thing's an accident. This is like, if a guy, it's like, what if Jeffrey Tubin was outside of one of his coworkers window at night peering through the bushes? And then, and then, and Navarro would say, it was an accident. He didn't, he didn't know, he didn't mean to be caught. That's the distinction. The camera being on, that's him being caught. All right. I've said far too much. Now we're going to hear from a new sponsor, if we're excited about on the show, myphoto.com. After a tough year, people are together. Again, they're taking a lot of photos. In, in, in my case, in my family, it's, we've been taking a lot of photos all along. I don't really take the photos, but my wife is the photo taker. No matter what we're doing, she's always saying, we got to take the picture. Well, here's, here's the problem. You take a picture and then it's just on your phone and you forget about it, right? What you need to do is take that picture and make it physical. And that's what my photo is all about. It's awesome and it's easy to use. It takes literally two minutes to create a special product for your own wall or shelf or wherever. And then make great gifts for loved ones.

Okay, this from Big Mac says, Matt, would you rather eat a burger king or at the soup kitchen Jeffrey to been volunteers at? Well, I just said I wanted to move on. But I imagine the problem you'd have with Jeffrey to been serving you is is not dissimilar from the kind of problem. You might have being served at a burger king. So it's kind of a wash. Frederick Landslott says, Matt, can we get a tie-dye Tuesday? It's what the people want. No, and your band and nobody wants that except for you. You freak. Well, thanks for watching. Molly says, Matt, kids are being taught that slavery is okay, as long as it's through communism. Very good point. And you are correct about that. Other comments says, Matt, do you think the ghost of abuela will haunt AOC after abuela dies? Well, the last thing I want to do is think about such an eventuality. But what I will say is that I would, if I were, abuela in that scenario. Jay Moron says, you ever notice the people who drone on and on about slavery always leave out the part where we abolished it? Yeah, they leave it out or they especially leave out the little detail how the United States is abolished slavery quicker than almost any other country, right? We abolish slavery in about what, 90 years or so? Less than a century, we abolished it. A century from the United States forming as a country, you are from there to the abolition of slavery and you've got less than a century. Okay. Meanwhile, you've got other countries across the world who've that practice slavery for thousands of years. And some still do in effect. Yeah. Slavery is technically abolished and illegal at this point everywhere, although it's still practiced in a lot of places, if not legally. But it wasn't even abolished legally in some places until the last several decades. And those places are not Western countries, I have to tell you. Uh, Olliska says, I will not write more comments. I don't think Matt reads them. You're right. I don't read them at all. Uh, Olive says Matt, Matt Walsh's sarcasm is to hide the fact that he has a massive caring heart. No, no, it's not. And Reagan says, Matt was far too nice in understanding this episode. I almost believe he has feelings. What's going on here? So my brand has been damaged. These are all lies, by the way. There were several comments like this accusing me of being nice and caring yesterday. What, how, when did that, when was the nice and caring part? That's why I had to be even more aggressive and, uh, and, uh, you know, depressing this episode just to, just to kind of even things out again and maintain my reputation. Uh, and finally Mason says, it's funny that no one talks about how the Irish were oppressed. Well, Mason, that's not possible. I don't know what you mean. The Irish were oppressed. Irish aren't black. Are they? They're white, aren't they? You know, white people can't experience suppression. This is a critical race theory. Taught me that. So I don't know what, I don't know what you could possibly be talking about. After a year of lockdowns, it's become, I think fairly clear that our leaders want nothing more than to control us. Uh, I would know because if I was a tyrannical dictator, I do the exact same thing, except I would be controlling you for your own good. That's the difference, right? I don't know why that's exactly what all tyrants say. Okay. Well, um, but because I'm not, uh, I, I do enjoy our freedoms, which is why you need to pick up Ben Shapiro's new book, The Authoritarian Moment. Listen, if a theocratic fascist is telling you to pick up a book criticizing authoritarianism, then you must do it. I mean, you really must do it because I'm telling you to do it. So if you understand the threat this poses to our future, it's time to read up on the truth in order to stand up to the woke. The authoritarian moment is now available for pre-order at Amazon Barnes and Noble and any other major bookseller. I'll also tell you about something, something else exciting happening here at The Daily Wire. Um, we know that leftism turns men and women into creatures that resemble addicts of some sort, you know, blue hair, gender nonconforming, whatever it may be. This isn't, this is not the exciting part. I'll get that in a second. But thankfully some renounce it before that transfer name, that transformation fully takes place and sometimes can become permanent. Georgia Howl is one of those people. And now she has a new show at The Daily Wire called Office Hours where she interviews various experts about the ideological indoctrination of the left through the unique lens of a former member.

Now let's get to our daily cancellation. So we begin our daily cancellation today with an account on Twitter called astrologer six. In her bio, she describes herself as an inclusive astrologer, inclusive, and also an intimacy doula. Coincidentally, I have both of those titles listed on my resume as well. But I fear that she's making her fellow inclusive astrologers look bad with this tweet. She posted, quote, I finished a book about how modern dating is arguably unpaid sex work and woo, woo, woo. I believe the woos are meant to be went meant to signify approval. It must be some kind of technical astrologer term. I don't know. As for the rest, all I can say is that the word arguably is doing a whole lot of work in that sentence. She reveals in a follow up that the name of the book written by Mora Weigel is it's titled labor of love, the invention of dating. And as far as I could tell from my extensive research, which involved skimming a summary of the book for about 25 seconds, it does indeed make the case that the inclusive astrologer claims dating is nothing but unpaid prostitution. And this is not the only notable bit of prostitution related content on Twitter this week. I also want to mention this and then I'll respond to and cancel both. Naomi Sayers, a lawyer, though suspiciously enough, she fails to specify whether she's an inclusive lawyer. She tweeted this unpopular opinion. The best thing young people can do earlier in their careers is do sex work on the side because your early career prospects will be unstable, unpredictable, low pay, likely contract work and very much exploitative. The best thing, not an acceptable thing or an understandable thing. And that would be bad and wrong enough. The best thing she says. And you'll notice this is always the flight path of leftism. Right? First, they argue that some degenerate activity is tolerable. And they simply want you to tolerate it and put up with it and let people do what they want to do in the privacy of their own homes or their own CD motel rooms in this case. And then they say, you know, it's more than tolerable. It's a positive good. And then finally, they claim that it's more than a positive good. It's the best thing. It's the ideal thing. Normalization is never the final goal. Normalization is a step towards the goal. They don't want to make a bad thing merely normal. They want to make it laudable, virtuous. We may not be at that point yet with sex work, where at least we may not be at the point yet where most of society views quote, sex work that way. But especially with the advent of only fans and the continued proliferation of online pornography, we've probably reached the normalized phase at least. In fact, the first hint that they've succeeded in normalizing sex work is the fact that people call it sex work rather than prostitution. And by the way, when we say normalized, we don't just mean that a certain sin is normal in the sense that lots of people do it. I mean, in that sense, prostitution has been normal since time immemorial, but in all sin has been normal in that way in the sense that people do them. What we mean is normal in the sense that society doesn't look down on it, doesn't judge it, doesn't view it as especially dirty or degraded. And that's probably where we are with prostitution. And that's a problem for many reasons. But two of them are illustrated quite helpfully in the tweets already mentioned. First, as the inclusive astrologer, or at least the book she's reading says dating is unpaid sex work. That's the claim. And this is the kind of view that you find once once quote unquote sex work prostitution becomes more and more normalized, you find these kinds of things being equated. But saying that dating is unpaid sex work, it's like saying that parenting is unpaid babysitting or it's like saying that cooking a nice meal for your family is unpaid restaurant work or having a conversation with a friend is like being an unpaid podcast co-host. I don't know. It turns all forms of human exchange into business deals. It makes all relationships transactional. Naomi Sayers, the lawyer says that the best thing a young person can do is sell their bodies for money. And she says this is better than other career prospects because those other careers might be unstable and exploitative. Of course, the obvious irony is that prostitution is the very definition of exploitation. The people who wish to normalize prostitution will say, and this this argument is very common now. This is what Naomi Sayers are saying. We'll say that there's no difference between literally whoring yourself out and say working at McDonald's. But there's a very clear difference. When you work at McDonald's, you're being hired and paid to perform a task to do a certain thing. As a prostitute, you are the thing that is being done. You aren't selling your services or your skill set. You're selling your body itself. Your body is the product, the object, the inventory on the shelf. If you work at Old Navy, right, you're selling clothes. If you work as a prostitute, you're taking off your clothes and selling what's underneath. And what's underneath it is you, your body, yourself. The prostitute offers her body up as a glorified masturbatory aid, a breathing sex doll, essentially, to be exploited and used and then discarded by a stranger. There is a major difference here. It's the difference between being an employee and a slave. It's the difference between selling an object and being one. There are those who don't want you to notice the difference. They seek to elevate prostitution by degrading all other work. And this is always the method, right? Lift up what is dirty and wrong by pulling the whole world down to its level. We should definitely resist those kinds of attempts. And to those who are attempting it, we should say, altogether now, you're canceled. And we'll leave it there for today. Thanks for watching.
