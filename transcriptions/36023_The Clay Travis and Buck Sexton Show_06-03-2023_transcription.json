    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and bucksxton show podcast Welcome in clay Travis bucksxton show it is the monday edition of the program and we have got an absolute cornucopia of stories For all of you to experience with us encourage you as always you like the use of the word plant copia there SAT word right out of the gate mr. Clay I think it's important to educate illuminate and elucidate for all of our crew out there how Spectacular we are when it comes to word choice at times And we got a bunch of of word choices to dive into I'm saying this not pronunciation though apparently based on the emails we get I have never done any show and I've been doing shows for 20 years now of radio The number one thing that people email me about on this show is the pronunciation of words And it's like not words that are used every day It's random words that are said, you know, maybe once a week once a month It's unbelievable and I evidently I talked to ruecer alley about this and she was she said Rush used to talk about this all the time too One of the number one things he would get is pronunciation Emails and so I believe the staff is putting together a best of of rush reacting to All I don't know what it is about this audience Just absolute sticklers for the pronunciation of words. So we'll see if we can get them to write today Um, but the truck desantis cold war I think it's fair to say that because desantis is still an unannounced candidate For the 2024 republican presidency nomination it is going to be an absolute war Trump's still trying to go to men feels like desantis is going to announce around june when the 60 day Legislative session ends in the state of florida and then the donnie brook as I like to call it will officially be underway Between now and when the caulkuses begin in early january, which honestly is not that far away Particularly when you consider summer oftentimes everybody out there knows goes by very quickly and then you get into the holiday season before you know it and so This thing may well be decided by september october in terms of who's likely to vote how things are going to look in iowa Sonu new came out. I'm sure you saw this the governor of new hamster buck and basically said desantis is going to win New hamster if voting were going on right now That means iowa was a toss-up then we'll see what happens in south carolina with some particular unique Regional variety there because niki haley and tem scott may both be on the ballot in south carolina as what as well so This thing is underway But i think buck the continued fallout of the lab leak theory And everything that it has represented with the department of energy and the fbi both putting their full weight now behind the idea That covet came out of a chinese lab which you and me and anybody out there in our audience who mentioned for several years Oh, it was a far right wing conspiracy. It was racist in origin How dare anyone be able to mention it stories out now saying cnn Uh in particular jeff zucker there a diminutive leader Was demanding that no one at cnn even cover the idea of the covet lab leak because trump had said that he believed That's where it came from alongside of mike pumpayo and trump was right again on this and The body blows that are getting delivered to msnbc and cnn buck because their brand had been During the trump era were the truth tellers even though covet uh collusion lie with russia even though They have overwhelmingly those two networks i believe been the foremost purveyors of misinformation anywhere in the media ecosystem And a guy like russell bran who is really funny and uh, i i i don't know him at all i've never done any of his shows But he is a persuadable person who seems to be sane and i would tie it in buck with i'm seeing a tidal wave now Of people who are in the comic space who are just so fed up even chris rock over the weekend i watched his special There is a great deal of hate right now I would say in the entertainment comedy space over this ridiculous woke agenda that democrats are foisting out there And r what uh russell bran on bill mar show friday Just absolutely eviscerated and msnbc Contributor to his face. We got grabbed a cut of it. I think you guys will enjoy it here it is Do you want an example the ludicrous outrageous criticisms of joe rogan around ivermectin deliberately referring to his a horse medicine when they know it's an effective Madel turning on the tv saying if you take this vaccine you're not going to get it when it's clinically trial to try to respond to you have to listen Do you think you can improve america? Determinately and avowedly condemning fox news without acknowledging that you're participating in the same Game bickering about rich proper gandis network is the worst is not going to save a single american life Not improve the life of a single american child not going to approve america standing in the world and the world needs a strong america All right, so First of all we can unpack it It is it is the best thing that russell bran has done since he played al dis snow and forgetting sarah marshal Such a good movie A great a great date or with the with the wife movie to watch if you haven't seen it really really holds up pretty well Definitely not not for the kids. It's 18 plus, but it's a good movie really funny movie Um, so this is the best thing also he gets more attention than his ideas to do because he's going like this crazy accent His voice is up. He sounds all crazy and he's like oh, but we're just gonna speak really fast and talk about the corporations And okay fine He's a socialist from what I understand so I take everything he says with a grain of salt I would add two things in this because yes clay. I liked it too like I liked what he said to msnbc Of course, he's also he's hitting fox as well there. So let's not forget. It's not like he's Uh, you know, he's all of a sudden. He's not a conservative. He's not red pilled, but he's a guy who understands the position of the institutional left on covid specifically but on a range of issues. I think increasingly they're seeing on the transgender agenda as it pertains to Drag shows for small children can't defend it can't win. They're trying they're pulling out everything They all the stops clay. They're losing on that issue. They're losing because of state legislation They're losing because the work of some of our colleagues in right wing space. Okay So it's that he's recognizing that the left is indefensible on these issues and that is helpful for a man of the left to say But I also there's always this party and it says Where were these people two years ago when you and I were doing interviews and going on shows and saying this is crazy Where were these people when it mattered, you know, and so this is also why look I like that bill mar I would go on bill mar i've been on before you would go on bill mar it's one of the few places where you have Actual I wouldn't even say left right clashes, but you you do have some iconoclasm You do have some clash of of ideas and you know sacred cows sometimes get slaughtered on bill mar show fun Which is which is important, but I feel like for a lot of these individuals They were there cheering on this monster Until it became clear that the monster was completely insane Do you know what i'm saying like there are people on the left who are waking up now And i'm always caught between great the waters warm jump in for team sanity and Well, I mean are you still like a climate change lunatic and believe all the other insane stuff But you realize this is too much like stopping no vac joke of it from coming to the us open This summer as we talked about that is too much It's crazy. It's crazy and he can't come into indian wells for our listeners down in south florida who may be tennis fans Why I welcome it is We have to and this is a big part of of just reaching out to audience and trying to broaden the tent But there are still so many people out there who don't know the truth about covid There are still so many people out there who don't know the truth about russia collusion And I get that fox news gets attacked. I mean they're in the political space everybody's going to get Attacked in that respect. I can't speak For everybody that that has worked at fox. I mean I sold out kick to fox two years ago in the two years that I have been a contributor to fox news No one has ever told me anything about hey don't talk about this topic now I wasn't there during the the fallout of the of the 2020 election And all of the allegations surrounding what was said and what wasn't said and what did happen I've said for a long time. I believe the election was rigged by big tech big media In favor of democrats in joe biden. I don't think there's any doubt at all about that but Nobody has ever told me hey don't talk about this. You can't talk about this and so when I see cnn And jeff zucker it coming out now Oh jeff zucker just said we're not going to cover in any way with all of the resources Journalistically that cnn has the idea that there might have been a lab leak of covet from wuhan Because donald trump believes it happened that is not journalism And I think it's very important for people out there to understand that at many places in media Narrative trump's facts and buck what you and I try to do on this program I've come out and said like hey, I'll get some things wrong I'll adjust my opinion as the data changes one of the things that I got wrong back in march of 2020 I wish that I had not trusted the data that china put out about covet And tried to extrapolate from that what the impact would be in the united states And I went to my audience and I said look I whiffed on this And we didn't have a lot of data in march when the first numbers were coming out when china shared all those numbers I tried to look at it and analyze it from that perspective. I wish I hadn't done that It's the only thing i've ever said during covet that I wish I could go back and change But that's honest right like be honest with your audience. None of us are going to bat A thousand none of us are going to make every shot we take and you should be willing to adjust your opinion As facts change and be open-minded on all of these things You can't treat somebody as an honest person if they Won't admit and correct mistakes You can honesty is not I thought what I thought when I thought it when I thought it and I said it And I never go back and I never corrected on it I never address it. I've said one of my regrets is that I I really thought that for those who were at high risk The vaccines would probably for at least that variant that season Be be effective for those our parents to get them based on the data that was out there at the time I didn't think that it would be effectively worthless. I mean that yes I I knew that we shouldn't have mandates. I knew you and I didn't need it I knew that people that you know because I had already had it and I believe the natural immunity the whole time Didn't just discover that in the last couple of months like apparently the cdc and the nih have Um, but yeah, I thought it could I underestimated how much of a cluster the Fauciite regime could actually be like I I thought it was going to be You know a nine out of ten and awful and they actually turned the dial up to 11 for those of you who are spinal Tap fans and and I think that with jeff zucker and cnn I mean what you see is somebody who I mean trump what he was a have and trump was the white whale I mean nothing. Yes, nothing else mattered. There was no other consideration other than Mobilizing a democrat aligned cable news network to destroy Yes an individual also a movement, but it was deeply personal between trump and zucker They knew each other in the past they had worked with each other at nbc So you have to remember that too and until there is a full accounting for that Um until there's a full accounting you can't assume that these entities have any interest in even trying to get it right Because they're they're not being honest about what's happened up to this point And you know another thing that comes up now. I think a lot clay is people ask me They'll say you know do I think there was cheating and what cheating was there in 2020? I'll say oh, I'm I'm highly confident there was cheating. I can't say how much I can't say what necessarily can be proved But you know my gut instinct tells me and why why do I feel so free about sharing that even though it's not precise I'm not saying it's scientific because they spent four years saying that trump was a russian asset And that he stole the 2016 election So, you know, what's good for the goose is good for the gander like why is it that one side is able to get away with the most massive Obvious fraud and leveraging the federal government the fbi and the uh, d oj to do it But we're supposed to sit around all the time and just say what what the acceptable talking points are on election security The most secure election in all history No, I don't think we have to play the game By the rules of people who have shown us they have no honesty and no integrity to this day whatsoever I think that's well said Uh, we'll continue to break this down. Uh 800 282 282. You can always weigh in as well As we roll through the monday edition of the program in the meantime How many of you out there right now are nervous about food supply How many of you maybe didn't have power with all the storms that rolled through recently? I know a lot of people in tennessee a lot of people in michigan a lot of people all over the country Have been dealing with their power being out Do you have enough food to be able to take care of yourself? What about what's going on out in california? Have you seen some of the massive amounts of snowfall in the mountains of california right now? Many people have snow drifts taller than their houses What if you couldn't get out? Do you have food security in your home? We do here in the travis household three months thanks to my patriot supply each one of my kids my wife myself We all have three-month emergency food kits and when you purchase one of these you'll get 200 Worth of survival gear as a free bonus go to my patriot supply dot com to check it out this lasts for years It's a one-time insurance investment in your family's food security You'll leave it in the pantry it can last for years You don't have to worry about your family being taken care of three months worth of emergency food Rule of thumb buy one for each member of your household as I have done for my household We got five of them you can go to my patriot supply dot com and enjoy free shipping as well That's my patriot supply dot com They're here to shed light on the truth every day Clay Travis and buck sexton The larger problem with all of this is the inability to discuss Things that are within the realm of possibility without falling into absolutes and litmus testing each other for our political allegiances as it arose from that my bigger problem with that was I thought it was a pretty good bit that expressed kind of how I felt and the two things that came out of it were I'm racist against Asian people and how dare I align myselfs with the alt-right So there's john steward also talking about the lab leak thesis and how He got into trouble for saying the obvious which is the Wuhan institute of virology being a few miles away from the first cases of where this thing happened Seems to be an indicator of something. It's a big world out there You know it didn't break out in east hampton It happened next to the wuhan institute of virology And so again, I am Clay looking at this as The honesty is welcome. The timing of it though is not great Where where were these people who are now saying we should have free debate and open exchange of ideas and we should question assumptions and It's almost year three here. Right? Yeah, it's been a long time. Most people are cowards. That's one of the disappointing things to come out of covid Because if you run through all of the different things that had to happen You can just pick one example But even in my own neighborhood buck they put up crime scene tape around an outdoor playground to keep kids from going to it And I live in Williamson county, Tennessee as red of a county as exist in the country Yet in march of 2020 So many people in this entire country were cowards that even in a rock ribbed red part of the country Kids couldn't get on swings in My neighborhood and they put up Flipping crime tape around it now it didn't last very long But this was all madness and you and I were talking out about it then But we got vociferously attacked And I do welcome the fact that some people are now saying oh well this can never happen again But I think we have to ensure that that occurs and the only way to ensure that in my mind is with a true reckoning People we got wrong If you want a small business out there, you know the value of time Get refunds dot com does too. That's why they've made it easy no matter how busy you are to apply for the employee retention credit or e RC go to get refunds dot com to get started in in less than eight minutes See if your business qualifies for erc assistance your business may be eligible for a payroll tax refund of up to $26,000 per employee kept on payroll during covid-19 get refunds dot com has already helped clients claim over $3 billion in payroll tax refunds for the erc They may be able to help your business too. There's no upfront charge either They don't get paid until your business gets its refund many businesses believe they won't qualify based off incomplete or outdated information Don't let this opportunity pass you by because this payroll tax refund is only available for a limited time Go now get refunds dot com that website is get refunds dot com one more time Go check it out all the business owners out there go to get refunds dot com Welcome back in clay travis pucks sexton show we are rolling through the monday edition of the program So many different stories that are out there for us to catch up on And we've been talking about the fallout as everybody now tries to recognize oh wait a minute Yeah, we did get everything wrong on covid and Buck one of the stories that's coming out and I really let me just say this and we've been saying it for a long time I do believe That the next president of the united states presuming he is a republican Needs to open an investigation into dr. Fauci's testimony that he gave before congress over the past two years Because I think there's pretty clear evidence if you go back and look through what for instance fauci told rann paul Senator from kentucky who absolutely grilled him over many of these issues I think fauci purged himself in front of congress And one of the stories that's out there as the fallout of the covid lab leak becomes more pronounced buck is The idea that fauci Tried to cover all this up by making it seem like a scientific certainty that this could have never occurred And there have to be consequences. We went to break. I said there has to be a reckoning There that there needs to be I believe some people basically Duck walked frog walked however you say it and charged with crimes relating to covid And I think fauci is at the very top of that list now would it be hard to get a conviction? Certainly, but are you sending a message about what is acceptable in terms of trying to silence your critics In what should be a major issue of national debate? I also think all these people who got it right with a great barrington declaration And and you know you and I came out and said yeah, this is all reasonable. This is all rational There should be plot its rewards significant Uh attributes given to them for getting the biggest thing in their career 100 correct despite the consequences I don't trust doctors who still say that masks are an effective you shouldn't means of Stopping covid in any capacity. I don't trust them because they have bad judgment Their judgment even if they're brilliant. I don't care what their mcat score was. I don't care how long they've been in practice If their judgment is that flawed because of their political allegiance I don't trust their judgment on anything that has to do with health And this you can you can extrapolate this all the way up to the cdc You take this all the way up to the top right? You know fauci as we know was the director of nyad So he yeah, this is the perfect bureaucratic maneuver He had his own little kingdom that was an offshoot of a massive bloated bureaucracy with nih So that he wasn't really ever the head of either the cdc or the nih But got to act like he was the head of both because he had been around so long And and the vile little tyrant smurf was able to get his way with so many of these things But how can you trust this cdc in these organizations going forward? I mean the fact that the democrats are always pushing the cdc to do more studies on gun violence Um, here's the study lock up criminals gun violence is bad the end like what what do they really think is going to be accomplished But as we know it's putting a science hashtag science behind assault rifle ban, you know handgun ban the future universal registration, etc That's why they want to involve the scientists and this is what you saw all along Was that they use science as a political tool and in doing so they bastardized science in a way From which it may never really recover at least not in our lifetimes You know meaning the science or the people that are in charge of this that we're all supposed to trust and You know, I don't think it's an accident that we've entered this era of Fauci and the mask lack a lockdown fanatics On the one hand and you may have just seen clay. I mean this is this is uh in in your world Um, they've now decided that the usa powerlifting competition is going to allow athletes to compete in the women's division After losing a discrimination case Okay, everybody let's let's play a game. How many mds or or research phds in some kind of Biology related for how many of them are willing to come forward and say this is crazy very Very few And yet how many children in the third grade if you said who are stronger boys or girls would get that right? I mean unless they've gotten brainwashed already by the you know Woke propaganda, but if you just asked somebody who hadn't been told one way or the other in school They'd say boys are stronger than girls so, you know a a trans power lifter is now going to become the female powerlifting champion and again, this is because the fundamental lie here It's not about politeness. It's not about letting people live their lives as they see fit or any of that That's all fine. Be polite. Let people live their lives But they can't live their lives a certain way if That requires you to lie and you to change your life. That's a different thing This crosses over from don't hurt me. Don't take my stuff to oh no, you're actually hurting me too This is about other people as well. It's not just about the extreme narcissism and delusions that are at the heart of the trans agenda at some point tolerance becomes destruction and and I think this is important for people out there to recognize because Most people didn't really care about any trans related issues for decades, right? Somebody decides in 2004 they want to be a guy instead of a girl or vice versa and they go through that process What it becomes uh when it becomes a big deal is when you start demanding that I change my behavior in order to fit your lifestyle choices and I don't know that there's any more Perfect illustration of this occurring than sports and and to me the sports is kind of the canary in the coal mine here But the fastest woman in the history of womanhood is chakari richerson. I believe I got that right She is the fastest woman to ever live. She holds the fastest recorded time for any women. That's a really badass thing Congratulations to her every Boy who won a texas state high school championship is faster than the fastest woman who has ever run Bigger stronger faster is the rule for men compared to women now There are lots of super strong women But if you and I went into a Crossfit gym down in miami where you are or here in nashville where we are There might be a couple of women who are a lot stronger than you and me right that can that are in bitter better physical Condition that can deadlift more all those things more power to all those women But they're outliers by and large and the strongest men Are going to crush the strongest women So when you allow a man to go through all of male growth biology testosterone It's the lea thomas story all over again and then you allow them to compete for olympic metals What is happening is the erasure of female athletics? So so to bring this back. I mean the the science as in the harnessing of pseudo consensus among left wing Democrat aligned mds and phds on these issues Is such that not only do they go along with this and say things that they know to be untrue They demand that others in their profession at at a minimum Shut their mouths if not go along with it because right there is not an md in america There is not a gender expert in america who call into this show and explain how it is not just patently unfair and absurd to let men compete against women in powerlifting Of all things. This is completely insane And and you know you get to a point where you really have to start asking the even more extreme Questions you go beyond this you say why not trans age? Ism, you know, I clay I think i'm a third grader and I want to go compete against third graders in dodge ball And you know little third graders getting carted off because i'm headhunting and smacking them as hard as I can The face with the dodge ball too bad. I think i'm a third grader You wonder on what basis am I to be told if I really feel that way If i'm living my truth again, if I want to walk around and tell people on the third grader It's a free country. I can tell people that they might think i'm crazy But if I then want to compete against other people in the third grade That is the line and that is the line that the trans agenda has crossed Don't fall for this if it's so rare Uh, you know, why are you so focused on it if it's you know, it doesn't happen that often Why are you exaggerating it? What's the big deal? Why are you big at it? These are all the things they say When they push it everywhere. It's being pushed in every sport all over the country high school all the way up to the pros At some point in the next five to ten years if you have kids or grandkids There is going to be a trans kid in your daughter's sports It's going to happen Just is at some point in the next five to ten years doesn't matter where you are There is going to be this issue arising if it is allowed now I think a lot of states are passing these bills which make total sense which say You compete against the biology on your birth certificate I'm concerned that some left-wing states are going to respond to this by saying well Let's just take off sex on birth certificates, right? Like you think i'm crazy when I say that but I feel like that is probably Going to be a response. It's not it's not crazy to think that in california buck They'll just say well, why do we even need to know if it's a boy or a girl on the birth certificate? Let's let them decide later You know what what could be a more i can't believe this but yes, that's where we're headed what could be a more extreme form of Stateism of the all-powerful state that must be worshipped in place of god by people Then a state that insists that you not recognize the difference in men and women I mean, I just keep telling everybody if they can get you to admit that or rather to profess that to To celebrate that They can get you to say anything. Yes, and that's what you have to remember if you're going to say hey that 250-pound guy who's been you know a male his whole life. He's 25. Now he's 26. Now. He's a woman Yeah, he's a woman No different than the women that you've known your whole life if the state can force you to say that the state can force you to say Anything you have no basis for truth.

I think it came in in a couple of hours at CPAC the conservative political action conference over the weekend I couldn't make it this year. Clay also Had stuff to do in Nashville, but I I had a lot of friends there and they were telling me about it in real time We'll discuss some of what trump is trump is promising for his voters including that he will be their retribution. I believe was the phrase that got a lot of a lot of attention there. We'll discuss that plus it's so interesting the timing of this Governor ron desantis of florida is not running for president yet Maybe he won't run at all. I mean he has lost about 20 25 pounds By the way, clay since i've said that on this show other people have noticed this guy is in he's under a regimen right now Man. Oh, yeah, you could do you could do rocky montages of ron desantis if you were seeing what's going on because I assure you My man is watching his macros getting his steps in and doing some strength training I'm just putting it out there. You're not going to hear any meatball or you know heavy dee jokes about ron desantis Um, which is you know two things that people have called him in in the past, but um He's running around the country or going around the country for a book tour Including in california, which is interesting because it is not florida and it's quite far away And had some things to say about that state. So we've got some political heavyweights here Perhaps a midweight in the case of ron, but i'm just saying We've got some big names and politics. We're going to discuss in the next hour clay You have a quick update for us on a fact issue and then we want to talk chris rock. What is the fact check sir People are pointing out and i'll wear this one Uh flow joe florence griffett jointer has the fastest time In the women's hundred from back in like 1988. I forgot. I thought she had been eclipsed Point still stands texas boys state champions are all today faster than the fastest woman In the history of the world, but i got the fastest woman in the history of the world wrong Therefore want to get that correction props to flow joe from back in 1988. No one has yet broken that record I believe i'm not an expert in women's track and field, but the point is as we were saying earlier Male athletes even at a high school level are faster than the fastest woman who has ever lived According to recorded track time. All right now. I watched the whole chris rock special Over the weekend. I watched it close to live. It was a netflix live comedy event. I thought it was really pretty funny Um, and I think the opportunity here buck and i've been writing about this in my book Republicans should become the party of comedy Embrace jokes even jokes that make you cringe even jokes that make you uncomfortable Embrace the idea of jokes There's a huge opening here because most of what chris rock said was anti woke and the entire concept of his discussion his standup act Was selective outrage and he opened talking about people who will play michael jackson songs But won't play it play our kelly songs like who do you decide to cancel and not cancel? So now I tried to watch it with karae over the weekend and I got I watched the end because of the will smith commentary which i'd heard so much about Um, I couldn't get more than 15 minutes into it. Honestly, I'm not a like a I'm not a problem. I don't have a problem with salty language general. I just thought too much cursing too much shouting It's just not my thing. That's just not my style of comedy Um, but the fun the line about michael jackson r kelly was very funny because it is true Michael jackson's music is some of the best pop music ever recorded by most people's but Whereas you know r kelly really has one song that everybody remembers so and his point can argue our R kelly's been convicted michael jackson was never convicted, but it is selective outrage Here he is though and by the way he does use the b word just be prepared. It is in this clip play clip 12 well smith practices selective outrage Because everybody knows what the f*** happened everybody that really knows knows I had nothing to do with that I didn't have any entanglements His wife was f*** her son's friend. Okay Now She heard him way more than he heard me Okay, everybody call them all basically called his wife a friend and everybody call them Everybody and who's he hit me There you have it pretty funny that's pretty much the uh at the end he gets into some of that We're gonna get into Desantis trump biden by the way, you may not know this Biden says he was a hero of the civil rights movement as a student and you may not know it because It's not true. We'll talk about it coming up"
