    "text": " Today on the Matt Wall Show, the entire gender transition industry is built on lies. We'll reveal today the results of our week's long undercover investigation that exposes this fraud. You don't want to miss it. Also, an activist judge in Florida declares that gender identity is real. What does that mean and does he even know what it means? And also, Vivek Ramaswamy gives the best answer on Ukraine that any presidential candidate has given so far. In our daily cancellation, the artist formerly known as Ellen Page claims that she was viciously hate-crimed by a right-wing transphobic bigot in Hollywood where all transphobic bigots are known to hang out. We'll talk about all that today on the Matt Wall Show. Did you notice that big tech companies today are masquerading as private companies? Are we supposed to believe that a big tech wolf has now turned into our sweet grandma? Big tech literally feeds on your information by collecting and selling off your data. They can't stop themselves from looking at what you do online. That's why to protect myself against big tech's prying eyes, I use ExpressVPN. When using the ExpressVPN app on your computer or your phone, you're hiding your unique IP address. Websites can't use that address to find out your relocation or track what you do online. On top of that, ExpressVPN encrypts and reroutes 100% of your online activity so your internet provider, WiFi admin and hackers can't see it. Best part though is how easy it is to use. It just takes one click to protect all your devices. One ExpressVPN subscription covers up to five devices at the same time so you can protect your entire family too. So today's the day.

That's ExpressVPN.com slash walls to get protected ExpressVPN.com slash walls. One of the arguments you hear a lot in the debate over gender ideology across the political spectrum is that adults should be able to do what they want. This is the supposedly moderate position. People presidential candidates believe it. Millions of Americans believe it too. As long as you stay away from the kids, they tell you, then there's no problem. The moment you hit 18 years old, do what you want. Live your truth. It's not hard to see why that position is tempting for some people. Children obviously can't consent to life altering procedures including genital mutilation, incarceration, especially those. Adults on the other hand are able to consent to a lot of things. They can buy guns, they can vote, they can serve in the military. So if they want to pay a doctor to carve up their bodies, then what's the big deal? That's the argument you hear again and again. No one really means it though. And you know that no one means it because none of the people making that argument would use that same reasoning to justify, say, lobotomies. If you walked into a doctor's office today and asked him to drill a hole in your head and sever your prefrontal cortex in order to make you feel better about your life, he would say no. And if he did it, he would go to prison. No amount of informed consent, no matter how old you were, could possibly justify it. It's barbaric. Tens of thousands of people's lives were ruined by lobotomies. And everybody recognizes that now. Nobody's marching in defense of lobotomy affirming care. So if you defend these gruesome quote unquote gender affirming procedures on adults, you're not really saying that adults should be able to do what they want. You're saying that yes, people can change their sex if they want. We're conceding that these procedures, slicing up a woman's arm to make a fake penis, lapping off healthy breasts, grafting fake nipples onto patients, chest, et cetera, are medically reasonable. And in the absence of any kind of statistical data about positive long-term outcomes of these surgeries, you're trusting the doctors to follow an established standard of care. You're assuming that they're not going to just mutilate anyone who walks in the door without regard for what happens to these people afterwards. The problem is that the entire industry of gender affirming care is a scam. The whole thing. And we know that because we just spent weeks investigating the largest providers of so-called trans health care in the country. We went undercover at one of them. And what we found is that there are no real standards of care governing any of this. To be clear, there are standards of care quote unquote on paper and they're provided by the transgender activist group WPath. WPath standards are used by major hospitals in this country, including UCLA, UCSF, Mass General, just to name a few. How rigorous are these standards exactly? Well, after a 22-minute video call, the largest trans health care provider in the country, carefully following the WPath guidelines, approved one of my producers, Greg Ray, for an orchiectomy. That means testicle removal. Now, 22 minutes would be a record time to get approved for an orchiectomy if you had a real medical reason for it, like testicular cancer. It's insane to approve any serious procedure that quickly, having just met a patient in a video call for the first time. But that's what happened. And we recorded the whole call. At no point did anyone at this health care provider, which is called Plume, pushback in any way. They didn't suggest that maybe this was a rash course of action. They didn't verify any of the information Greg provided, including his fake name that he gave them. All Plume did was insist that he pay 150 bucks. If Greg did that, they promised to write him a medically sound letter in support of life-altering surgery. That letter, under the WPath standards, is required for anyone trying to get transgender surgery in the United States. You have to get one of these letters from a health care provider and then present it to your surgeon. And Plume rubber stamped Greg's letter in 22 minutes. And not all that time was spent discussing the surgery, by the way. Some of the conversation was about traffic and the weather. As I speak, we've uploaded footage of the call on Twitter. You can watch it there right now. In a moment, we'll show you parts of it. In this video called Greg, assume the name Chelsea Bussey. He didn't dress up as a woman. He didn't wear any women's clothing or makeup or any of that. He didn't go to party city and dye his hair blue. He just told them. He identified as a woman and that he was taking hormones prescribed by his father. Greg couldn't even pronounce the name of the surgery he wanted. He called it an orchidectomy. He claimed at one point that the surgery, that the reason he wanted the surgery is that it would speed up his non-existent transition, which the Plume nurse said didn't make any sense from a medical perspective, but none of that raised any red flags for Plume. The nurse told Greg she wanted to write him the strongest letter she could anyway. Watch. So you're currently on estrogen. You're taking six milligrams a day. Twice a day. Yeah, there's a drink. You got it. So you're taking what point five is that? Yeah. Okay. And then, I think it's just a thing that we can take a big history. All right. Okay, so let's kind of get into this a little bit. So you are seeking what surgery is what you're talking about. Things that are here, of course, you probably know, things that are irreversible when it comes to estrogen based therapy, this breast development and to sticky risk your image, right? But there's always a possibility for him to come back that may change the orchia. Once you stop, once you don't longer have your testes, you no longer have the ability for your teeth to convert to the H.T. if you don't have as much teeth, right? So hair, hair growth, facial and body hair may change without the orchia. That redistribution is affected by the estrogen. So you may have less of a change of that redistribution if you ever stop me, but you may, you may change of a whole. So it's kind of, it's kind of a, it kind of does have a benefit without the sprayer lockdown, but you still want to take, you still thought it would definitely want to take estrogen as a way of life. I'm not complaining about the daily pills just to be clear. I'm just saying, if it accelerates it, it makes things faster than that. Give me a little bit of history with your gender dysphoria. That may kind of help me. I want to make this letter as, as solid as possible to be like this orchia, if you definitely need it. I'll tell you, I'm happy to. So when I was, I was in school and I actually wrote a big essay for admission to a club about how I didn't feel like my biological sex went along with how I felt. And I told people that and they thought I was ridiculous. So because they thought I just, I just look like a guy. So they like, this is ridiculous. Now a couple of days after that discussion, as we document on Twitter, plume sent Greg a letter diagnosing him with significant and ongoing gender dysphoria. Therefore, plume said he was an appropriate candidate for orchiactomy. According to plume, testicle removal would help Greg make significant progress in alleviating his dysphoria. Now even after Greg followed up with text messages to plume, explaining that he doesn't have dysphoria, they didn't retract or amend that letter in any way. There's no excuse for that, obviously. Plume had multiple opportunities to tell the truth in their letter and they chose not to. In his intake form, Greg indicated he didn't have dysphoria for six months or more, didn't have it. That means under the current version of the DSM, he never should have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria in the first place. But plume never once asked Greg about this in his video interview. Instead they just said that he had dysphoria in the letter, which they intended to be used by a surgeon who would then carve up Greg's testicles. Why didn't plume amend the letter? Once they were made aware that Greg didn't have dysphoria. As plume's nurse explained, in order for the surgery to be paid for, quote unquote, the diagnosis would need to remain. In other words, insurance companies won't pay for the operation unless the letter contains a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. So they're going to put that diagnosis in there regardless. That's why plume uses templates that include the gender dysphoria diagnostic code. It appears very much so that they plug whatever information patients feed them into this generic template whether or not those patients actually have the diagnosis. The templates are provided by W-Path, by the way, and plume admitted that to us. It's not hard to conclude that this operation is fraudulent, but what do insurers think of it? What does Ettna and United Health think of it? What's their position on paying for surgeries based on cooked up diagnostic codes? What about Cygna? We understand those insurance companies work directly with plume. What about David Sachs, whose venture capital firm is one of the many that's funding plume? What are his thoughts on this? So you're aware this is happening? Those are good questions. But the problem is much bigger than plume. That's what you have to understand. They're far from the only ones doing this. Folks, F-O-L-X, for example, is a major competitor of plume. They're in almost every state in the country. They're also extremely well-funded by venture capitalists. Folks like plume also sells letters that authorize surgeries under the W-Path guidelines. On their website, folks admits, and I'm quoting, it's quite possible that the information in a letter may not be specific to you. For example, they may use a gender dysphoria diagnosis, but you really do not have dysphoria. You may not fit this diagnostic code exactly, but in some cases, the code is needed in order for insurers to pay for the surgery. Now we reached out to folks to ask them about this, and they confirmed that a diagnosis, which they put in scare quotes, was necessary in order for insurance companies to pay out. So that's why they put it in there. Again, that's probably news to the insurance companies, but the bigger issue, of course, is what's happening to the patients who are mutilated as part of this process. It's not just plume and folks who are authorizing surgeries like this. There's a whole network of doctors who crank out these letters. It's called the Gender Affirmative Letter Access Project, or Gallup. Think of the lives that these doctors and these companies are destroying for profit. Listen, if they will approve Greg for castration in 22 minutes, after he said he doesn't have dysphoria, they will approve anyone. I mean, anyone. Many of the luminaries in the field will admit that, by the way. On Twitter, we highlighted this training session from the Juniper Center, which is one of the largest gender therapy practices in the Chicagoland area. I want you to watch as the licensed clinical social worker named Eric Groener explains that she'll rubber stamp whatever letter patients want. She says she'll even authorize a suicidal patient for surgery because she's not a gatekeeper. In fact, Groener says that if her patient is suicidal, that would make the case even stronger for surgery. Listen to this. Any psych history that might be helpful to showing the necessity. If let's say a client has a psych history that includes suicidal ideation or a suicide attempt, and you can connect it to the gender dysphoria, that actually can be a positive persuasive essay piece. I'll talk about that in a little bit because you can show what this is so necessary. This is how this is impacting this person's life, and this is why this procedure is necessary and needed. I have found that when I frame it in a, we're going to use this as a persuasive essay, and we're going to really stick it to them, there's a little bit more fun with it in the way we even use language. I found that to be helpful with clients. Who's asking us to write these letters? Sometimes we're being asked by surgeons or physicians, but in reality, it's really for the insurance companies. That's what the letters are really for, and I think that's important for us to keep in mind. We have to use the DSM in our letters for insurance companies. So I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this, as you all can tell, I'm not like the biggest DSM fan. I just think it's important to highlight because of this requirement. This is something I'll explain to the client. I'll talk about your insurance company is saying as a requirement for this letter for the surgery that you have to have this diagnosis, and we'll talk about that. Knowing that this American Psychological Association or DSM, there's this history of pathologizing and categorizing queer people as sort of sexual deviance, there is that minimal trust. So what I talk about is that we're using the diagnosis to ensure that clients get that necessary treatment. So these are letters that are necessary to approve life-altering mutilation procedures and the people responsible for the letters, in this case, this woman describing them as persuasive essays that she has fun with. Now if you're defending gender affirming care, quote unquote, for adults, this is what you're supporting. You are saying that it's reasonable for medical professionals to listen to a suicidal patient who isn't thinking clearly and approve them for surgical castration within minutes. You're saying there should be no barriers to this kind of mutilation whatsoever. At that point, why not bring back lobotomies? What's the serious principle to argument against them? No serious person can defend this industry. It's completely corrupted at every level. It's not just targeting children, although it's certainly doing that as well. The underlying claims and promises of the entire gender affirming industry are lies, and they are lies propped up by even more lies as we just showed you. And we'll have much more on WPath soon, by the way, and how they became so prominent in this field. It's a truly disturbing story. Their supposedly rigorous standards of care are purpose-built to be manipulated as we've now revealed. A lot more on that. The practical effect of these WPath standards isn't to protect patients. Instead, the WPath standards protect doctors who butcher their patients. These doctors understand that they need to follow some kind of standard of care, quote unquote, or else they'll eventually get sued into the ground for malpractice by the patients they're disfiguring. So medical providers point to the WPath standards and say, look, we follow the standards. These gruesome surgeries are in fact legitimate medical care. Now it's time to put an end to this. Insurance companies should cut off these providers. Investors should stop funding this barbarism. At the political level, we need laws so that any doctor who mutilates patients or lies to insurance companies goes to prison, regardless of the patient's age. Florida recently passed a law outlawing, among other things, trans telehealth services that require in-person visits for most of these procedures. That's a start, which is why the media and trans activists are furious about it. They're probably going to sue to block that portion of law, just like they blocked the part of the law outlying child castration yesterday. But once people see the truth about what's happening, the radical gender activists won't win that fight. That's why we published our investigation today. The truth is obvious and undeniable. Now that the standards of care have been exposed for what they are, there's nothing to stop a flood of lawsuits that could shut down these butchers. We saw it in the UK with Tavistock. If something like that happens here, it could save tens of thousands of lives. That's why this investigation is just one part of what we have planned for Pride Month. We're going to expose the full extent of the depravity that you're told and insisted that you must believe is medically legitimate. We're going to show you the truth behind all the euphemisms. We're going to reveal how exactly activists have managed to hijack the medical profession so they can mutilate patients for profit. And this is just the beginning.

A federal judge on Tuesday concluded, gender identity is real and a ruling that partially strikes down Florida's new law banning doctors from prescribing purity blockers and cross-exformants to minors, which we just mentioned this ruling briefly in the monologue. Judge Robert Hinkle issued a preliminary injunction against Senate bill 254, which also criminalizes permanent mutilating surgical procedures and mandates that a healthcare predictioners license be terminated if they violate the law. Hinkle wrote in a 44-page ruling, the elephant in the room should be noted at the outset, gender identity is real. The record makes this clear. Despite the defense admissions, there are those who believe that cisgender individuals properly adhere to their natal sex and that transgender individuals have inappropriately chosen a contrary gender identity male or female, just as one might choose to read whether to read Shakespeare aggression. Hinkle continued. Hinkle's ruling centered around two 11-year-old girls and one 8-year-old boy whose parents filed a lawsuit against the state's surgeon general arguing that banning this stuff, the puberty blockers and cross-exformants, violates the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. That's really interesting and horrifying. 11-year-old girl, 8-year-old. But at the same time, we're told that they're not doing these things to children that young. Well, yeah, well, parents of an 8-year-old sued so they'd be able to mutilate their child and a judge agreed with them. Did they do that because this never happens? So this is just a flat-out activist judge, trans activist judge. This judge has a long history of judicial activism, siding with leftists on spurious grounds, to say the least. In this case, making no effort to hide it, using made-up nonsense terms like cisgender in his legal opinion, declaring that gender identity is real, which is a statement that means nothing. What do you mean gender identity is real? What do you mean? Yes, it's real in the sense that it's really a concept that people talk about and that was invented. So it's a real idea that people have. It's a real term. It's like a word that exists as a term, but it's also a really incoherent and useless idea. And it's not an idea that has any kind of that is reflected in physical reality. And that's why if you read this opinion, the judge is not going to be able to, now he can make statements, he can make assertions, gender identity is real, it's real. That's what they're constantly saying. This is real, it's real. When you say, well, okay, it's real, what is it then? What do you mean? What is it? What is it exactly? Well, they can't explain that. So let's not make any mistake about this. We focus so much and rightly so on the what is a woman question. But let's not be confused about this and believe that the word woman is the only term related to this issue that they can't define. Whatever that they can't define any other term either. Okay. And this is in a very literal sense, all of the terms that they use in relation to this issue, all of them are nonsensical and they can't define any of them. So when they talk about gender identity, gender expression, they use a phrase, a term like trans woman. And you try to get them to explain what exactly all of that is. It immediately falls apart into total nonsense. They can't do it. All they can do is they can assert it. They can't explain it. And now we have this from a judge. I also wanted to mention this. This is not a story yet, not a headline yet, but it will be. We got an email from some reporters at Rolling Stone. And my team got an email from reporters at Rolling Stone. And this is an email from someone named Nikki McCann Ramirez. And when they sent me this email, I recognized that name. I wasn't sure where I recognized it from. And I looked it up and okay, sure enough, Nikki McCann Ramirez used to be a shill over at media matters. And then she left media matters at some point and now is a shill for Rolling Stone. So it's like the media matters, obviously, far left activist group. They Rolling Stone brings her over as a reporter. She is now a journalist. Here's the email because this is kind of funny. And this also shows you this is how these people operate, okay? And any time, like any time you read a hit piece about someone, a conservative in one of these corporate media outlets. And it'll always say something like, we reached out to so and so, but didn't get a comment. And they put that in there and then it's supposed to make it look like, oh, the person's hiding. They don't want to talk about it. You really got them this time. Well if you want to know why there's no comment, it's because when they reach out, this is what it sounds like. Here's the email. My name is Nikki McCann Ramirez and I'm a politics reporter with Rolling Stone. We're reaching out because my colleague E.J. Dix and I are working on a piece about right-wing influencers increasingly focused on posting transphobic content. And we're citing Mr. Matt Walsh as an example. As we have noticed, he has centered much of his content around transgender individuals in the past several years. Would he like to provide comment regarding why he has made this topic an area of focus and what initially drew his attention to it? Please let us know by tomorrow EOD if Mr. Walsh would like to add anything to our piece. That's so generous of you. Hey, we're about to publish a hit piece. There's zero chance of it being objective or anything. And we don't care about Mr. Walsh's perspective in the least. We're going to call him a transphobe. It's an article all about how he's a transphobic bigot. Would he like to contribute to his own hit piece? I mean, never mind the fact that, and they haven't published the article yet, but I'm going to assume that they're not going to put any disclaimer on the article noting that the journalist quote unquote involved in this article used to work at media matters, are far left ideologues and are on the record personally hating the people they're reporting on. They're not going to, there's going to be no disclaimer, no qualifications there. That won't be mentioned. Well, I did offer a response on Twitter anyway. And I said, and this goes in general to any media outlet that wants to publish a hit piece on me. And you're welcome to do it. I'm always happy for all the coverage. If you want me to contribute to it and you want my comment, I'm also happy to provide comment if you can first answer my question that I've been asking, which is, if you can provide a definition of the word woman, then I will give you a comment. So pretty simple. That's the trade. And that's what I would say to you, Nicky, McCann, Ramirez, just get, you can email me, you can put it on Twitter, you can message it, everyone to do it. And me, your definition of the word woman, and then I'll send you a comment. It's fair trade. We'll see. We'll see if they take me up on the offer. Speaking of far left organizations, the human rights campaign put out a press release yesterday and it got a lot of coverage, as expected. Here's the headline of the press release. For the first time ever, human rights campaign officially declares state of emergency for LGBTQ plus Americans issues national warning and guidebook to ensure safety for LGBTQ residents and travelers. It says today, the human rights campaign, the nation's largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer civil rights organization officially declared a state of emergency for LGBTQ plus people in the United States for the first time in its more than 40 year history, following an unprecedented, dangerous spike in anti LGBTQ plus legislative assaults, sweeping state houses this year. State of emergency, because some people disagree with you. A state of emergency because some people, there are states where you're not allowed to mutilate children anymore, which is absurd obviously, but also, this is where we are now where these leftist activist groups think that they can declare a state of emergency. Okay, so, okay, you know what, I declare one too. I'm also declaring a state of emergency. State of emergency because of all the, we have reached critical capacity with idiots, like those who work at the human rights campaign, a media matters enrolling stone. Due to the just the sheer weight of all of this idiocy, it's threatening to break the idiot ban and we're all going to be drowned in it. And so I am also right now today declaring a state of emergency because that's apparently how it worked. Anyone can declare a state of emergency. Now, I laugh about it because I said, well, of course, they're not a government organization, so they can't declare a state of emergency. But in reality, they basically function like one. So maybe it's not a surprise that they think that they can make a declaration like this. Because the human rights campaign, it's a far left activist group, but they essentially operate like a quasi governmental agency. And they've been given that kind of power and that kind of authority so that now they think they can declare states of emergency. And we might get to the point where that actually does have some sort of weight behind it. All right, moving on to this, Vivek Ramaswami a couple of days ago, I wanted to play this clip. He was asked about the situation in Ukraine and he gave his answer for how to handle it. And of all the presidential candidates, I'm not sure I've seen anyone give a better answer than this. Let's listen. Let's talk about Ukraine. You said in a speech in New Hampshire on Friday that you would not spend another dime of American money on a war that does not affect our interests. You don't think the possibility of Russia taking over Ukraine is not, is in our interests? I don't think that's a top foreign policy priority. But I did also in that same speech, I didn't know if I was our top priority. No, I want to stick to this for a minute. You do not believe that Russia taking over Ukraine would be bad for our national interests. I do not think it is a top foreign policy priority for us. I don't think it is preferable for Russia to be able to invade a sovereign country that is its neighbor. But I think the job of the US president is to look after American interests. And what I think the number one threat to the US military is right now, our top military threat, is the Sino-Russian alliance. I think that by fighting further in Russia, by further arming Ukraine, we are driving Russia into China's hands. And that Sino-Russian alliance is the top threat we faced. And what I've said is I would end this war in return for pulling Putin out of that treaty with China. How do you do this? And it tells Vladimir Putin what to do. That has not worked yet. And you said you would want to give him the donbas. That will be rewarding Putin, wouldn't it? I don't trust Putin, but I do trust Putin to follow his self-interest. I don't think he enjoys being the little brother in the relationship with Xi Jinping. And so what I think we need to do is end the Ukraine war on peaceful terms that yes, do make some major concessions to Russia, including freezing the current lines of control in a Korean war style promise disagree. And Ukraine really wouldn't want to do. Which Ukraine wouldn't want to do. And also a permanent commitment not to allow Ukraine to enter NATO. But in return, Russia has to leave its treaty and its joint military agreement with China. That better advances American interests and actually further deters China from going after Taiwan. I mean, we've heard a lot. I mean, way too much about Ukraine, including from all the presidential candidates on both sides. But I don't think we've heard anything as thorough as that. At least this is someone who's like engaging with the issue and actually trying to come up with what could be a practical solution. What we usually get on Ukraine and really every other issue, just a bunch of platitudes and assertions and all of that. But no one is saying, okay, well, here's the issue. Here's how we solve it. One, two, three. Very rarely do we get that from politicians generally, of course, but especially on this, which I appreciate. And then of course you hear the interviewer there shocked and appalled and said, well, that makes some major concessions to Russia. And so what? Yeah, if you want to have peace, that's what is involved in having peace. You do make concessions. Daniel, you're giving away peace, pieces of Ukraine to Russia. So who cares? Who cares? Well, I don't care. It doesn't affect my family. It doesn't affect my country. Make concessions to Russia. Ukraine's not happy about it, but why should we care? You can't explain it. Why should we care whether Ukraine is happy? What we do care about is the potential for World War, which they're the ones who have been telling us that that's where this could lead. So we do care about that. And that is something that affects us greatly. But we talk about America first. I mean, this is what America first sounds like. It's like, let's come up with a solution that will protect our interests or putting our interests first because we don't expect other countries to do that. That's the point. If you as a nation are not going to put your own interests first, then no one else will. That just means your interests aren't being represented. As a nation, either you represent your own interests and you represent them strongly and unwaveringly, or they won't be represented at all in the world. And that's all that America first really means. It's really quite simple, I think. Here's another clip that's been going around. Alexandra Keza Cortez went on a rant a couple of days ago about how her faith leads her to support the mutilation of kids and other atrocities. Let's listen to that. I know. And it is part of my faith that all people are holy. And all people are sacred, unconditionally. And that is what makes faith sometimes. That's what prompts us to transform because it is unconditional. It's not about that it is up to us to love parts of people. We love all people. There is nothing holy about rejecting medical care of people, no matter who they are on the grounds of what their identity is. There is nothing holy about turning someone away from a hospital. There's nothing holy about rejecting a child from a family. There's nothing holy about writing discrimination into the law. And I am tired of communities of being of faith, being weaponized and being mischaracterized because the only time religious freedom is invoked is in the name of bigotry and discrimination. I'm tired of it. It is not up to us. It is not up to us to deny medical care. It is up to us to feed the hungry, to clothe the poor, to protect children and to love all people as ourselves. Absolutely on that last but anyway, it is up to us to protect children, including protecting them from being sterilized and castrated, you freak, you disgusting monster. I agree that we should never reject medical care at anyone. If somebody needs medical care, they need to get medical care. There should never be any laws or should there be any law that would prohibit anyone from getting medical care. However, castrated and sterilizing people, especially kids but really anybody, is not medical care. It is not care and there is nothing medical going on here. Medicine is about healing and treating and curing. And so that is not medical care. Also, and I agree with one of the things she said, which she says that her faith and her religion leads her to all these conclusions. I totally believe that. Her faith in leftism and the religion of leftism, which is Satanism, which is indistinguishable from Satan, it is the worship of the self. And so yes, her faith, that faith has led her to all these conclusions. She says all people are holy, which is nonsense. Okay. That's not true. And she doesn't believe that. All people are holy really. So Hitler was holy. Holy Hitler, Saint Hitler. Is that what you're saying? All people are holy. Is that, is that, is that, you go up to any, go to any prison, find any child molester in a prison and you're going to say that that's a holy person? Maybe you would. Now, all people are not holy. However, all life is sacred because all life was created by God, is given to us by God. And so therefore it is a sacred thing that we should cherish. But she doesn't believe that either, obviously, because she believes in abortion up until the moment of birth and probably afterwards. But she could say, all life is sacred. Well at the same time, applauding as a child, five seconds from birth is dismemberg or has his brain sucked out of his head. That's how you treat something that's sacred, AOC. You demented weirdo. You, you sociopath. I mean, that's what these people are. That's, you know, we laugh at AOC for being a moron and we should. But let's also keep in mind these are truly hideously monstrous evil people. When you consider what they are doing and what they're advocating for and trying to facilitate and fund, I mean, it's just, it's the modern Democrat party is responsible for evil that is like unprecedented in human history. Some of this stuff that they're doing. And let's always keep that in mind. Speaking of demented freaks, finally, is from Fox Sam Britain, the embattled former senior department of energy official was arrested as a fugitive from justice by Maryland police late Wednesday, according to county records, interviewed by Fox News Digital. Britain was taken into custody in Rockville. A spokesperson for the Mitch Paulton Washington Airport Authority, which is the lead law enforcement agency for both Washington DC area airports, said that the arrest was related to the theft of airport luggage, which is the third such criminal case involving Britain. And I said this is from Fox News. Frankly, I'm a little surprised that Fox News is running this article critical of Sam Britain during Pride Month of all time because we know that Fox News is a big, you know, really, really believes in Pride Month and celebrates it. So that's a little bit interesting. But the story is that we have a third case now. There's a third case of Sam Britain stealing a woman's luggage. And you know, I love this whole story because it's hilarious and it's also embarrassing for the Biden administration if they were capable of being embarrassed. But I also like it because it exposes the absurdity of the idea and idea that really needs to be exposed, which is that somehow a person's personal life, you know, their proclivities, their fetishes that they engage in, all that stuff that somehow that's irrelevant to the rest of them and that we can't make any broader judgments about a person and about their character just based on their sexual interests were told. But of course you can. I mean, of course you can. It was guaranteed based on this guy's sexual proclivities and his personal life guaranteed that he would be involved in all kinds of weird and disturbing and probably illegal behavior. Nobody is surprised by this. That's why the first time you heard about him stealing luggage, even though it's such a bizarre crime to commit, everyone heard that and you thought, well, okay, that makes sense for him. Sure. Yeah, I guess, you know, if someone's going to do something like that, I guess it'd be that guy. Don't judge a book by its cover. When the cover is a naked guy in bondage gear with a dog mask on and a dog leash, yeah, you should probably judge it. In fact, that's all you need. You don't need to know anything else about them. Every single thing you need to know is contained right there and you can make all the judgments in the world about them just based on them. Let's get to the comment section.

I went to the comments today and every single comment has to do with the Alien story, which is just how it worked out because all that's the thing that the audience cares the most about either because of that or because I cherry picked and looked for only the Alien related comments. Who knows? I can confirm nor deny either way. But there's one comment says, I used to believe in aliens until the government started openly acknowledging their existence. And I hear this a lot, this claim, but if that's how you're making these judgments and I don't really blame them, that is a healthy instinct to have. At this point, where the government officially declares something and so you're automatically skeptical, it's a very healthy attitude to have, absolutely. But then you should be interested to know that the government has not officially declared any of this. And in fact, an official capacity has still denied it. The Pentagon put out a statement yesterday denying what that whistleblower said. So these are whistleblowers. These are people going to the media, going to the public on their own with this information. The government has gotten a little bit more open, I suppose, about this slightly less dismissive than they have been in the past. But I don't think that that's a decision that they made ahead of time. I think it's just like they don't have a choice. The information's getting out there. It's the internet, the age of the internet. Everyone can see the stuff, they can see the videos. And it's way past the point where they can say, oh, it was a weather balloon or a swamp gas in the atmosphere or whatever. We're way past that. And so they have no choice but to at least acknowledge to a certain extent some of this. And I think that's what's happening. Albino Garcia says two possibilities exist. Either we are alone in the universe or we are not and both are equally terrifying. Arthur C. Clarke. Yeah, I've heard that quote before. And I really disagree with it. I think that I think the former possibility is certainly more terrifying, at least more depressing. You know, to me, and this is not why I've come to the conclusion I have on this topic, but you know, the idea of a vast, endless universe that spans gazillions and gazillions of miles with billions of galaxies in it, and that it's completely empty except for us alone on this one little rock spinning around one, you know, mid-sized star in a nondescript solar system and, you know, some backwater of the galaxy, like that we are alone completely. And it can still be the case. I'm not saying it's 100% that we're not, but to me, I find that certainly a lot more depressing. The idea that we're not alone, I don't think that's terrifying at all. Bee Yen says, I love how the human race has become so jaded that the potential discovery of extraterrestrial life doesn't even phase us as a species. And that is what is most terrifying at all. That's the most terrifying thing, is that this doesn't, like we talked about yesterday, that this doesn't even register. People have already moved on from it. And I really think, and I think the assumption is that, well, each new revelation is just not compelling enough, it's not convincing enough. No, I, honest to God, it's not even a joke anymore. I think that we, that a UFO could actually just land in full view of everyone. And there could be cameras live streaming it, and the aliens could get off their ships and say, hi, we're aliens or whatever they would say. Probably not that. But that could happen. And it would trend for maybe a day and a half. And then people will be arguing about something else. And says, I can't speak for everyone, but ultimately my don't care is that this has been a thing for as long as I've lived. There's always a whistleblower, some new big deal story, some top clearance person saying this. My personal stance is I'll believe it when I see it. Until then, I don't care to waste mental energy and time listening to rumors that have yet to be shown is anything but rumors. I hope it's real. Would be so cool to have all this released. So if this guy's telling the truth and it makes a difference with the government opening up, then great. But until then, the story is just noise. And that probably explains why most of us don't really care. It's not because we think it hurts our faith. It doesn't. We classify this with Bigfoot and Chupacabra would be cool to see it if we prove it. But until then, it's just a story and possibly a fiction. Well, even if I'll, like, isn't it at least interesting though? That's what I don't understand. No matter how you, where you fall on the issue, whether you're skeptical or not or you rule out the possibility or whatever it is, how can you not at least find it interesting? And you say that it's just noise and like, okay, but we live in a culture that it's nothing but noise all the time. And people are talking about things that are incredibly uninteresting all the time that dominate people's attention. Like just today, for example, the big, if you go on social media, the big story is that the CEO of or the president of CNN is stepping down. Chris Licht is stepping down. That's the big story people are talking about. It's like, who cares? Who cares? I can't make myself care about that kind of story who's in charge of CNN. Who gives a damn? It's like there's nothing less interesting than that. And yet that gets more attention than a whistleblower from, you know, with classified information coming out and saying we have space aliens in our possession that crash later on Earth. So yeah, there's a lot of noise. That's true. But even if this is just noise, isn't it at least much more interesting noise than a lot of the other noise that people will talk about? Finally, Anthony says, I honestly could listen to Matt Walsh every day talk about aliens. Well, Anthony, you feel that way? I feel that way. I can listen to myself talk about it. We may be alone in that, but that's okay. It's us against the crowd. And no matter how boring this is to the audience, my solemn pledge is that I will continue to talk about it, alienating more and more people every day. It will all be worth it in the end, I think. Probably not. If you're looking for something interesting to watch, check out our series, What We Saw hosted by Storyteller Bill Whittle. Season one is focused on Apollo 11 and now season two of What We Saw is in full swing. In episode 13, President Nixon's visit to China introduces a three power dynamic, but the Watergate scandal undermines his administration and diminishes American morale. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan further exposes American weakness. In this context, an older president brings renewed optimism, youthful vigor and a plan to end the Cold War and achieve victory after four decades of stalemate. Bill makes you feel like you're there witnessing history. Here's this amazing story in this week's episode of Cold War. All episodes of Cold War are now available to stream, but you have to be a daily wire plus member to see it. So go to dailywire.com slash Cold War to start watching. Now let's get to our daily cancellation. A few weeks ago, the writers in Hollywood went on strike. And for the most part, as a member of the audience, you can't really tell the difference. Most movie studios generate their films using AI chatbots anyway, I assume. Superhero movies don't have any writers at all since every film is exactly the same as every other film. One guy wrote a superhero movie 45 years ago and every other one has just been a version of that one. Overall, the writers are obsolete in Hollywood. It's like if I told you that the master carpenter at your local Ikea store was going on strike. Would make sense because Ikea doesn't need carpenters. Their mass-produced junk is made to look like all the other mass-produced junk. And that's how Hollywood has operated for a long time. There have been rare occasions recently where you can still really feel the absence of the writers. Times when Hollywood has come out with something that obviously needed to be workshopped in the writer's room for a little bit while longer. And here is one such example. Ellen Page, the actress who now calls herself Elliot Page and identifies as a man, has just revealed an alleged hate crime that she experienced last year. She didn't tell us about this event until right now, right when she has a book coming out, which the timing I'm sure is a coincidence. An article in an interview in the LA Times recounts this terrible experience, reading now quote, and yet here downstairs at his Sunset Strip Hotel. He is less than a mile from the spot where a man on the street threatened to assault him just last year. As he describes in his book, Page, who lives in New York, was standing at the corner of Sunset and Las Sienega. That's right. He's bringing a quick walk to the Pink Dot convenience store when a stranger approached him. I'm going to effing gay bash you, gay slur, the man threatened, terrified. Page began running toward Pink Dot where employees ushered him inside. On the other side of the door of the man yelled, this is why I need a gun. Quote, now when I'm in Los Angeles, I don't feel comfortable like I used to going for walks. Page says, yes, as a right wing bigot myself, I can attest that this is exactly how we talk. I'm going to gay bash you. I swear I'm going to commit homophobia against you. Why I ought to hate crime you hate crime. You to death. You hear me? You're about to get genocide in pal. These are the kinds of things we say in pages, fever, imagination anyway. At least now we know why Page infamously took Jesse Smollett's story so seriously. In fact, let's go back and just for fun, relive that moment again. Watch. I think the thing we need to know, and I hope my show, Gakeshan, did this in terms of connecting the dots, in terms of what happened the other day to Jesse. I don't know him personally. I sent all of my love. Connect the dots. This is what happens. If you are in a position of power and you hate people and you want to cause suffering to them, you go through the trouble. You spend your career trying to cause suffering. What do you think is going to happen? Kids are going to be abused and they're going to kill themselves and people are going to be beaten on the street. I have traveled the world and I have met the most marginalized people you could meet. I am lucky to have this time and the privilege to say this. This needs to stop. If a media that's saying it's a debate whether or not what just happened to Jesse Smalllett is a hate crime, it's absurd. This is not a debate. I will say that Stephen Colbert's late night show has been on the air for years now and the one good thing about that moment is it's the one time that his show has actually been funny. But it isn't a debate. You heard it from her. Jesse Smollett was assaulted by two Trump supporters in MAGA hats in Chicago at 2am in February and she was accosted by a transphobic right winger in Hollywood where transphobic right wingers are of course known to congregate. You must believe all this without question or you are a bigot. It doesn't work. To which we all respond, well, okay, I guess we're bigots then because this is nonsense. Nobody uses the phrase I'm going to gay bash you and anyone who would use the phrase if such a person exists isn't hanging out in Los Angeles and probably wouldn't even know who this woman is if she passed by on the street. Besides, if someone really was screaming anti-gay slurs and making physical threats against a prominent Hollywood actress in broad daylight in LA in front of witnesses, you'd think we would have heard about it by now, you know, and you'd think the police would have gotten involved given that making physical threats, whatever the reason is illegal. Is there security camera footage of this event? Where are the witnesses? Well, haven't they said anything? I think we know why. It's hard to say something when you don't exist. But this fanciful tale from the Jesse Page is not even the most important takeaway from the LA Times article. Earlier in the piece, we're given the story of how Page came to the conclusion that she's really a man. So why don't you listen to this? Quote, one night he tried to knock himself out, took his knuckles to his face and pounded over and over until bruises formed. Four days after he sat in a lawn chair on the porch, ashamed his face store. And then you heard a voice. You don't have to feel this way. It was a small voice, barely discernible, but it kept echoing in its head, a way out. It was as if something in my brain turned around, recalls Page now 36, the agonizing voice saying, no, you're not. And no, you can't just switch to became very gentle and loving. Oh, maybe I'm trans. Why don't I explore that? Within weeks, he'd scheduled a Zoom consultation with a doctor to discuss top surgery. The procedure was scheduled for November. A month later, he announced to fans on Instagram who have known him since the release of June oh 13 years prior, that his name was Elliot, the writers of the Umbrella Academy, the Netflix superhero series on which he'd played a female character for two seasons, immediately began rewriting the role to make him trans. After shooting the third installment of the show in earlier in early 2021, Page sat down with Oprah Winfrey to discuss his transition. Within a span of a few months, he had become the most famous, famous transgender man in the world. And there was so much joy. Now that last part there is just there to conform with the apparent legal requirement that anytime you write an article about quote unquote, Elliot Page, you have to claim that she is experiencing joy or trans joy as it often is described. We are presented with the image of this small frail mutilated woman who no longer looks feminine but also looks nothing like a man at all and is stuck like so many in this perpetual limbo state, not feminine but not masculine, the worst of all worlds. And we're supposed to believe this is a picture of joy. There is no evidence of this joy. There's no evidence of joy in the trans community at all. There's a lot of anger, a lot of resentment. There is a desperation for approval and affirmation, their self-dictimization and persecution complex complexes. There's not much joy to be found. Yet the joy is there, we are assured. So much joy. Putting this phantom joy aside, pay attention to the process by which the artist formerly known as Ellen Page realized that she was really a guy named Elliot Page. She was depressed, she was into spare, literally beating the hell out of herself, engaging in self-harm and in the middle of what we now call a mental health crisis, hearing a voice in her head. And in that moment of a total emotional desperation and deep confusion, it occurred to her that maybe she might be trans. And a few weeks later, she had scheduled to chop off her breasts. A few weeks after that, she announced her trans identity to the world and immediately became, as they say, one of the most famous trans people in the world. So she went from a depressed actress to a joyful trans person in a matter of weeks. Again, focus on this. It only occurred to her that she might be trans in that moment when she was punching herself in the head. Shortly thereafter, she was surgically removing parts of her body. Now, we've already seen how these surgeries are approved basically on a whim. And they're so often approved for people who have documented histories of self-harm. It never occurs to the surgeons or it does and they don't care that the surgeries themselves are just another form of self-harm. Which in this case, have been given the veneer of medical validity. And what about this realization of her alleged transness? We're told that the rapid and exponential increase in trans identification is not a result of any kind of social contagion. We're told that trans people have always been trans people and that they've always existed in the world all throughout history. And yet so often, just as with Jesse Page, the self-identified trans people themselves will tell you that they didn't even consider the trans possibility until recently. Ellen Page was a lesbian for years before she decided that she's actually a heterosexual man, which means that by the way, her transition was a form of conversion therapy from gay to straight, which the left says is impossible. But never mind that. So what does this tell us? Does it tell us that transgenderism isn't an innate reality, a fundamental part of a person's identity? No. Genderism is a theory. Okay? It's a very modern and new theory. It is a theory much like germ theory or the theory of gravity. And I don't mean it's like those theories in the sense of being scientifically proven, like other theories are, obviously not. I mean that it's a theory in the sense that it's a system of ideas meant to explain something. So a theory is. But not all theories are created equal. Some succeed in explaining what they intend to explain, just as the theory of gravity does in germ theory. Others fail utterly like transgenderism. So there is a real phenomenon that transgenderism seeks to explain. There are people out there who feel depressed, out of place, lost, confused, uncomfortable with themselves, self-loathing. Those kind of people exist in the world and they exist in greater and greater numbers every day as modern culture specializes in creating this sort of depression and confusion. Genderism offers its theoretical explanation. It says that you feel out of place and uncomfortable because actually you should have been born with a different body than the one you have. The solution is to identify as having that body, even though you don't, and to insist that the world play along with your imaginary game. The next step is to begin cutting pieces of yourself off surgically altering your body to make it somewhat potentially appear as some kind of pale imitation of the body that you think you should have been born with. And once you've done all this, you'll feel better. That's the theory. And it's failed catastrophically by all objective measures. It also makes no rational sense to begin with, saying that you should have been born with a different body. It's like saying that you should have been born on Venus, or you should have been born as John Adams in the year 1735. It's incoherent. What do you mean should have? Nobody can explain what that means because it doesn't mean anything. But that's the theory. And people like Ellen Page, who are depressed, self-loathing, unhappy, begin to find this theory appealing. They start toying with the idea in their minds, and then they commit themselves permanently to it so that by the time the theory fails, it's too late. It's like if somebody came up with a competing theory of gravity, deciding that Isaac Newton was wrong, and they have a new theory. And then 15 minutes after inventing the theory, decided to jump out of a window on the 25th story, just to test it out. Well, they'll probably realize sometime before splattering all over the ground that the theory needed a little bit of work. But by then it's a little bit difficult to backtrack. This is what gender theory does. It tells people that they can fly and then opens the window and coaxes them to jump out. All of them, every single one, will hit the ground and it will hurt, and many will not survive. If there is any trans joy, if it happens at all, it happens very briefly sometime between the 25th story and the ground. And it always ends in tragedy. And that is why it would be useless to say that Jussie Page is canceled. Instead, all the people celebrating this, not to mention amplifying her outlandish hate crime stories are today canceled. And that'll do it for the show today. We'll talk to you tomorrow. Thanks for listening. Thanks for watching. Godspeed."
