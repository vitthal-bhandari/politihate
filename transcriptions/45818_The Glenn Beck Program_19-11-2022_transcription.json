    "text": " Today's guest has achieved the dreams of every musician. He is one Grammys. He shared the stage with Bob Dylan. He's been on Saturday Night Live, played the White House for Obama. He's worked with legendary producers, headline major festivals, including both Bonnaroo and Austin City Limits two times. His voice, his guitar, his banjo, have created music that has debuted on the top of the Billboard 200. I don't know how many times his songs have been played at weddings and dances and graduations and sporting events and funerals. And he always thought his career would stay on course, that he and his bandmates would tour the world and they were like the Rolling Stones and they just dropped dead. Then in 2021, 14 years after co-founding Mumford and Sons, he watched it all vanish like that. Like so many disasters these days, it started with a tweet and it wasn't even an unusual tweet. He had done tweets like this before it was a book review, something that he had read. It was a book recommendation. Ironically, the book is unmasked by Andy Noe, which details left-wing extremism and how it has become mainstream. Well, that didn't go well. So today, he's embracing the power of free speech with his new podcast, Marshall Matters on Spectator TV. His guests have included Don McLean, Candace Owens, Jordan Peterson. And like many of them, he was excommunicated from the Church of High Culture. He's fine with that. What good is membership if it demands self betrayal? Please welcome Winston Marshall. If you're only listening to this podcast, you're going to miss something special that I brought for this podcast in this box. It is something extraordinarily rare that I think he will really enjoy, you know, hanging from England and all that stuff. Anyway, let me tell you about our sponsor. And then we get right into the podcast over two decades ago, the founder of Covenant Eyes faced the same questions many people face today. How can I teach my children to use the internet and with integrity? How can my own heart remain pure online? How do I serve as an example to my family and to my church? So is this mission that was in mind the Covenant Eyes was created. Covenant Eyes is a world-class software and educational resource center, which now used by over 1 million people in the country.

My pleasure is mine. I remember when I got a very nice message of solidarity from you when I quit my band and I wasn't actually familiar with your work. You had the time. You can grab on YouTube, but I'll educate you quickly. But I was very grateful for the solidarity. It was very sweet of you. Thank you. I try to send something out to everybody who has been cancelled no matter where they stand, left or right. I find this as a human being and also as a dad and an artist somewhat. I find it really offensive for what's going on. This is not good. You're seeing this across the arts really. It's not just in your great country, but also in Britain. Artists are getting cast aside for having the wrong opinions or being forced to quit. That's quite a common thing. For example, there's a woman called Rosie Kay, who I recently interviewed. She's a choreographer. She had a dance company for 14, 15 years. Because of her gender critical opinions, she got ganged up on by the entire crew or the entire cast of dancers and was forced to resign. She put her life into this project. It was her everything. For artists as well, most artists don't make that much money. You build these things up over a career. Then you have it taken, swiped away from you like that. It's a very painful experience. They eventually, it goes around. I don't understand how artists in particular don't understand, and even homosexuals as well, have been forced into the closet for so long, especially in Great Britain. How they don't understand, wait a minute, I shouldn't be doing the same thing that was happening to me. Because eventually, it just eats its own, doesn't it? Just eventually consumes, you're never going to be politically correct enough for somebody. Well, I don't fully understand it. What do you mean that in terms of trying to abide by? By silencing others, especially when you have been silenced. By silencing others, you would think it would be very obvious. That's a bad thing. That's what we've been working on. Civil right. This is what we've been trying to stop. There's a serious free speech issue. I don't mean necessarily legally, although in Britain, certainly there's been legal issues on free speech where people have been losing their jobs. And police come to the door. That's also true. There's police in Britain are police coming to the door if you tweet the wrong thing, if you have gender critical opinions. Oh my gosh. There's certainly examples of that. But there's a culture of free speech that we've lost. So it's not necessarily that we still have the First Amendment. Well, you have this First Amendment here in the States. But there's this idea, I think, back to when Neil Young said he'd remove himself from Spotify if Spotify didn't get rid of Joe Rogan. Now, of course, I believe in Freedom of Association. That's totally legitimate. But it's the idea that it's not the association. It's the specific speech that people want removed. And for that to come from artists whose very career, who's founded on the premise that one needs to express themselves, how can one express themselves in that climate? How can one create art in that climate? How can create music? Right lyrics, great, great prose. It's insanity. And I've been very puzzled within the creative industries. I'm not entirely sure whether there's a large group of homogenous thinkers where let's say this progressive thought has really taken hold or whether a small minority of progressives have real power in self-sensoring. The masses, it's not entirely clear to me what is going on. There's evidence for both. For example, I had many, I quit Mumford and Sons last year. I had many artists messaging me saying they were self-sensoring. Hundreds, actually. Maybe I've had thousands of messages from all walks of life and all professions, but artists self-sensoring, and it's shocking. And it doesn't mean that we would know that we would be surprising that their self-sensored. Absolutely. And I'm not going to the show there. No, I'm not saying I'm not. Because it's because they speak in confidence. But that also speaks for the climate that they don't. I feel like I shouldn't say their names because I don't want to get them into trouble. Right. That's insane. So what was the tipping point for you? First of all, you left Mumford and Sons. Mumford's gone. You've written most of the songs. No, no, no, no. No, no. So the bands formed in 2007. Originally around Marcus the singer, he had a bunch of songs. And then as we grew, it turned out, that we all contributed songs. So I certainly contributed. Decent songs. And I'm actually now back here in your great country playing some of those songs. And I've been playing in California, New York and Arizona and playing some of those songs. But the band, we all contributed songs and kind of a queen thing. What do you mean? Queen, they, yeah, they never put their name as the author or they just made it. It's true. And we collaborated together and those songs developed together and they were shaped live. And they were shaped in this country. We toured America relentlessly. By the end of this trip, I visited 48 states in this great country. I was thinking, I mean, I love this. What are you missing? Hawaii and Alaska. You've got to see Alaska, Hawaii will. It's beautiful. But boy, that is progressive city. Really say, Oh, yeah, very progressive. I was very shocked in California. So I did a show in Los Angeles and so showing San Francisco and I haven't been back for a while. And every other store in both those cities has some sort of token marker to a progressive course, whether it's a rainbow flag or a trans flag or a BLM thing or some sort of virtue signaling to an identity group. And it seemed to me, and actually in San Francisco as well, there's a huge mural to Greta Tunberg outside my, outside my hotel, like the sort of Machian Saint of eco-anxiety. And it seems to me, it reminded me about in the in the scripture when the Jews marked their homes with the blood of the lamb so that the angel of death would pass over them when the plagues were the first born. And it's almost, and I'm sure this is true in Portland, Oregon, it's almost as if people are marking their property so it doesn't get bad. I don't want to be so rude about California and America because I absolutely love this country. It's just as an asset. No, we've changed. We've changed and you're spot on. And even during some of the riots, you know, a lot of these were black owned stores that they burned down. And they would, you know, put the plywood on the windows and then spray paint. We're black owned. Please don't burn down. Eventually they come and eat everybody. But it's what a great analogy of the lamb's blood. Well, this is what's got me into trouble. Originally, the reason I had to quit Mumford and Sons is because I tweeted about a book, Critical or Far Left Extremism in the United States by the author, the conservative author Andy No, and he documented in that book, the 19 killed in the first 14 days, the BLM riots, and the many black businesses ruined and destroyed in the ensuing riots. And just to paint a picture of the climate in the music industry, in June 2020, in that heinous killing of George Floyd happened, the music industry on mass put up black squares and it became a picket line. If you didn't put a black square up, oh, yeah, you didn't support black lives, Matt, the angel of death was visiting your home. Absolutely. Now here's an example of it. The band Hanson. I don't know if you remember this. Oh, I do. They're friends. They really live up the street. Oh, great. Well, you should get them in to talk about this because apparently they didn't exist as a band. Didn't put a black square up because they didn't exist. Their fans got so angry at the fact that they had to reform in order to apologize to the mob. And that shows how fervent the time watch. So it's mob rule. It really is mob. Absolutely. So I got into trouble because I was critical of that specific or the excesses of it because if look, of course, we care about black lives. Of course, of course, we want to see every American, every human lifted up and we want to create a level playing field from which to start. Correct. And we also want cops like the guy who killed George Floyd. Want them out. Don't want any bad cops. But they're not all bad. Absolutely. But the problem you get is people want to ignore the bads, the excesses of certain behavior, if they believe it's a good cause, which means that bad things happen. And that's a serious issue. So now, since I've come out and been in sort of trouble, I feel like it's my duty a little bit to speak out on these issues where I think that there are excesses and having come from a liberal background, you know, my dad ran for liberal Democrats in the UK. I was brought up canvassing for the liberals paying. Let's what is a liberal over there? Well, misunderstands American liberals. And progressive is different than a liberal. A liberal here should be a somebody who believes in the Bill of Rights and will fight for the rights of the average person. A conservative is over here, a person that wants the smallest amount of government so it can never get out of hand and do the things that it's doing right now. Progressives are the same in both countries. So is that a liberal to you? So I would distinguish myself as being neither conservative or progressive, but rather a liberal and a classical liberal British liberal tradition. And I believe, I do believe that we need some government because I think that's all right. I don't believe in libertarian. I believe that unchecked and unregulated, the system isn't totally fair. And then I guess there's a bunch of social issues that progressives have gone completely awry on. For example, I wrote a piece on Barry Weiss, a sub stack, and I quoted Martin Luther King. And his, you know, I have a dream speech where he said we should judge people by the content and the character and the color of it. And I was called racist for quoting him. I know. I mean, is that, am I insane? No, no, no, no. Okay, it's not something the other day. Somebody said somebody posted a quote on, I don't know, Facebook or something. I thought it was the best. Am I actually a Nazi fascist or just a normal person 10 years ago? Because everything that you thought held dear like Martin Luther King. Now you say that and no, you're a racist. If you're getting called racist for quoting Martin Luther King, I think we can see now what's going on. Those terms have lost all meaning. Fascist, Nazi, racist, it's and it's really dangerous because once they don't have meaning, racism, fascism, it does exist. Exactly. And you if you've made those terms, you know, it's a little boy, you cried wolf. If everybody's a racist, then how do we stop real racism? Exactly. How do we identify that? But and also, frankly, it's it's a disrespect. What happened before? Yes. My grandmother was a Holocaust survivor. The idea that I'm called a Nazi now, given that 13 people in my family were obliterated by the Nazis in the camps and the death marches, is offensive to my family. Although it's so absurd that it's beyond offense, like this is ridiculous. But it kind of, it changes history, it changes how we understand history. So those the the battle, the word battle, the semantic battles going on there are just very insane, insane. I was just I just had was it last week I had Benjamin Netanyahu on, and he gave me the defender of Israel award years ago. However, I'm still a Nazi. I was and we were joking about it. It's like, none of it makes sense anymore. Let's look at what people are doing content of their character. I figured I'd have more credibility. Well, maybe if I'm not talking like I'm a chimney sweep. Doesn't work. Man, I wish I had that accent. You'd think I was smarter, honestly, and with a pair of glasses. My gosh, nobody would even recognize me. Let me tell you about good ranchers. Good news and bad news. The bad news first looks like beef prices are probably going to increase by another 20% early next year. Eggs are already up 40% year over year. Nothing like the largest price increases, especially in meat in US history. Now, here's the good news. Good ranchers is letting you lock in your price on all the meat you buy this November. When you subscribe during their Black Friday savings, this is your chance to inflation proof your meat budget. You're going to get $70 of free USDA choice stakes and you'll save an additional $25 on every box when you subscribe. So forget the high prices and the low quality at the grocery store. Believe me, it's probably not even American meat. I know it says product of America. That means nothing truly. Treat yourself for somebody you love to good ranchers award winning service and their quality this holiday season. Remember, visit good ranchers.com slash GLENN or use my code Glynn at the checkout and grab their best offer of the year. Black Angus have a black, don't have a normal Black Friday, have a Black Angus Friday this year. Get two free stakes from good ranchers right now. American meat delivered. So let's finish up on the the Mumford and Sun stuff because you posted that and then you apologized. Right. So I, the story specifically was that through the pandemic, I was posting books. I was reading as one of the themes of my social media. I didn't have many followers on social media. And I've tweeted about books from mouth that read book to Tolstoy's War and Peace, whatever I was reading, I found interesting. And one of the books, as I said, was Andy Nose book. And somehow it just completely exploded in a sort of Twitter storm. These things happen. And they say Twitter isn't real life until it's real life. And that's true because initially I was like, it's just a storm, it will pass. But then you get the phone calls. Then you get your friends, people you work with calling you up, some of them are worried for you, some of them are worried about what's going on. They don't understand what's going on. And then you slowly see your life unraveling. And fortunately now it's been 16, 18 months and I've, I've bought a new life. So I feel stronger talking about it. But for a long time, it was, it was very painful to talk about that time and the coming months. And so I issued an apology, partly because when you're, when you're under attack, let's say if you're at dinner table and you say something offensive, someone's offended by what you say, you tell, I'm so sorry. How, what do I not know? Explain to me. So I was certainly open to not understanding the full picture. And I was wanted to protect my bandmates who were getting pulled under the bus with me. So I issued an apology. And then in the coming months, gradually and gradually I looked deeper and deeper into the topic. And I realized I hadn't, I hadn't been wrong. I'd called the author brave. Not only was he brave, he'd been attacked by Antifa mobs in Oregon, but he was then attacked again. Video of that came out again in a, in a hotel. They find him incredibly brave. Exactly. And questionably great. And and so my conscience really started to bother me. I was also frustrated that by excuse, I felt like I was in some way excusing the behavior and T for by apologizing for criticizing it, which then made me feel well, then I'm as, I'm as bad as the problem because I'm, I'm sort of agreeing that it's, it doesn't exist. Which I found very frustrating. Another point, by the way, I found it very frustrating that, that the left wing media in this country and in my country don't even talk about it. We can all see this footage. We see it online. They don't talk about it. And that's part of my, I think interest initially in tweeting about Andy's book, because I think people need to see what's going on. And it's a blind spot there. But anyway, I, I, wait, wait, wait, when you say they don't talk about it, you mean the average person talks about it, but it doesn't talk about CNN and MSNBC, all of this. If they don't cover it, Biden in his presidential election said it was just an idea. Didn't exist. I mean, did he not see the courthouse in Oregon being burnt down? Yep. Like night after night, you know, always outrage for the Capitol Hill storming rightly. What about the outrage when federal buildings are being? Amen. Now, I know I'm British and it's going to jar with your American listeners to hear a brick commenting on your, on your politics. But I care about America. I love America. And a successful great America is a means a successful great world as far as I'm concerned. So I hope you respect my urine safe territory here. So then another thing was that there's this essay and we spoke about this a little bit before speaking now by Alexander Sotsenitz and who live not by lies. And he wrote it, I think 1973, 1974, when he was expelled from Moscow. He didn't know he was being expelled. He wrote it. It's my understanding. He wrote it thinking that this may be the last communication he's allowed to have. And so he wrote it and released it. And then I think it's the next day he was expelled. Interesting. Yeah. So this essay, which I encourage listeners to read about five pages long, includes a paragraph where it says something along the lines of how do you call yourself a musician, an artist, sorry, if you are not prepared to live by the truth. And that affects me. And each time I read it, it hit harder and harder and harder. And this apology that was out there, that I'd issue, it felt like to me that that apology would detract from all I could create moving forward. Because whatever song I write, whatever prose I write, how can I say that it's true if I have this apology? You are so rare. You are so rare. So eventually, I decided the only way out of this was for me to quit now. For context, the band had been told by several radio stations. They wouldn't be played again. I was due to play a DJ, a festival in the UK, and they dropped me. There were repercussions, professional repercussions for my opinion. And if I'd been a sole actor, things would have been very different. But I had a responsibility to them. And I didn't want them to be harmed for my opinion. So I thought the best way forward, the only way forward really was for me to quit. And I explained so in a medium letter, my objective was to clear my conscience. I wasn't sleeping, I lost a ton of weight. I was losing my mind a little bit. And even making myself lose my mind. I was telling my crazy, then you start, you know, I tell you, when you first go through this, I talk to people who say, Oh, no, it doesn't bother me at all. I don't think about it. You're either a liar or you're really shallow. Because in 2007, there's this associated press poll that comes out most admired men in the world. I was tied for third with the Pope and Nelson Mandela. That's how sick America was. Okay. And I'm like, what? I do the same show. I was on CNN. I do the same show over on Fox the next year. I'm one of the most hated men in America. You want to talk about schizophrenia. I go through this. And you know, when you have a good majority of people saying, you're a racist, you're a bigot, you're a Nazi, you're this. If you're a thinking, feeling human being, you take that at some point and go, how I don't think I'm that, how are they getting that? And you do an inventory of your life. Yes, you know what I mean? And that's one of the good things, I think, that comes out of this for the individual. You come out stronger. Oh, certainly. Because you know who you are. You most certainly do. And actually, to be totally honest, I don't care that much. Or perhaps at all, what random people on Twitter, I don't know or think. But I do care about what the people around me and the people who I love and who say they love me care. So when they're doing it, it's very painful. So for me, that's what I think affected me. But what kept me strong and what has given me sucker for all of this is my faith in God. And that has kept me, that's been the foundation of my family. I have a very tight knit family and very close for my mum and dad. So that's what you gets you through those difficult times. And had I not had God, had I not had Christ in my life, I'm not sure how I could have got through that period. I don't want to take too much of a sidetrack from this, but this like third time you've mentioned God, and then you mentioned Christ by name. It's my understanding that you have always said you're not a Christian, you're not religious, but you're spiritual, you're. So I was raised by a Catholic mother and a person father in a sort of ecumenical household. I lost my faith aged 1819 and had my twenties, I would say without faith, at points atheistic, at points agnostic. When I was an atheist, I probably had too many morals for an atheist. And that's not a day. That's not a dig at atheists. It's more that I do think we need a metaphysic on which to build an ethic and a moral. Jordan Peterson talks about it, and I believe this. I happen to believe it's all true, but even if it's not, it's made me a better person. Your faith. How so? How so? It gives me someone to answer to that's not human. It gives me someone to model myself after. I mean, you look at God and you just think of him as a dad. That's a pretty good model, you know, of especially when you start to have children, you you never stop loving your children. No matter what they've done, you are always open to, come on back, come on back. It's no big deal. Did you, did you, did you, do you know you screwed up? Do you know what happened? Come on in. I'm not judging you. I'm not, I've been there. And that's a really good model for, I think, for a parent and for a human being. Okay. So did you, did you, so is wait, just to finish that I came back to my faith, having gone through the experience of divorce. And I would say that philosophically, I was at the church door beforehand. Yeah. And through people like Jordan Peterson, his biblical series, it's just exceptional. And it brought me back to Scripture. But it was through the experience of suffering that I actually came back fully, spiritually to Christ. And thank God I did. Because the period, it wasn't long too long afterwards that I went through, and as I said, had it not been for him, I'm not sure how to fed so well. Yeah. I, okay, I just, I can't off subject here. I just read 2nd Chronicles this morning before I did my show. And it was chapter 15 starting, I think at three. And it basically says, it describes today. And it's like the people had lost the God, the true God, they've lost the truth. And nations were rising up against nations. It was, it was frightening to be out on the street, very dangerous to be out. And then it said, and then because of all this, they found the God of Israel again, you know, still a lot of price to be paid. But the, the message in it was, so don't give up your work will benefit in the end. And I thought, that's, I think that's what's happening in the world. We've just, we've made other things are God. And when you make other things, you're God. Well, if it gives me great stuff, and all I have to do is this, that's great. Yeah. You know, well, I see, I've seen that not only in my own personal life, like I, it was a period I made work, my God. And I was, I was quite literally addicted to touring and getting in the studio and working and working. But then if you talk on, on mass, and I just had Michael Shellingberger, a violinist, on my, on my show, and he describes the environmentalist cause as a surrogate religion. And it's very true, because we have lost God, and there are people don't have the belief like that we used to in the West. And so they're replacing it with these, these other causes. And like I described earlier, it's, it's, it's, it's biblical how people are putting tokens outside their shops. And it's, it's biblical to put a mural of Greta Tumburg as if, you know, like she's the Virgin Mary or something, an innocent, an innocent girl. There's all these weird equivalents, but it doesn't have the found push for abortion. The way it's being done now, just this bloodlust almost is, is, is Moloch. I mean, it is Old Testament worship, just not done intentionally, but we are doing the same thing. We are worshiping other gods, whether we know it or not. When the alarm clock goes off in the morning and you open your eyes is pain. The first thing you think about used to be for me. I would get up every day and I'd be like, and all I would want to do is get back into bed. And I would be like, I don't know how I'm going to get through the day, but I'll get through it and I'll come back and I'll sleep. It was a problem that I thought would never go away. And it's a problem that I don't have anymore, because I started taking relief factor and I got my life back. I can paint, I can write, I can even think in the morning without, you know, the first thing, how I hurt relief factor. I want you to try it for three weeks. Just go to relieffactor.com. That's relieffactor.com. Or to their trial pack, try it for three weeks. See if it doesn't take away your pain. That's relieffactor.com. So let's go back to my friends. You've been friends with band, with bandmates, I mean, you're bandmates. We're your friends, right? Yeah. I was surprised to see that at least it felt this way to me that they didn't rally around. We know him. Did they? I wish them very well. They're incredibly talented musicians and artists and songwriters. And I have no doubt that they will have very important careers and I hope they continue to create great, create great art. And I would hate for anything I do to impede that. So, you know, I really, I really wish them well. That is the nicest, most Christian thing I think you could say. So you leave and, you know, the good thing is there's a lot of openings for banjo players. You know, there's no job competition. This is why I started with the banjo because in London, no one played. And so if I got myself into a band, there would be no one to take my place. I didn't have to be good. I was terrible at guitar. And so I never got a gig. So, yeah, no, you're not, you're not wrong. But, yeah, as I said, I think earlier, I, this is my first time playing, I'm doing, I'm playing songs that I've written over the years. I brought a banjo. I know you brought a banjo. Glen, your colleague brought a banjo made in China. Now, he's fired. It's listening to you right now. Exactly. Although in Goldstone, I think it's a Florida base. I used to play Goldstone. So it's a, so they're designed in America. Yeah. But manufactured in China. Now we like the Chinese, but it's the CCP. We want to make sure, you know, if you ever thought, they have this conversation with people all over the country. You know, Glen, I think if we just all got together in our town, we could probably fix this in about 20 minutes. The people are starting to wake up. It's not the parties, per se. It's not the, it's not ethnic bait. It's nothing. It's governments. Absolutely. They are the problem with the people. And they just think that it's like we're out of in a stage play. And we don't know we're going to play. And they do. You know, it's really nuts. It's not too hard to make the definition. Actually, I work a lot with, technically, Chinese, but Hong Kong is in Britain. I have a foundation, an organization pairing. Hong Kong is fleeing the CCP. We're taking over Hong Kong and they're coming to Britain. We're helping them assimilate and integrate any British listeners. We need volunteers. So Hong Kong link up. Let us know how we can help you. Yeah. But yeah, the CCP are horrible. Yeah. And unfortunately, I didn't understand when all my big, big business friends said to me 20 years ago, you know, China is the model. I remember saying, that's not a very good model. And they're like, well, it's works over there. And it's really the model of the future. Now we're seeing where it really is the model. I mean, we are moving towards that kind of state, which is terrifying. Well, what's particularly terrifying, I think, something I can speak on specifically to the CCP, it's not only Hong Kong, but the Uighurs. So I've been trying to raise awareness for the Uighurs. And it's so difficult to do this. And I can't quite work out why. But there's between one and three million Uighurs interned in camps in Western China and Jingjiang. No, no, China. The CCP says, that's true. Those were just we see videos. I don't show. You're an apologist for the CCP. No, this is quite a term. I love the video. They just put out with some guy on the street. And he's like, you know, there's all these things that are being said about us in here in China. No, look, here's a Uighur man who's happy. I think I saw this movie done by gerbils. A town for the Jews. Yeah. And not only are there videos, but we had a Uighur tribunal in the UK with testimonies of people who have fled and escaped. And this is the sort of tyranny of the CCP. And it's not just them. It's the Tibetans, the Mongolians, the Hong Kongers, Taiwan's next. That's only a matter of time. I'm very surprised about how little concern my generation and younger have for the CCP. And I'm not entirely sure why that is. I've been thinking about that. Why is it? Well, partly, I think because China is culturally so alien from us, like the language is impenetrable and impenetrable is wrong. But it's certainly very difficult. I've tried to learn it. It's the hardest language I've ever tried to learn. And a lot of their culture doesn't come over. I mean, of course, their food and some of the religious stuff comes over. But why is it that the people in Britain, for example, will march the streets when George Floyd 5000 miles away gets brutally murdered. But then I went on a Uighur march in Parliament Square in Westminster the same two months later, where 3 million Uighurs are in these interment camps. And there's 25 of us. How is it that there's this attention given to American problems, but no attention to this is the same problem of what was the name in England? I feel bad. I can't remember it right now. The guy who stops slavery, William Wilberforce. Yeah, Wilberforce. This is the same problem Wilberforce had. How do I get people to pay attention and say this slavery is wrong? The problem with it is so ugly. No one wants to deal with it. It's so ugly that no one thinks that they can actually affect it. And, you know, I'm getting my stuff cheaper. So, I mean, it's this weird moral but quagmire. Wilberforce, if you bring that up. So the people of Britain at the time went on a sugar strike where they refused to buy sugar as a signal that they were disapproved on mass. They did this to disapprove of the slave trade. So he managed to get the attention of the masses on that deplorable trade. What seems to be so impossible with not just the weakest, but any of the behavior of the CCP is to actually capture the imagination of the masses in the West. It just doesn't happen. And I don't know if we need some kind of horrible footage, but we've got footage of the weakest. Oh, it's bad. So we've got footage of Hong Kong and we know what's going on over there. So why it's not, it's still a bit of a mystery. And perhaps that's because there's some sort of, go ahead. There's some sort of, you know, when there's a social justice cause, one feels like one has to go along with what's been presented on question. And so because it's, no one's really presenting the case for the week as well. Actually, that's not true. I've been trying, but because it's not a popular movement. People aren't, you know, going along with it. I'm not sure I know. Yeah, I think we're at the beginning of this fight. Remember, this is, I mean, I've studied the Holocaust quite a bit. And it's not much different than what Americans were doing in World War II. You know, you'd have it. I mean, you had the information. We had it, went to our president, went to everybody was in the papers. New York Times just kept bearing it. Even Jews here, not all of them, but even a lot of Jews here were like, let's not cause any problems. We don't, you know, it was, it's a weird thing that humans do from time to time where they can, they can look away from that. But there'll be one person over here that is, you know, George Floyd. It's bad. But in comparison, we don't want either of them, but this one is horrifying because it's happening all the time, every day, 24 hours a day to millions of people. And somehow or another, we can see this, but we can't see that. Yeah. Now, we might, and there's, there's good reason to, to march at the injustices that blacks are facing here and elsewhere. And, and George Floyd, it's not a criticism of that necessarily. It's more a criticism of the lack of protests. Sure. I know. Anyway, so yeah. And it's, I think we're just at a better place now than, you know, in the 19th, it's not the 1960s anymore. There's that, that's a past generation. And I think there's a lot of people who truly are colorblind. They saw, they listened to Martin Luther King, and they, they're, I'm with you. I'm with you. I don't, I don't want any of that to happen. And yet I think it's our politicians that are, and people who are craving power or money or whatever that are separating us, the most part. I noticed you put the banjo down. So you're not going to put it down. Well, I didn't bring my finger picks, but, well, you know what, if I'm me back and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and he'll show for you. So, you just had somebody I have wanted to have on my show forever. You just had them on your podcast, Don McLean. Oh, yeah. What a total legend. Unbelievable. Yeah. Did you ask him about bye, bye Miss American Pie. What is that? American Pie. Yeah. American Pie. Yeah. Yeah. So that song's now 50 years old. I mean, it's, it's the surely, it's the number one song in the American songbook. Yeah. And he, he actually was interesting. He talked about it in, in, he'd likened, and I, I encourage people to listen to the episode, and he likened to it, the cancel culture stuff. He said, I was writing about this 50 years ago. It was. And, and it's in the day the music died. And he's like, that's this is, this is what's happening for cancel culture. And so he's, he's a very switched on gentleman and, and you know, what a career he had. And he was, when he started, he would do these tours up and down the Hudson River with, with Bill Monroe, Bill Monroe, famous communist and, and, but also great pioneer of the banjo for his sins. He wrote this superb introduction. I can't imagine a communist with a banjo. It just doesn't seem. There are lots. There are lots. Oh, no, sorry. It's not Bill Monroe. I made a total mistake. It's Pete Seger. Oh, okay. Yeah. Forgive me. Pete Seger. Not Bill Monroe. Yeah. I don't know. Total politics. Total politics. Yeah. That's a terrible mistake. This land is your land. So they, and Seger would do these tours with, with musicians and professors, intellectuals and poets and bring, and bring these people together. And Don McLean was about that. And he was brought up in that environment. And back then, it was them who were being made to shut up. Yeah. It was, it was the, the leftists who were told by a majority on the right. And this goes on later as well into the 80s and 90s. And was it tip gore, Al Gore's wife? Yeah. Yeah. And she was the one who wanted to, you know, is trying to shut up by ST. And it's normally come, or sorry, not normally, in America, it seems traditionally it's this moves against free speech have tended to come from the right, but that's, I think, completely changed now. And it's coming from the progressives, not the liberals, because if you're a liberal, if you actually are a liberal, you believe in free speech. Otherwise you're not a liberal. I'm sorry to break it to you. I consider myself a classic liberal. You know, just, can we just leave each other alone? Just leave each other alone. I want to share a testimony with you about a young mom who came into a preborn pregnancy clinic. Babies, not really in her plans. And even after seeing a halo on her baby on ultrasound, she was still leaning towards abortion. But then she heard the heartbeat. That's when she chose life. When an expected mom has an unplanned pregnancy, preborn is there. And not just to save the baby's life, help her bring it into the world, but to care for it, long term, when they have an ultrasound, and they can hear and see the baby, most moms have a divine encounter. We have a goal of saving 50,000 babies this year. And we're way behind. Would you sponsor an ultrasound and introduce a mother to her unborn child for only $28 that buys one ultrasound for these women who are coming in? $140 helps to rescue five babies lives. And now through a match, your gift is going to be doubled. To donate just dial pound 250 and say the keyword baby, that's pound 250 keyword baby, or donate securely at preborn.com slash Glenn. That's preborn.com slash Glenn. So you started your podcast. Yeah. So I've been having a great time. So it's called Marshall Matters with a spectator. And I should say my agenda in coming to your show is to plug my show. Okay. Just as, as, just there's no secrets. But I've been having a great time and exploring all the taboo topics that artists don't feel like they can speak. I just actually had a great Irish artist, I won't name, but text me saying I'm so happy you're talking publicly about this gender critical stuff because the trans stuff is one of those issues. And I understand it's the same here in America that you just cannot talk about it. And then JK Rowling's the famous example. I think it's worse over there. I mean, this is hard to say, but I mean, what they're doing to JK Rowling is insane. Yeah, insane. Yeah, she gets death threats people not working for the actors. What is the average person over there? Think about that. Or are they afraid to say? That's a good question. You know, the leader of the opposition, Sakeer Starmer, who runs the Labour Party, which would, I guess it's not quite equivalent to the Democrats, probably a bit more left. More left. Well, I can't say that anymore. Change now. But he couldn't answer the question, what is a woman? And I think the average person probably sees that. I'll take your, I'll take your party and raise you a Supreme Court justice that can't do it either over here. Right. Okay. Wow. Well, I think when the average person sees that, I think they don't understand the gender wars and that they don't care. They've got real problems to deal with. But when they see that, they think, is he in like, is he mad? Why can't he answer that basic question? Why is that basic question? Right. And then if you can't answer a basic question like that, how are we supposed to believe you on anything else? So I think, I guess that's what most people think. However, I think also, now that women are being attacked in prisons, rapes in this country, in New Jersey, it was it was at Demi Minor, who raped and impregnated two women in prison, in a female prison. We have equivalent Karen White in Britain. But women's places are threatened. Women are threatened. We need to protect our women. Then there's what's happening to children, the puberty blockers in Britain, that's been paid, puberty bodies and irreversible surgery in Britain. That's been paid for by the state. Right. That's not starting to do that now. But you guys are stopping in, aren't they? So yes, this is what's been encouraging is that the Tabasdok Center, which was the center undertaking this baby, this surgery, has been told to close by next year. So that's a small victory. So I'm hopeful that we're going in the right way. But didn't the NIH come out and say there's no reason for this? I mean, I thought they took a harder line on it and just shutting down that clinic guy. I thought they were going to say sorry or the NHS. Yeah. Yeah. I've understood that it's due to close. It's been told to close. I think there's some people trying to defend it still, but I think it will it will close. So not to stop. But I think people, when they start seeing that, they see they see their wives and their children threatened this way. Men stick up for it. Women, it's a very misogynistic movement. Women are constantly being told to shut up. Event bright, I just saw yesterday, have deplatformed women again, defending women's sports, some sort of event ticketing organization. And the other thing, which I think affects people is the concept of truth, particularly when in our schools, again paid for by the state, children have been taught weird things about what is true and what is not true. It's anti-science and it confuses children. I've got two cousins who are teachers, and they show me what they're having to teach their students, their young students. And it's completely bananas. And no wonder the kids are going to be confused. And if that's the starting point, how's the rest of the education? Oh, it's hard. So I think normal people, that's not hard to understand. In fact, that's much easier to understand than the gender nonsense that we're being fed with. Caitlyn Jenner understands that. Well, actually, I met, I actually didn't meet, but Buck Angel, who was a female to male transsexual, was at my show in Los Angeles. And he has been very brave and standing up and saying, this is not okay to put children through. This is a serious procedure to go through. And I will not let anyone indoctrinate our children into this irreversible damage. And there are transsexuals, transgenders who are bravely standing up, because it's caught fire and it's what Yum called a psychic endemic. And it's very shocking. And we've seen this at different periods. The head and Joyce describes it very well in her book, trans, and she's another guest I've had on my show, you should have her on the show actually, she's superb. I think she's written the definitive book on the topic, which she describes as well. There was an endemic of an erector in Hong Kong about 15 years ago. And it's the same thing. Once these kids get the idea, it just grows out unchecked. And it's up to the adults to say, no, stop and protect and protect the children. So that's your original question. Normal people care about children, they care about women and they need to protect both of them. I have to tell you, I think the leftist move with trans and mainly with trans, it is so anti woman, so anti woman and so insulting that you are just about your body parts. And that makes you a woman. No, there's lots of differences between men and women. And to tell women that they have to identify him. I mean, if that's if it look, we're friends, we're in the streets, whatever, you're a friend of a friend, whatever, you come over and you're like, I am Judy. Hey, Judy, how are you? I'm not going to say it. Leave your life. Yeah, live your life. But when you when you cross over and force people to say Judy is the most beautiful woman you've ever seen. And she is a woman when if I go to a hospital, because Judy's laying on the ground and I call an ambulance and I'm a friend, I say to the doctor, by the way, biologically a male, they have to know that stuff. They have to know that stuff. So why would I be lying? Am I lying the rest of the time? You can't you can't do that. You just can't do that. And the lie has gone too far. And it's but I hope that it's been brought now. It's because it's coming to be checked, which is which is a good thing. Are you afraid? I just read a story. Well, you know, you studied improv, didn't you? You've done your research, Claire. Yeah, yeah. I did a little bit of improv. It didn't go very well. But it's over. Well, because I was like, this isn't a funny conversation. Maybe it's me. The I just read a story from Germany today, what could possibly go wrong between inflation and the lack of fuel, if it's a very cold winter, boondish bank is now billions of dollars. They're sucking in and they're holding on to because they're afraid of power outages and shortages. And people will start to go to the bank and say, I want my money out and there'll be a run on the bank. And they said that they were looking for what was it they were preparing for? Something like spirited exchanges with the Germans. And I'm like, I think you're thinking of riots, but that's okay. We are a financial or a cold winter away from real trouble with people who can't recognize what a woman is. How are we going to fare through that? Yeah, I mean, I'm very anxious about this winter and because England is really affected by this, right? England's very effective. Not as much as Germany, but we've cost a different crisis. It's absolutely insane. And there's other things. And as we speak, it's COP 27 going on. And there's a lot of bad ideas about how to deal with the environment, which again, make things expensive, for example, in our country, where very against natural gas and fracking, which would be a cheaper solution to deal with some of our energy crisis, a crisis, a looming crisis. And we're going into a Russia only crane ago into war. When do Russia lose wars when they're in the winter? They don't. This is going to be a long one. And Putin's been making more money selling less oil because of our policy, which again, it seems. Thank you for taking a share of that, even though you shouldn't because of our policy. It's our policy. Well, no, it's Britain's to the same. We've been doing the sanctions and they've got foreign reserve. They've got Russia, they've got foreign reserves. People are still buying all its completely worked against our interests. And it's the working people of Britain who are going to suffer the most. All of them all over the world. All over the world. Yeah, exactly. Can I go back to your family heritage in the Holocaust? Of course. Just to, first of all, which camp? A mixture. So the story, my grandma, they were from Transylvania and left quite late because the Holocaust started in earnest late in Hungary. But then it was very rapid in 1943. It got in 44. It was awful. My grandmother and her brother and her parents fled. Actually, this is incredible. We have, I have her diaries describing the experience going through, from Transylvania, through Munich. They got fake papers. They changed their name, through Munich, eventually to France and then to Portugal, and they stayed out of the rest of the war in Portugal. And I have all of her. Wow. And to describe her feelings at the time? Or is it just more of them? Well, it's quite an interesting read because it's a bit like Harper Lee or To Kill a Mockingbird or the J.D. Salinger book, Capture in the Right, because you read it as the reader, you're the adult. You sort of understand what the child doesn't see. And so you really, she would have been 13, 12, 13, 14, exactly. And so she doesn't fully grasp how huge what's going on around her. She should publish this. I would like to, I'm going to try and translate it. She was a brilliant woman and she spoke in seven languages. She actually wrote them all in French. So fortunately, I can read it because I can't read Hungarian. But so one incident, for example, is there gets stopped at some border, I think, maybe the Swiss border. And she and they, and she describes seeing Nazi officers on the platform, and one of them slipping in the ice and the others pointing and laughing. And it was just so curious to me that she would, she would think to jot that down in her, like that was a thing. And another thing that's actually, the most moving thing about it is that she got all her cousins to write goodbye notes. Now, at that time, they didn't know they couldn't have known. Well, they'd known they'd have left. They wouldn't have known what had happened. And so we've got all these goodbye notes. And it's only been recent that my dad for the family researched and find out where specifically everyone went. And it's also more complicated than that. So there's a superb play by Sir Tom Stoppard, called Leopoldstad that I recommend because it describes a Jewish family in Vienna, a family going through both wars over several generations. And the family, they're Jewish, but they also, it's a bris and a baptism. It's Christmas and Hanukkah. And it's, and it's, I never kind of understood that about my family, because there was a Christian influence, and I didn't understand why. And I think it's partly to do with fighting it, or wanting to be a part of a high society or part of society, not even high society. And another thing that the play explores is false memories and repressed memories, things hidden. So my grandma she's passed now a few years, but she would always deny being Jewish. And despite the birth certificate, Israelite, just no, no, and it was a taboo. We couldn't talk about it. It was very traumatizing for her. And you know, there are even examples, there was one survivor, aunt TT, who had, I think she'd been in two camps, Auschwitz, and then another one further north in the north, I forgot the name. And she had the tattoo. And my mom asked her, well, how, how does she have the tattoo? She was like, Oh, no, she was married to a Jewish man. So they come up with, they come up that she had come up with ways to make her make sense of the trauma of it. But how, how, how can one make sense of it when all of the cousins and uncles are, are wiped out? How to deal with that? It's, it's, one, one, that's, can't necessary. Do you think it's the other side of the coin that you're wrestling with with China? I mean, here you have a whole family and they're fine. And their countrymen are fine. And then quickly, all of a sudden, all their countrymen turn on them. And they don't leave because they don't think it could happen. It's like, it's not going to happen to us. It's, we're fine. We know our neighbors. Yeah. Isn't it this? It's the same, it's just the other side of the same coin, isn't it? That certainly was the case for my great grandfather. He fought in the first war with the Hungarians. And so the idea that they would then turn on him, how, how that must feel is, is beggar's belief. If you, when you, when you commit your life, you risk your life for a people and then those same people turning it to another, I think that's something that Jewish people have been, have been dealing with millennia. Yeah. Yeah. What are your thoughts on Kanye? Do you know Kanye? I haven't met Kanye. Okay. I, well, I, I love his music. I think he is a musical genius. Apparently, that's a contentious thing to say. I think it's, it didn't used to be. It didn't used to be. And then he started voting another way or talking about God and all of a sudden he's not a genius. He's crazy. He has said some amazing things. I, I love that he said, fear God and you shall fear nothing else. I think that's superb. I think it's absolutely true. I have no qualms whatsoever in saying that his recent spat of comments and statements have are absolutely anti-Semitic and saying he'd go death con three on, on Jewish people is, is horrible. And I find it strange that so few people find that easy to condemn him. Having said that, obviously he's lost now one and a half billions worth of his business being dropped by Adidas and, and the stuff. So is that cancel culture or is that just, well, that's being an association. Because that's, if that is cancel culture, then that's, that's a type I don't have. Unless it's coordinated. Well, look, to, to be anti, to say anti-Semitic things like that, that's not that that's not okay. That is that is hateful. And that's different from defending women. That's different from JK running who said nothing transphobic. She's been actually quite loving to people who have transgender. And that's very different to explicit anti-Semitic. But don't you think comments? Don't you think, I mean, I think one of the problems of the world is, I don't know what it's like in England, but here in America, on every street, there is some yokel that is like, do you tell your kids? Yeah, I don't know. You see them outside stay away. There's always somebody on the block who's like nuts one way or another. And I like knowing who that is. So I can avoid them, you know what I mean? But, you know, now that person has found all of the other people like them on everybody else's street. And we're like, God, we've got to stop them. They've always been here. They've always been here. We just need to know who they are and then move on. My problem is because you have a right to disassociate for me if you want. It's when the pressure starts to come. And you're not doing it because you believe in it. You're doing it because we better not, you know, we're going to lose sales. We're going to lose this. And then it's coordinated. The attack is coordinated. What he said was bad. Don't get me wrong. But and I'm not sure which it is in this case. Is it part of the attack that he's been under the whole time? Or is this real? The only is what he's saying what he really thinks is that no, no, no. First of all, let's are you a free speech absolutist? Well, I don't think you should lie in court. Yes. But other than that, I have a right to say horrible things. Yeah. Okay. And you can just, you can just say, we're not going to talk to him anymore. I don't, I don't, I'm against inciting violence. I do. Yes. I agree. I agree with that. I agree with whatever the yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. Free speech absolutist. You don't incite violence, but you can hold the the only speech worth protecting is the stuff that all of us go, what the hell is wrong with him? You know, you don't have to protect the speech that everybody is in agreement with, you know. And so I just have a, I just like to hear your philosophical view on you have the right to disassociate. Yeah, I think freedom association is an important part of the puzzle. And when it comes to artists, if I'm not going to, I'm still going to listen to Kanye West, but there are artists, if I thought that by listening to them, they were getting my money, and that was helping them continue of nefarious behavior, I would draw the line. Right. And there is a person as a person. I think on the, on the freedom of speech, this doesn't really apply to Kanye, but what I've found is that usually if people want you to shut up, it's because you've got there's something about what you're saying is true, because if it wasn't true, it wouldn't, it wouldn't be a threat to them. So I found that a lot of people want me to shut up. And that's if it wasn't true that let's say on the hill I died on, which was, Yeah, you know. And you know, and, and, and the BLM riots and the deaths going on, and then the federal buildings being burned down, I wouldn't be a threat to them. They wouldn't need to shut me up. So actually, to take that thinking a step further forward, if you, and by the way, conservatives do this as well, everyone does this. If you want someone to shut up, actually, the best way to do it is to deal with what they're saying, the part of which of what they're saying, which is true, and actually confront it head on, instead of ignoring it, is if you ignore it, just turns into a bigger issue, and then more nefarious people, people with can, can take it on and do more damage with it, you have to deal with the difficult stuff. So that's not exactly an answer to your question, but I'm certainly a free speech absolutist. But with free speech comes the responsibility to confront the difficult issues. Yes. Totally. All of our rights have huge responsibilities. And we've, we don't want it doesn't seem like we want those responsibilities anymore. You know, we just, no, just tell me what to say. Tell me where to work. Tell me what to eat. Tell me how my temperature should be in my house. And I'm fine. Go to that sometime. I think we all are. I think we all are. You dated Katy Perry for a while. No, no, no, you didn't. Really? I mean, I'm sure I have it in my research. But I just wanted to know, because I mean, if you were dating, it was, was it the English accent? I met, she's one for women. Sorry, it was presented in what I read as you hooked up. Let's not get into details. Okay. All right. Okay. All right. But she's very smart woman. So is it the English accent or is it the banjo that, you know, she's thought, I got to hook up with, because you were right here onto the, onto the show, I couldn't possibly speak for. No, they will. I would surprise if she remembers me. I was just sick. You were voted the six worst dressed man. Oh, you got some great facts. Wonderful. Yes, I was six, worst dressed man by GQ and I want to hear, I'm not quite comparable quite what year, but that was a very proud moment for me. Hopefully things have changed a little bit. Yeah, a little bit. I put on a similar way. So the podcast, what do you have coming up? Who do you want? Who's like, I tell you what, I very, I'd love to get, what's his Shane Gillis, right? He's a American comedian and I just, I love this guy. He's still a new stand up and this is on YouTube and he's just making me, he's got, he also does a sketch show on YouTube and he's got this one, he's got some very funny one about Trump doing speed dating. He does a great Trump impersonation and he also does a great one about a car salesman who surname is Isis and he's, he was actually cast in SNL and then the SNL sacked him before he even really got started because they dug up in his podcast some things they deemed, had, you know, offended the progressive mind. But I think he's one of the great comedians in America at the moment. So I'd love to get this guy and there's another woman, which again, I think you should get her, is Mazi Alinajad who is an Iranian dissident because what's going on in Iran, if we took people care about free speech, people care about women's rights, let's look at Iran. It's another place where nobody is paying attention and I mean, I saw the Iranian people out with rocks coming after the people with machine guns and I know who's going to win there, at least in the short term. Those people are brave, really brave and kids are being really brave and not getting the attention they deserve. Absolutely and women, it's to be a woman there and with the decades of suppression to stand up to take off their burkas and to stand up to these tyrannical clerics. And there's these countless videos, it's just so moving but it's become bloody and it's very sad and one can only hope that freedom comes to Iran. I have something for you to do. This is a rare opportunity had these for a while. I thought this would be a good time to break them out. This is exciting. These are from 1760 and they are toasting glasses for the coronation of King George III. You lost King. And I thought since you have, I don't have any champagne or anything. I thought they haven't been used. I don't know how long but thank you. I thought we could toast your new king. You got to love him, right? I'm going to toast to the last king of England. We just toasted the last queen. The last queen. She was great. Well, then we shouldn't toast when it's non-alcoholic but we certainly raise our glasses. See, you were brought up in one of those fancy schools where you were just like it's beer. That's incredible. Thank you. Yeah. I'm going to treat you to the queen. These were sent over from the king to somebody here in America in the founding era. Somebody was a very loyal British subject. So they could toast his coronation. Wow. And where did you find them? Some friends found them for me. Yeah. You've got a great collection. Yeah. It's pretty impressive. Yeah. It's pretty eclectic. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm going to dig into your museum after this because I want to get a photograph of that Beno costume. And we've got a lot of stuff that shows how crappy the kings were over in England. We want to go there, do we? I know you guys like to think it was your independence. Right. But actually it was us who agreed on the burden of colonies across the sea. So yeah, we celebrate. Well, one of these days and perhaps with King Charles on the throne, soon you'll recognize King Thing, not a good idea. Although... You're so wrong, Glenn. The problem you got here in America is you don't have a king. Because everything's at the feet of your president. Now the king stands above it all, represents the people. Oh yeah, he does. Yes, he does. And he's linked to God. So whoever you elect, you're laughing at me, Glenn. Oh no. I wish this was those. He has to explain himself to the monarch. But here you just have Biden, who he is planning himself to running riot. Probably George Soros at this point. Well, I think we're an economic forum. If he had to explain himself to someone, he had to put himself below someone. Perhaps we might be in a better place. See, we used to think, and we don't anymore, we used to think no king but God. Yeah. And that's the problem. You don't really have the God thing over in England. And... What do you mean we don't have the God thing? You're pretty lost on God over there, aren't you? I mean, I know you grew up. Well, King Charles is the head of the... I know, I'm very good. No, you're right that we've lost... You're not as bad as Europe. I mean, Europe is. Why should Godless animals over there? Well, Glenn, I think we could talk about the Europeans. But instead, why don't we pray for them? Yes, yes, we shall. We'll pray for the Europeans that they find God. Thank you so much for coming on. It's been a pleasure. Thank you for having me. God bless.
