    "text": " You're a man of action. You live life to the fullest. Embrace your fears. And boldly charge your own path. When life knocks you down, you get back up one more time, every time. You are not easily deterred or defeated. Rugged, resilient, strong. This is your life. This is who you are. This is who you will become. At the end of the day, and after all is said and done, you can call yourself a man. Here for talk, let's go to our man. Good to see you again. Good to see you, man. We have a good weekend. Yeah, that's pretty good. Just have some family in town. Then we had John Lvel with Warrior Poet Society come into town. Him and his wife and his two boys came, and that was awesome. And then we got more family in town this week, so it's just been a revolving door around here. Which is good. We like it that way. And I love, I saw him on your Instagram, I think you're making some posts. Is he, you guys doing some podcast recording, or is he just visiting me? Really why he came up here? He just came up here to enjoy. We had a good time and just spent two or three days up here just like detaching a little bit, which was nice. But yeah, I mean, we can't go without recording a podcast or doing some video between him and me. It's like, it's not going to happen. So we got it done, man. For sure. For sure. Yeah. I love it, man. Yeah. How about you? Cool. Same. Actually, disconnected, took the family. We went down in your neck of the woods. Oh, that's right. I remember. Yeah. Over north of Virgin in Colob area. And my wife's family has a cabin up there. It's amazing. Off-grid, off-grid camping. So it was good times. Cool, man. Well, let's get into it today. I know we got a lot of questions. I think these are questions from a week or two ago. We wanted to finish these up before we solicited any others to make sure we can. It's always cool when we have a guy who shares on Instagram or Facebook and says, like a screenshot on Instagram, for example, that they're excited. We answered their question. They never said if we did a good job or not, but they're excited about it. So that's kind of cool. Yeah. They're like, they're listening to me. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yep. So anyway, some questions. You can, well, we'll solicit more next week, but you can probably do that on Instagram at Ryan Mickler's, the best place to do that. Yep. And these questions we're fielding from Facebook, from the Facebook group, Facebook.com slash group slash order of man. If you want to join us there. All right. Jason Bailey, I love some advice and dealing with in-laws who are not respectful for my wife, for my family's wishes. They are causing stress for both my wife and I. However, they are family. I've asked my wife to set some boundaries for herself, but she is incapable of doing so. How do I establish them for my family without causing an all out emotional and high rate, which causes even more stress? Yeah. I mean, you hit on it. The very first thing you're going to need to do is you're going to need to get on the same page with your wife. And I'm not talking about paying at lip service. I'm talking about she's willing to follow through on the boundaries and the expectations that you have, the way that you're in-laws, her folks are to show up. And if you can't do that, nothing else matters. There's no boundary you can set, no conversation you can have. If she's stepping over your toes every time because she's uncomfortable or maybe she doesn't agree with the expectations or boundaries that you have. So, yeah, you and her really need to sit down and have these conversations. If she has a hard time upholding them, maybe there's some things that you can put in place or at least let her know that you can do that. You can play the bad guy, but she has to support you. Yeah. She has to be there for you. She has to back you up because guess what mom's going to do? When she doesn't like what you have to say, she's going to go out to daughter and they're going to talk about you because that's life. So, unless your wife is willing to support you through her words and her behavior and her actions, nothing else is going to matter. So, that's what I would suggest. That's not an easy thing to do because it's her family. She might feel uncomfortable the way that she was raised, the environment that she learned from is that not you. So, it's going to be challenging, but I don't know what to tell you. It's just you have to have those conversations. That's what happened. It has to because if you try to circumvent any of that, it's not going to work. It's only going to elude it to it. It's only going to get better. Yeah, you're going to be a false guy. It's not going to be better. Yeah. Get on the same page with her. Talk with her. Try to understand. Okay, why does she feel like this? Why is it hard for her to uphold those boundaries and those expectations and start moving in the right direction? It doesn't have to be everything right now, but maybe there's some little micro battles that you guys can discuss and that she does feel completely comfortable with. And that's the win for now. Not that everything needs to be solved at once, but hey, and I'm just making something up. Our kids don't need sweets, for example. Again, I'm just making something up, but grandma and grandma, grandma and grandpa give them sweets. Well, maybe your wife and you can get on the same page about that. There's other things you can't completely get on the same page, but that, yes, you definitely can. And so you're moving the needle in the right direction. And if they don't want, look, if you're in laws, those are your children, not your in-laws children. So if you're in laws, don't respect those boundaries. For me, my simple thing is you don't get to spend time with them. So you can shoot, this is your choice. This is not my choice. Here's what I expect. Here's the boundaries. Here's what we have in place. You can honor that. And if you don't, you don't get to spend time with them. Which one would you like? You would rather feed them candy and sugar and everything else or not spend time with them. That's the two choices. Yeah. I'm wondering too, if when people hear like establishing boundaries with the in-laws, we jump to the Hey, you can't don't do this. You know, like it's, it's kind of like a unpleasant conversation. And I, and I do think that we can be packed full with it. Yeah. Like explain why it's important to us. Enroll them in like why this boundary is important. And so they fully understand you can even be creative and get their input and saying, Hey, here's, here's something we are kids are eating really highly. We, we are kids are eating really highly unhealthy. We, we want to, you know, stop that. We want to promote a healthy living. One thing that we had in mind is no sweets. Is there, you know, would does that what you guys think are maybe only household or only homemade desserts or no, can't like, there's some strategy. Right. And I, and I think if you, if you make it black and white, it's going to always be a little bit more difficult conversation and there might be some tactics that you can have around. How do you establish those boundaries with the end laws? I mean, ultimately it's your call, right? And you need to like own that, but in the same breath, like I think there's some, I don't know, there's some tactics that we could take on the conversation to kind of ease it. I think so, but I mean more towards you're going to do it the way I do it or not. I know I saw this, I saw the smile on your face. I'm like, yeah, Ryan's like, no, hell no. The sound is, I'm just not going to go to my in laws and say, you know, what do you think we could do? Yeah. No, that's not, I'm, no, it doesn't work out. No, explaining yourself. I think that's important. Hey, this is the reason we're doing it because I do believe you want to get buy in. And if they have the why, I think we talked about this last week, then it's more likely they're going to respect and honor that as opposed to just like, do it this way. Just like children, it's the old, because I said so. Yeah. And that only works for so long. You got to explain the reasoning and the meaning behind it. Yeah. And I see some drawback to it too, right? Like they could bulldoze you if they're that those kind of in laws, you're like, you enroll them in the idea or the sausage making and they're like, no, I think this and then they just bulldoze the idea versus you telling them what is so. So I get you. I'm picking up where you're throwing down. I think I think there's, there's merit to both of our approaches and you have to walk that line a little bit. And by the way, you also have to walk that line with your wife because she might not understand why you want to implement this. You want to implement this certain thing. And she might think that you just want to keep the kids away from the grandparents, which is not entirely true, of course. But you're going to have to explain why this is important to you. And there might be some things that are very important to you that aren't important to her and vice versa. So you got to talk about these things. And this is an ongoing conversation, but at the end of the day, it's expectations boundaries, making sure she's on your side and giving her. I should say arming her with what she needs. I'm talking about your wife to uphold the boundary because you can do it. No problem. She's going to have an infinitely harder time doing it. Yeah, for sure. All right, George Sykes, old time listener. Hey, George. How's it going? How do you see the results of the current culture we're going in the next five years? I mean, it's such a broad question. And, and I, of course, I can't predict what's going to happen. But I do believe it's a pendulum. It's going to swing back and forth and back and forth. But I'll tell you what, lefties, and I don't want that to be confused with liberals because I have liberal friends who, although I don't agree with them politically on a lot of things, they're saying rational people still. Yeah, you can still converse with them. You can still spend time with them. But these hard work lefties still happen. Yes, of course. I'll tell you what, though, for all their faults, these hardcore lefties are they live by their convictions. So they're willing to risk offending people. They're willing to get up in their face literally and figuratively when they get elected or they have elected officials. They're willing to push hard on them to push for reform and conservatives don't do that. Yeah, conservative, especially conservative politicians, their cowards, their weaklings. They get elected, they get into office, they have control of the House and the Senate, even the presidency. And yet nothing gets done because they're more worried about getting elected or looking like not the bad guy. And so I think conservatives end up playing the defense a lot and your lefties play hard, hard, ruthless offense. And unless the conservative side of the spectrum can learn to play offense as well as these lefties have, you're just not going to see a whole lot of shift in culture and it's going to continue to fall down this path of degeneracy and it's going to get worse and we're going to see more violence. We're going to see more pitting of races against each other and classes against each other. And then you're going to see more of this gender type stuff and it's going to be perpetuated in the medical community more so in the schools and it's going to get worse. And we need to step up. We need to say enough is enough. We're not playing this game. And when we elect politicians and officials, then we expect them to do these things in order to secure our beliefs and our freedoms and the way that we see the world. And so I hope that we can do that. I think there's a swell of individuals who believe in more traditional values. And so I hope that happens. I don't know. I don't have a crystal ball, but it's a very, well, I think that's why this movement is so important. You know, we're talking about a lot of traditional masculine values, family values, societal values. And this is why we have these conversations and the more people that we reach, the better off we are. So. Unless we are willing to do something about it and stop talking about the silent majority and I hear people say, no, no things ever going to happen. Like the Second Amendment rights, for example, as somebody said the other day, because I made a post about firearms and Biden's executive orders. And somebody said, well, you know, it needs a two thirds majority in the Senate and this and that. And he went through the legal ramifications of appealing the Second Amendment. Like, look, buddy, that's not how this is going to happen. Because if anybody wanted, if any party wanted to appeal the Second Amendment, we would all know we'd be onto it and we'd put an end to it. It's not how it's going to happen. It's going to happen through continual legislation banning certain modifications and things like that to firearms themselves, certain types of firearms, the new director of the, the ATF or as Biden refers to as the AFT. He said something to the effect of, of play and I'm paraphrasing here, but placing AR-15s in the same category as machine guns. This is how they're going to do it. Yeah. It's going to tax it. They're going to restrict it. It's they're not going to appeal the Second Amendment. They're going to tax. They're going to restrict. They're going to tie it up with red tape and all of this other stuff. That's how that's that's the assault. That's the, the attack on the Second Amendment. It's not directly at it. They're flanking it. So we need to be prepared. And when we elect officials, we will hold them to and expect them to represent us effectively, but they haven't done it. So that makes me nervous. Yeah. Yeah. Tyler stick. Do you attend church and what are your thoughts on church? I personally, I'm personally a Christian and I've attended church most of my life, but I'm really starting to question organized religion, especially with how badly so many churches have rolled over to the modern day culture and the COVID shutdowns. I'm considering leaving church building and just having Bible studies from home and opening my door to whoever is interested in joining. So this is probably not going to be as popular of answer that maybe it was 20, 30, 40 years ago. Yeah. I'm a religious person. I'm a Christian. And I also think church is a good thing. Now, I've noticed there's a growing swell and trend of those who say organized religion is bad and it's wrong and more harm has been done than good by organized religion. And I can go up into the mountains and find God more so than I can in a building. I hear all of this and I actually understand it. I get it. I can empathize to a degree with what these individuals are saying. Sometimes when somebody says, well, you know, this is where I find God. Sometimes I think, okay, well, that's just a little bit of a cop out because you happen to want to go camping. Right. So, but I can't, but I can't measure your heart. We've all tried this. Yeah, sure. But I can't measure your heart. I don't know. Maybe you're being genuine about it, but that's kind of how I see it. Now that said, I think organized religion is important. Just like, just like sports. You know, you might know the plays and you might really like football and you might know how to, how to win and how to execute the plays, but unless you go to practice and you congregate together and you work through the plays together. And there's a coach and there's a purpose and there's an agenda that you follow. You're just not going to be as effective as if you just kind of showed up for the game whenever the game was. And that's how I view church. It's an opportunity for people who are like minded to get together to hear from people who are reading the same things that they're reading to congregate to stand shoulder to shoulder next to people who are on the exact same page to be reminded of the covenants that you've made. The commitments that you've that you want to continue to adhere to to repent in an organized structure in an organized way so that actually gets done as effectively. Now, you could go to a church and not feel that and in that case I'd say, well, maybe that's not the church. You know, maybe and what I mean by that is not not the church for you. Maybe there's a different church that would feel that would help you feel more of that. But yeah, I think organized religion is a great thing. And as I continue to see the dismantling of religion and specifically organized religion, where are you going to go to. To learn these values, these Christian principles and where you're going to go to congregate and where you're going to go to teach your children what is right and wrong in this this idea and concept of objective morality derived from God. Like that's why we go to church to be reminded of the things that we say we want to do. And yes, you can get that stuff outside of church and you should be getting that outside of church. You should be doing Bible study. You should be talking with other Christian men. They should be in your band of brothers. You should be playing basketball together and going on hunts together and spending time together. You should be doing all of that. But I think that there's value in having time that is set aside in its deliberate and its intentional and it's focused. And that's what makes it much more effective. That's what I think about organized religion. I just as a thought to because we've ran into this. I'm sure you've seen this too, where we've heard people like, oh, moved to this neighborhood and everyone's like no one's reached out or I go to church and people aren't very welcoming. And like so be that, right? Like we talk about it even in the iron council. Like you be that person to create that. You be the individual to help drive that. So if you happen to go to a church and there's only one church in your area and you go there and you're not digging it. Then show up in a way that you inspire other people on how to fellowship other individuals. Be that light. Be the guy that actually shares the testimony and is open and sharing about where they've been and where they're going and the importance of certain things like be that individual for other people then if you're not getting it. Yeah, I mean, I completely agree. I talked about this on the Friday field notes, whether it's church or trying to find a band of brothers or getting a job. Like nobody's going to trip over themselves to make you feel welcome or special or important or whatever it is you're after, but you can assert yourself. Yeah, if you want a mentor, you can go find a mentor. If you want people to be welcoming you to you, just go out and be upfront. Like go you go meet me. You move to a new neighborhood. Don't wait for somebody to come to you. Go around all your neighbors and introduce yourself. Hey, I just moved here. I thought I'd introduce myself. That's a way better way to approach life, let alone church and mentorship and neighbors than just waiting and hoping that somebody will at some point give you what you think you deserve or need. It's a very passive way to live life and it's just not going to be productive for you. Yeah. All right, Jessen Darrow. I have two daughters that are still living with my wife and I. The oldest loves going outdoors with me and my youngest daughter just wants to stay glued to her computer and cell phone. I'm trying to get her more interested in the outdoors. If I try to force her, it's just turns into a fight. Then everyone is miserable. What are some ways you could suggest getting my city dwelling child offline and into the woods? Well, look, maybe the woods aren't her thing and that's okay. I actually think that's okay. Why? Why? Why does she need to be as into it as you? But maybe there's something else she's interested in that's not her devices that you could actually be interested in and you can foster that. Maybe it's painting. Maybe it's art. Maybe it's dance. Maybe it's sports. Maybe it's shooting. I don't know. There's a million other things that it could be. And I would suggest that you attempt to take some interest in those things. And you might find that it's not a headache, that it's not a battle to get her to go to jujitsu or art class or dance lessons. But I think you're trying to at this point, and I don't know. I've got to fill in the blanks with just my assumptions. I think what you're trying to do potentially is take a round peg and put it into a square hole. Yeah. I'm assuming the primary objective is get her off herself on a computer. Sure. Which could be addressed by any of these other things. Yeah. And look, there's going to be times where, yeah, we're all going on a camp out as a family, so you're going to come with us. But if she knows that what is important to her is also important to you, that might alleviate some of the battle that ensues when you ask her to go do these things. I just, I think there might be some room to be interested in what she's interested in. And that might open up a whole world of possibilities and a new attitude about trying new things and experimenting and making sacrifices for the family. That's important. You know, I do things that I'm not always really that interested in. My wife does the same. My kids do the same because we're, we're a unit, we're part of the family. And that's how it takes place sometimes. So I would look for interest of hers. And you'll hear it. She'll give you clues. And sometimes we just brush it off. Like, Oh, that's silly. Oh, that's not important. Listen, listen very carefully, because they will give you clues. They'll tell you about this cool thing, especially if she's on her devices. She'll tell you about this cool thing that she saw or this cool thing that somebody did or listen, listen. She's going to give you clues. And it's your job to hone in on those. And then to actually nurture those so that she feels cared for and loved and appreciated and part of the family. Joseph de Roma, what should be our focus this decade for elevating the collective consciousness of men to reduce the exploding statistics of suicide, domestic violence, addiction, and jail population. And what was a lot of jail population. Yeah. What should be our focus? Yeah, I would say. I'd say sovereignty. The more that an individual is going to take control of their own life and stop blaming other people and outside circumstances and begin to move the needle in the right direction, the better off they're going to be and the more equipped they're going to be to serve others. Start taking responsibility. If you see a family member that's struggling, reach out to that individual and invite them into your circle. By the way, you don't go to their circle. They come to your circle. A lot of guys don't know that because I get a lot of messages from men who think they want to help their cousin or their brother or whoever it might be. I'm just telling you, you bring them into the fold, not go into their circle because it's not going to work like that. You need to get them out of that environment. So you bring them into your circle. And then you teach them responsibility. You teach them ownership. You teach them what it means to be sovereign. You call them out when they start to blame their poor performance on other people or outside circumstances in situations. And you also have to connect the dots as to why it's so important. And what's the value from it? Because sometimes if somebody's never been introduced to any form of responsibility, that's burdensome. Yeah, just looks like work. I have to do chores and work and everything in my life is my fault. No, thank you. So you have to connect the dots and tell them why this is so important. What are you after? What are your goals? What are your ambitions? How can you be better tomorrow than you are today? And how is that going to feel when you accomplish that thing? You show them the path and let them know that those two are directly correlated. If you want to feel better about yourself, then responsibility is the way to do that. But I think that's the foundation of what we need to be thinking about. I think this gentleman said over the next decade, forever. I think that's the foundation. It always has been. I believe it always will be. As part of the reason we see so many problems in culture today is nobody's taking responsibility for anything. Oh, it's this people. Oh, it's that people. Oh, it's my ancestors. Oh, it's the president. It's the economy. It's my boss. It's my wife. It's this. It's that. And then they also because of that, they think the world revolves around them. I remember vividly my mom telling me the world doesn't revolve around you as a child. I'd be thrown a temper tantrum or being upset about something I shouldn't have been upset about. And she would vividly remember. She would say, the world doesn't revolve around you. And that's an important message that people need to hear. It's not about you. In fact, it's rarely about you. It shouldn't be about you. Especially as men shouldn't be about me. I take care of myself so that I can more effectively serve other people. It's about turning it outwards and serving other people. So responsibility and understanding that the world doesn't revolve around you. It doesn't owe you shit that nobody's going to hand you anything like we talked about in a previous question. And that it's on you. And that's actually very empowering. And that's the first time somebody might ever hear that. Hey, you know what? Yeah, you're in a shitty situation right now. But guess what? You're powerful enough to do something about it. That's the first time somebody may have ever heard that. Because they've been shit on their entire life. Mom and dad are out of the picture. They get around a group of people that aren't positive and powerful influences in their life. And they just think they're losers because everything has pointed to that. And then you come along and you say, no, you know what? Yeah, you have some bad circumstances. Some things are crappy in your life. But you are powerful enough to create that environment. So you're surely powerful enough to recreate a new environment. It's going to take some time. But that's an empowering message. And that's the message people need to hear. That's the responsibility message. Not you're going to have to do a lot of work and it's going to suck. But hey, when you take this upon your shoulders, I want you to know how powerful you're going to feel to create an environment around you that foster success. That's an empowering message. Yeah. And it comes with fulfillment. Of course. And a sense of probably happiness that transcends anything that they were slightly getting out of their current state of being. Yeah, I mean, look, if you're going to get lost in a bottle or lost on some pills or lost in pornography or lost in any number of things that could potentially sedate you, that's going to feel good for a minute. If it didn't, you wouldn't do it. So let's acknowledge the fact that sure, it's going to feel good. But there's greater satisfaction and pride and fulfillment that comes in delaying that for just a little bit and then having a real experience. Yeah. That's a hard sell if nobody's ever heard that, but that's why it's got to be framed in an empowering message. Yeah. For more details on sovereignty, look up Mr. Mickler's book. Is that something we can that listeners can purchase from the store as well? Occasionally Amazon or Barnes and Noble. If you don't want to shop on Amazon, I have a lot of people that don't want to, which is fine. Barnes and Noble, other bookstores. And occasionally we'll get some in the store and those are signed copies, but I don't have them always in the store. That's just case by case basis. So just stay tuned. Okay. Warren Taylor, what are your best tips for being present, being a present father while being away for extended periods of time? I'm currently across the country attending the US Army Drill Sergeant Academy, while my wife stays at home in Washington continuing to work full time to take care of our daughters, our house, our pets and preparing our house to be sold. I really appreciate the work you gentlemen are doing. Hope you are both doing well. Yeah. Well, thank you for your service. First and foremost, because I know that can be a challenging thing. What I would say is try to create some sort of a schedule with communication as best you can. I know the schedule is probably a little sporadic and I don't know how often you can call in and things like that. But I would make that a special time so that the family begins to acknowledge it and be excited about it. Oh, we get to talk to dad today. I get to talk to my husband today. And so there's almost a ritual around 7 p.m. every night or 7 p.m. on Monday and Thursday is when we get to hear from dad. And when you're doing that, that's the moments that you're going to be fully present. All right. So you're going to put the phone away. You're going to turn off the schooling that you're involved with right now. And you're just going to be there. You're going to ask questions. You're going to be fully engaged with them, but creating a ritual around those types of things. I think it's going to be a valuable thing. The other thing I think would be good is to sporadically let them know that you're thinking about them. So instead of a phone call on Monday at 7 like you're scheduled, you should do that still. Wouldn't it be cool if they got a letter in the mail on Tuesday afternoon that was just kind of random from dad that just explained what it is you were doing and what you were up to and you were thinking about them? Or that your wife on Thursday at 9 a.m. got a bouquet of flowers delivered to her. I mean, that's going to go a very, very long way. So you create these ritualized events. And then you create the sporadic events in between. And the cool thing about the sporadic events is you can schedule them, but they don't know they're scheduled. Yeah. Right. So like you might say, okay, when I'm done with instruction, every Tuesday night is when I write a letter and then I drop it in the mail. That's a schedule for you because that's when you can do it, but it's random for them. You can schedule bouquet of flowers to come in three or four days or even next week. Random to them, scheduled to you. And that's what you have to do when you have a weird schedule, whether it's military service or guys working in the oil field, for example, or swing shifts. Okay, you can schedule all that sporadic type interaction. They don't know it is, but you do. Yeah. I like it. Andrew sprinkle, creating your own path for climbing the ladder at work. Thank you, Ryan and Kip. Always enjoyed the discussions. I don't really know what the question is there's creating your own path to climb the ladder at work. Yeah. Maybe some strategy around how to move up the company or corporate ladder. Yeah, I think humility is important. You know, if you have that desire, I think ego gets in the way a lot of times. I want to do this. I want to do that. I'm going to railroad and bulldoze everybody in my path. And that's all good. I like that attitude. But also you need a level of humility that says there are people that are further ahead of you or even peers or even maybe even potentially subordinates who might know some things about some areas that you don't know. And that level of humility is going to help you grow the path quicker. I also think it's important to make your objective known to people. I think that's actually a very valuable thing that one done appropriately to let a supervisor know what you're interested in. How is he supposed to read this goes back to our assertiveness? How is that supervisor going to read your mind about what your expectations are? And if you don't communicate the expectations, guess what they're going to do. They're going to jump to conclusions. And maybe they're right or maybe they're wrong. It's hit or miss. It's 5050. So why not lay it out and let people know exactly what you're interested in. And they actually might help you get see the path better than you've seen before. If you're my supervisor, Kip, and I said to you, Hey, you know, Kip, I've only been working here for about six months. But I really see a lot of growth potential in this organization. I'm fully on board. I love what it's doing. And I actually would like to become a supervisor one day. And here's what I'm going to be doing to ensure that's happening. I'm going to show up on time. I'm going to work hard. I'm going to support other people. If I have new ideas or initiatives, I'm going to bring those to you and you can let me know if these are things that we would move forward on or not. But are there some things that you would want to see in me or even just another potential supervisor that would make you feel good about that individual's path? That would be a rad conversation for a supervisor. Yeah, I'd feel awesome if someone said that. I'd be like, Oh, good. You're ambitious. I love it. Yeah. And then follow through consistently because I think what one thing we have a tendency of doing is not seeing the results as quickly as we'd like. So you might say, Well, Ryan, I need you to do X, Y and Z and that's going to show me that you're very interested. And I do it for two weeks. And I'm like, What the hell? Yeah. Why am I promoted? Yeah. Kip hasn't said anything or promoted me or acknowledged me or whatever. Yeah, it's going to take some time. And there is a point where it's too long and you would need to bring something up. Hey, Kip, last year we talked about this and I feel like I've been doing these things and I don't want to jump to conclusions, but I feel like you have some feedback for me. Or is there is there room for growth or is there a transfer that could take place where I might be able to go somewhere else to continue to excel? Again, this is about assertiveness. But yeah, you got to put forth the effort and it's there. The path is there. It just takes a lot of initiative, a lot of assertiveness and consistency over time. Yeah. One thing that I like is where I was actually telling an employee on my team this the other day because we're a consultant. So everything's about our engagement rate with our clients, right? And that's a really important thing. And I was making the point that I, you're going to be more engaged on projects and people will give you opportunities when you're a reliable source. Oh, for sure. We could look in our scenario in in the iron council. And if you say, Hey, Kip, can you do this and I dropped the ball and I dropped the ball, you're going to stop asking. Of course. And then opportunities are no longer there. But even if you give me something and I like deliver and maybe I even deliver on time or a headed schedule or give you like a great product like, Well, that's even better than I imagined. The next time you need help, you're going to go, Oh, I should ask Kip because this is important. And he's reliable. I can rely on him to do something. And so so many opportunities would just present themselves when we are a reliable source and we do quality work. And people, people want help. The problem most of the time that I run into is like, I don't know who, right? Or we need those kind of individuals on our teams that we can rely on. And those are going to present themselves as long as we do the work and we do it on time and we're reliable resources for the team. Yeah. And there's two more things I thought about as you as you were saying that number one is what a lot of guys will at least think they may not vocalize it is. Well, he doesn't pay me to do that. Or that's not that's not my job duty. That's not my job description. Right. Then keep your job forever. Exactly. Yeah. Cool. Just stay in your little box then of what your job description is. And don't ever don't ever get ambitious about getting out of that box because you're not willing to step outside of it. So sometimes it might take you doing some things that you aren't going to be directly compensated for. In order for people to see, Oh, we actually have an asset right here. We ought to utilize this more. The other thing is, let's say in your scenario, Kip, where you're talking about doing things for people or me coming to you and asking you, Hey, can you do this? Can you do this? Can you do this? You as somebody I'm asking should look for trends. So if I continue to ask things about correspondence with people at an Iron Council, there might be an appropriate situation where you come to me and you say, Hey, Ryan, I've noticed over the past six months or eight months or so. You've asked me quite a few times to correspond with some of the guys to host some of the meetings, et cetera, et cetera. And I actually really enjoy doing that. I would like to do that on a more consistent basis. And so I've put together a strategy that every six weeks, I'll host one of the calls. I'll make these posts. I'll communicate with these guys. And of course, you know, I would expect to be compensated fairly for doing that, but I'm going to make sure that any investment you put into me is actually going to be an investment in you and the Iron Council and what we're doing here. And if you came to me and I knew that I was asking you every couple of weeks for things to do, like, Oh, yeah. Actually, that would be a really good idea. And then it would just unload this from my shoulders. And I would be willing to pay you to compensate you to do that. But again, that comes back to the assertiveness that we were talking about earlier, which is the theme of this week's call. For sure. Take initiative, be assertive. You're going to win if you do. For sure. And the last thing that came to mind as you're sharing Ryan is, and it's so critical, is understand the desired outcome. And that's how you win. Right. Like, if you ask me to do something, I could do this specific task. But if I understand the desired outcome, then I can even look for those other opportunities that you presented, right? I could go, Oh, what he wants is this, Hey, Ryan, I have this other idea because now I'm fully engaged and I understand what you're trying to get after. Right. And I, and I've moved beyond just the little individual tasks that you asked me to do. And the sooner that we can get bought into the outcome, then we can be creative with suggestions and ideas. Or if something goes south, I could still provide a solution to you because I know what the desired outcome is. Right. Even if I have to pivot slightly on the actual individual task. Yeah. And if you want more on that information, go back and listen to last week's podcast because we actually talked exactly about that. And we went on and on about about. Taking again, taking that initiative and looking for the result and then providing solutions that may not be within my view. Right. You might have access to information or resources or tools that would help me accomplish whatever it is I want more effectively. But I just can't see it or don't see it because, again, it's not in my window. It's not in my view. Yeah. That makes you value. It makes you invaluable. He's now I realized, Oh, I've got a resource and Kip. And he's bringing something to the table that I can't bring to the table myself. And again, I'm willing to invest in that. Yeah. All right. And I'll say one more thing. I'll say one more thing. Yeah. If over time an organization proves that they're incapable or lack the desire to invest in that, that would be a red flag for me. So just keep that in mind. Yeah. No growth opportunity. You're going to be stagnant. Right. Yeah. Good call. Excuse me. All right. Stephen Jeffers. My steps in is about to leave for the Navy boot camp. What are some things his mom and I can do to support him through boot camp and his and his first commission? I'm trying to think about when I went to basic training. I mean, really, it's kind of hard in basic or boot camp because they don't get. They can't have anything. Yeah. There's nothing that can have. It varies. I think if I remember correctly, basic training for me was 10 weeks, I think. And then I had another eight to 10 weeks of advanced individual training. So it's probably something like that. I don't, I don't actually know the answer to that question, but I was gone for roughly four and a half months or so. Okay. And I couldn't have anything. There's nothing. You can't send me anything. There's nothing I can have. Yeah, nothing. Because everything that I need is provided to me and there's items that we just, we can't possess while we're there. So I think the best thing that you can do is send letters whenever he can call home, which will probably be you and far between as he's going through training. You know, be there, be available, be present. I mean, there's just not a whole lot you can do. Like, there just isn't. So just be there, be supportive. Be proud. I think that's important. Be proud of him. Let him know that you're proud of him and what he's doing and how he's serving. But again, there's just not a whole lot you can do. That's fine. I get it. I get it. As my son gets old, my oldest son gets older. I'm like, man, at some point he's going to leave the nest and how do I maintain relationship and contact and communication with them and will he want to be involved. And I definitely see where you're coming from. But yeah, just do the things you know to do. Send letters, make yourself available for the call times whenever those are available. Don't make him feel bad or guilty. You know, that's one thing I think people like for serving in the military. No, just for being away or, hey, your mom's having a hard time with this. Like, now's not the time to do that. That's not going to make him feel any better saying you're right. Just rotten. She's so depressed because you're gone. And tell your wife, too. Hey, hon, we're not here to complain. We're here to acknowledge him, to be proud of him, letting him know that we're okay because he's probably thinking the same thing as you. How do I support my parents? I've been there and now I'm gone and I know my dad's going to miss me. My mom's going to be all distraught about it. So he's very much thinking the same thing. So you have to let him know that, hey, things are good at home. Mom's good, dad's good. We're all busy. We're active. We're thinking about you all the time. That's, that's just what you do. Yeah. All right, Logan can do so. Can do so. As my daughter is growing up and my wife and I are growing our family, I've been more and more turned on to the idea of homeschooling. However, my wife dismisses the idea when I bring it up to her. Her family is very involved in the public education system and has been for generations. Her father and uncle are school principals and her brother and grandfather are teachers. I've heard them mock homeschooling at family dinners. My question is, what is a good way to help her understand the benefits of homeschooling and help her see as a viable option when there are lots of different opinions in the family? Yeah, I think if you were to come out straight out and say like, hey, this is what we're doing or this is what I want to do. There's going to be a lot of resistance, it sounds like. And so there might be some, some, as Jocka would say, some flanking maneuvers here where you're just gradually introducing some different thoughts or different ideas. Maybe one of your kids is interested in, in, in music, let's say. And so you pick up a guitar or a drum set or whatever it might be and you get them a course online. That could be as simple as something is YouTube. Or maybe there's another app that you can get on your phone. And so you start introducing these extracurricular activities into your learning and the dynamic of the home. And then you, you keep dropping those things in. You know, I would say when you have one of the uncles or fathers, whoever it is talking about how homeschooling is, you know, horrible or mocking or whatever it might be, you say, hey, you know, I could certainly see how you would say that. I've actually seen saw this one article that talked about homeschooling in this way and it was very interesting because X, Y, and Z. And so you don't allow yourself to be railroaded and you actually bring up a really valid point, not to be combative, but just to offer a counter perspective. And if they're going to get snarky with it, I would actually get snarky back. I'd be like, Oh, well, as an educator, I just assumed that you were open to all sorts of learning and objectively looking at what would be the best option for the kids. I would say that if again, if they're going to get snarky back because I like putting people in their place that are willing to do it to you because it's important that you stand up for yourself and talk about these things. So yeah, it's probably going to be a hard thing. Just say, we're going to homeschool. But I think there's different programs and curriculums and extracurricular activities that you can incorporate into the learning process that might gradually over time expand and open up new opportunities. And I know, like, if you think about it, what's the benefit of homeschool? You're in control. Right. So, so Ryan or anyone else can moan and complain that homeschooling is based upon what? Based upon other people. But our version of homeschool is what we decide, right? Not what every other homeschooler decides, right? And what is what is a principal other than a person that helps run a school? The only difference is he's doing it for kids that aren't his. So, like, okay. Well, and he's hamstringed by the curriculum that he has to present as well. Totally. Yeah. Like, you take that same exact principal running in elementary school and you say, hey, you run your own homeschool at the same level and effort that you give your job. Why wouldn't it be superior? Well, and the other thing too that we're actually in a very interesting time with this whole reaction to COVID is that more and more people, of course, are have their kids at home, especially early on in this thing. Yeah. And more people have realized the benefits of having their kids at home, which means that there's going to be more homeschooling opportunities. It's going to become more mainstream. There's more kids in homeschooling environments. There's co-ops that are popping up. And this is going to become more common than it was before. When I was in high school, the homeschool kids were the weirdos. Yeah. But that actually doesn't seem to be the case anymore. It seems that more and more homeschooled kids are actually very well adjusted societally. They're very intelligent. They obviously think different. They, I think for the most part, would adhere to a more traditional approach and value to society. And you're going to see it more. So not only are you going to get the influence of you wanting to do it, your wife's going to start to get the influence of her friends. Oh, well, you know, we homeschooled and we started doing this and we started doing that. And she's going to see that. And sometimes that can be even more powerful than what you say or what you want. Yeah, for sure. For sure. Dan Ray, most essential, unique daily ritual, Mr. Mickler. Most essential. Essential, essential, unique daily ritual. It's the shortcut. Ryan's one thing that makes him be who Ryan Mickler is. Do you have one? Do you have a daily ritual? No, I mean, I do the same things everybody else does. Like, I'm, there's nothing special about anything that I do. I'll, I'll, I continue to say that. I'm not all that unique. I'm not all that special. You know, I, I exercise daily. I plan it. That's important. I plan out every single day. There's not a day that goes by where I do not plan my day. Yeah. Maybe not unique for this culture, right? And for the Order of Man movement. But I still think in the grand scheme of things, that's really unique. Most people don't do that. Maybe, but it isn't all that. It isn't, it just isn't all that special. It's, it's important. It's crucial for me. It isn't all that special or even hard to do is to take five, ten, maybe 15 minutes tops and write down what you want to accomplish and what you want to get done. Outside of that, just, I get a lot of playing in with my kids. That's not ritualized necessarily, but that's something that's important to me on a daily basis, whether it's doing orders with my son or working on the canoe or building Legos with my other kids or exercising with my daughter, whatever. I mean, we always build something like that. We, we wrestle just about every day. We have mats here in the house and we wrestle every single day on those things. Sometimes it's five minutes and sometimes it's an hour. It just varies depending on what we want to do and what else we have going on. I'll tell you one ritual that seems to be increasingly uncommon is dinner with the family. And I know that's going to get harder as my kids get older and they get active in the opposite sacks and they get active in sports. That's going to get harder and harder, but we still sit down every single day as a family at the dining table over a home cooked meal, barring, you know, going to a restaurant together or something like that or a date night. But outside of that, yeah, we're sitting, we're talking, we're conversing, we're eating food that my wife cooked or grew or, or, or had killed. That's, that's, that's an amazing ritual for us. And again, it's increasingly uncommon. Yeah. But outside of that, I mean, I'm just, I'll tell you the thing that I'm good at. The thing that I'm good at is just doing it forever. Like I'm really good at that. If you lock me on to something and I, and I commit to it when I go, I go to reps in every day forever. And, and that is one thing that makes, I don't, I won't say unique, but that is one thing that has afforded me a lot of success in my life. Because again, I don't feel like I'm all that unique. And I think there's people who are significantly more talented, advantaged, connected, etc. than I am. But over time, I can make up for that. Maybe not in a month, maybe not in a year, but over two, three, five years, ten years. Yeah. I can absolutely, absolutely make up for any sort of loss that I was, that I didn't initially have to begin with. Yeah. I like that. There was a quote by Michael Jordan. And I think he said that he's never lost a game. He just ran out of time. Yes. Yeah. And I kind of like that mentality. Like, no, I would have outlasted everybody. Yeah. I just ran out of time. Exactly. Yep. That's exactly right. Rodney Michael, why is competition an essential, an essential to your theory? And I'm assuming why we, why do you bring it? Why do I talk about competition? Yeah, because it makes you better and it shows you what's possible. And then when you do it in a cooperative environment. Right. So if we're talking about jujitsu or competitive sports, it's, it's, it's, it is competition. Yes. But there's another way to look at it. It's actually cooperation. Right. We want to cooperate so much so that we're willing to bring in a third party, a referee or a judge or whoever. We're willing to bring in this third party to make sure that we both adhere to the rules that we agreed upon and to moderate and mediate and make sure we adhere to the standard. We've collectively agreed to bring a third party to hold us accountable to that set of rules or, or guidelines. And so we're cooperating. Right. You're going to make me better. I'm going to make you better. We're going to work in these confines. And if we step out of these confines, we're going to be warned or penalized. And then we get back into it. And so cooperation is, excuse me, competition is extremely valuable. It also, for me, it shows me what's possible because if I see somebody outperforming me. In any facet of life, I don't think that's a threat. I look at it and think, whoa, I didn't even think that was a possibility. I look at this when I see new new moves tried and like X games, right? You see these snowboarders or skateboarders and it's like nobody ever did a quadruple inverted back flip before. And then before you know it, everybody's doing that. Well, why wasn't everybody doing that before? Just for fun. Yeah, because the stakes were high. And to win, I got to try. I got to go the extra inch. I got to go for something that I've never gone before. Yeah. And it fosters creativity because somebody's like, well, like I see a snowboarder do something. I'm like, I, you know, I'm not a snowboarder by any means, but I would say I didn't even know that was possible. I didn't even know a human body could actually do what it is these people are doing. And then it starts to unlock little parts of you. Well, if that guy can do that, I could probably do that. Or at least I could work towards it. So now it fosters ambition and drive and creativity. These are all so powerful and why competition, I think is so important. But what we do is we strip it away because we don't want people to feel bad. Like we think. Yeah. Yeah. But we think I think collectively society believes that kids in particular are going to feel bad to the point where it's going to break them. And I would say that's not true. That's not my experience anyways. And I spent a lot of time coaching young athletes, football, baseball, basketball. And I'll tell you what, even because a lot of the times in these city type leads, these rec leagues, they don't keep score when they're really young because they just, you know, want to learn the fundamentals of the game, which I don't actually think those are the odds with each other. You can learn the fundamentals and still keep score. But I'll tell you what, I've seen five, six, seven year olds that maybe we're not keeping score and they'll come up to me after the game coach. Who won? Yeah, I remember that too. They want to know, you know, or they'll say, Hey, we want, we got two touchdowns. They only got one. Like they don't even know the score, but they know we got two and they only got one. So we won. And so you have a lot of do gooders who I think want to do right, but they're so soft and they're so weak and they're so sensitive. They think that if anybody has a hard time ever, it's going to break and cripple them. And what an individual needs is a little resiliency, but they also need somebody, a coach, somebody in their corner who's saying, Hey, you know what? Yeah, guys, it does suck to lose. And we lost. And they were a better team than us today, which means that we need to go back to the drawing board. And we need to figure out what they did, what we didn't do so that next game we go out there. I mean, I've coached a team where we lost. I think, I remember his baseball and it seemed like there was 11 or 12 games. And we lost all but two. And that was a hard that was a really hard season. It was hard on the kids, not one of them quit. Everybody kept going. Certainly hard on me. I'm like, man, it's, it can't be the kids at this point. It's me. You know, so that was, that was hard on me because I had to, I had to analyze and I actually considered, well, maybe I shouldn't coach. Like, maybe I'm just not a great coach for this. But no, no, that's not it. Like, I just need to get better. And so I spent time learning about how do you drill? How do you coach? I would, I would in baseball games that season, I would watch other coaches and pick up cues from them. I'm like, well, like, he seems to be able to rally his kids. Like, I'm having a hard time doing what's he doing. And I would watch because that feeling of pain and it was painful for me because I don't want these young athletes to have a bad experience. So it was painful for me. But the pain that I endured because of that was actually very serving to me and to the kids that I went on to coach the next year and the next year and the next year and the next year. So I want you to reflect and, and determine what you needed to do to evolve and change as a coach. Yeah. Which that's what each player should be doing individually as well as part of that process. I remember coaching basketball and I did the same thing. In fact, I went to coaches and asked him if I could attend their practices. So I started going to other teams practices to watch what they were doing because we had a losing season as well. I'm thinking, well, what am I doing wrong here? Right? Right. It's got to be me. Like these boys are, you know, like we just keep coming up short. And so I started, you know, kind of grabbing for straws to try to figure out like what we need to do, you know, and it's good to have that same mentality. Yeah. Yeah. That's a healthy approach. So I mean, we could go on and on about this. There's teamwork and, and there's learning how to do it. And how to win well and lose well because both are a skill that needs to be developed. You need to learn how to win well. Yeah. Which means that you need to be, I think it needs to be, you need to be gracious for the team that you actually got to play against. You wouldn't have been able to win if you didn't have a team to play against. And you need to be humble in that. I remember my coach in football and baseball. His name is Matt Labrum. Guys would celebrate. And he would always say act like you've done it before. Act like you're going to do it again. Like it shouldn't be a surprise. He would say it shouldn't be a surprise that we won this game. You shouldn't be overly excited. I mean, you should be happy about it, but you shouldn't be rubbing it into your face like you've never won a baseball game before. Like you're expected to win. So act like champions. Act. You know, so, and then the team work and then how to work with people. I mean, we had some real jerks on our team. And you know what? Like we had to work with them. Because they're not off the team and we're not leaving. So now you have to learn how to work with difficult people. Like there's so, there's so much. And you also have to learn to work against people who are going to cheat. Right? Because you have this third party who comes in and they're trying to mediate. But they're going to miss things. And other teams and other people, including you, are going to try to take advantage of the rules. And you need to learn how to deal with it. Again, my same coach. I learned so much from me. He's been on the podcast before. We would get pissed off at the end of a game like a close game. And we would get pissed off and we'd say, the referee or whatever missed that call. And he would say, it should have been close enough where the referee would actually determine the outcome of the game. What a great point. Like maybe the ref did miss a call, but it's your fault. You even let it get that close that that's what determined the game. So, man, I love competition. There's so much that can be learned from it. So much. Yeah. All right. Next question, Billy. Iron Council, battle simulator. Good question here. Why can a man be motivated to change certain aspects of his life, but not others? For an example, 11 a month or your old alcohol free and going strong. However, I still eat like shit and cried to myself about being overweight. Yeah. I mean, that's because we hear the adages. Like the way you do one thing is the way you do everything. And that's not entirely true. I understand the point of the message. And I've said that before. And in a certain context, it does make total sense. But it is always the case. I mean, how can a guy who's hyper successful at work be such a loser at home? If that's true, wouldn't he be a success anywhere? Look, there's a lot of factors. Okay. There's your personality. There's the temptations that are hard for you versus the things that are not. So maybe alcohol is just not as tempting as food is for you for whatever reason. Maybe that's physiological. That's biology. That's your makeup. Or it could also be an experience. You know, maybe, and I don't know here, but maybe your father was an alcoholic and you saw him abuse your mother and your siblings. And so you're like, I'm not. I'm not touching that. Don't do that. Yeah. Because that guy was an asshole and I'm not doing that. Totally. And maybe alternative to that, maybe the way that your mother showed you love was through food. So she cooked my wife does this. And her mother who's here this week, they do this. They show their love through food. And so they cook these big, beautiful, delicious meals. And so I'm like, well, they're showing their love. And I want to tell, I want to let them know that I appreciate it. You know, so there's so much at play here. That it's hard to just say, well, you know, you just do it. Whatever you do with alcohol, just do it with food. I don't know. I don't know why. But what I do know is that there's going to be things that are more challenging for you than other people and vice versa. And the best thing that you can do is not question why it is the way it is. I wish it wasn't this way. Unfair. Yeah. Let go of the expectation. Yeah. Right. And, and I'll put the caveat in here. When I say why it is, I'm talking about the expectation, like you said, but it is important to ask yourself why. Why is this so difficult for me? Because if you can answer that question, then you can start to put the pieces in place that help you deal with a greater temptation. In this case, then alcohol is for you. Yeah. So maybe it's as simple as we don't eat out. And that's a restriction I put in place. That's a self-imposed limitation. That's discipline, right? Or I'm going to ask my wife not to bring home the chips and salsa when she grocery shops. And that's just something I can't deal with it. Like, I'm not, I'm going to eat it. If it's here, I'm going to eat it. So just please don't bring it home. Right. Or you put time limits on it. And this is one thing I did because I'll tell you what I love to eat eating is my problem too. Chips and salsa specifically. And I love to eat late at night. Like I could sit down. Today, I'll probably won't even have lunch today. Not a big deal. I don't eat breakfast. Probably won't have lunch. I'll have dinner with the family. But then like at night after the kids go down, my wife and I are relaxing. It's like munchy time. I'm going to go have sandwich. I'm going to get the chips and salsa. I'm going to eat everything in sight. I'm going to make some burritos and do some tequitos and like all the good stuff, right? And all of it. I cannot contain myself. And so I've, I put restrictions in place. Hey, man, you don't eat after seven o'clock. You just don't. Not one chip, not an M&M, not no. You don't eat after seven. And that's the restriction I've put in place because that's where I get myself into trouble. And that's me personally. It might not be you. So figure out why it is you do that. Put the things in place to ensure you don't do that and then measure it. And see where you fall short. Like it's important. Like for me, eating late. Okay. I found that out over time. Like I get in trouble when I eat late. I need to know that. I need to identify. That's the enemy for me. So I need to identify that. Maybe it's something else for you. Maybe when you're stressed out. Or maybe when you're, you're, you're tired, you know, but you're so stressed and anxious. And so you eat. Or maybe it's when you're with friends and you're celebrating that, like, that's when you eat the most. Figure out when there's some, there's a couple of great books. There's the power of habit by Charles Duhake. And then there's atomic habits by James Clear. And one of the things that James Clear talks a lot about is he talks about friction. And he says, one of the things that you want to do with the habits you're trying to eliminate and get rid of is create friction. So we'll go back to chips and salsa. I need to make it harder to get chips and salsa. That's the friction. Because if it's harder, I'm lazy. All of us are. If it's harder, I won't do it. And I need to make it easier. I can't remember the term he uses, but less friction for the things I do want to do. Like working out or going to the gym or eating healthier food. And so I make those things more accessible, more in my proximity, even with working out. I've got kettlebells, I've got the war clubs, I've got things in here that I'm literally using throughout the day because it's right here. It's like, oh, there it is. I got to pick it up and do 10 front squats with that thing. So I hope that helps. Don't focus so much on like, oh, why is, but it is. That's all it is. Now let's figure out why it is that way and come up with a plan to deal with it. Yeah. How much do you think Ryan, you know, like, and maybe it's, I don't know, maybe it's maybe it's not applicable to so much food. But I think of like, vices, you know, let the say like. Cigarette smoking, for instance, and there's, there's a sense of identity, right? Like, like you know, you're not the person to drink to smoke cigarettes. And so to do it is just out of character for you, right? And for us to accept something is like, you know, something against probably what we know is best for us. We had to like accept the idea that I'm not person, that I'm the kind of person that will overeat or I'm the kind of person that will, you know, or that I am an alcoholic. You know what I mean? And I have to accept that as my identity. Am I looking too much into this from like a psychology perspective? But like, I don't know. Do you get what I'm saying? Like, yeah. And I don't know. I don't know from, like you said, psychology perspective. I would never, I would never try to convince you. I'm an insity buddy. I knew that side of things. But anecdotally, I can tell you one, one little story of mine. So this was years ago, I was drinking a ton of monster energy drinks, a ton. Like I have one to two per day. I was just drinking them all the time. And I didn't want to. I wanted to stop drinking energy drinks because I knew they weren't good for me. So I'm like, okay, I'm going to stop these things and I battled with that. Like I couldn't stop drinking them. It was just a habit. And then one day I made a deliberate decision and it was like, it was like this. I said, successful people don't drink monster energy drinks. Now, look, that's actually probably not true. There are probably plenty of successful people who drink monster. It's not true. But I said that to myself. Successful people don't drink monster energy drink. And I have not had one since. In fact, I'm like, oof, I look at them like that looks gross. I don't even want one. I don't know. I don't know. Again, that's just anecdotally. But you know what I mean? Like that that was a shift, right? Yes. That's not because I believed it. I told myself. No, no, if you want to be this person and you do, I want that more than the energy drink, then you're going to be a person. That's what you need to say to yourself. Same thing with smoking. If you're trying to get rid of it, I'm not making light of addiction or anything like that. I'm just saying anecdotally, this worked for me in that situation. Successful people don't drink monster energy drinks. Successful people don't smoke cigarettes. I think there's something to those assertions that you make about yourself. Yeah. When I think and part of that, Ryan, correct me if you agree or let me know if you agree or not is you have to believe it, right? Like I think some of us might be thinking like, you know, in Billy's scenario, you know, like, hey, food's a vice for me. But he may not really be bought into that. He may be saying that because, well, Ryan says that and people say it's important or I should stop smoking because, you know, it's not. It's, you know, socially, but they're not committed to it. Like they're really not bought into why they really should. And I see this a lot with things like 75 Hard, which I know a lot of guys listening have done that or in the process of it, is they'll say things like, you know, I'll start tomorrow or I'll start on Monday. Okay. Well, already, I know that you're not bought into it. Otherwise you do it today. If you do it right now, it was critical. You did it right now. You would start right now. That's a tall sign. That isn't me passing judgment on that. It's just saying, I don't think you're fully committed to it. I don't think you're ready for it. And maybe it works. I'm sure there's people who listen who said, well, I started on Monday and I got through it. And that's great. But I think you're probably the exception rather than the rule. And it's, I think it's, it's harder. Should say it this way. It's easier for you to cop out of it. I think somebody who says, I'll start on Monday and it's Saturday night or Friday night. Like, let me, let me drink everything this weekend and eat everything, you know, in sight. And on Monday, I'll start. I think that person is probably going to, when it gets hard day 10, day 15, day 30, they're going to say, well, you know, I've been, I've been doing really good. So I'm just going to take this weekend as a break. I've been doing good. I'm going to take this weekend as a break. And if you know, 75 Hard, that's not really an option. But that's what people will say. They'll convince themselves. It's just a break. Just, just this weekend. And then I'm going to start back up on Monday. Yeah, because you set the precedent that you could do that. You already set the precedent of how this is going to go down. It's the same thing with marriage. Marriage works the same way. You know, oh, this is hard. Like, I can't do this. And if you've already had a divorce, like we know that the, the likelihood of you getting divorced again are significantly higher if that's the case. Okay. Because you already set the precedent that there's an out. There's an escape hatch. And so you'll use it at the slightest sign of adversity, your challenge or fear. So you got to be careful the precedent you're setting for yourself. Yeah. Mm. All right. Eddie Molina. I'm 42 in the middle of a career transition that I've been researching and planning for several years. I'm not dumb. I'm close to a second master's degree. My current career working with criminals and crazy people have been wearing me down over the years. I am confident in my choice and the new business venture, but my wife isn't. And it's a strain on our marriage. What advice do you have? So it sounds like he's getting away from the criminal side transitioning to a new job and the wife is uncertain. So of course, that's typically going to be the case. I think generally speaking, women are going to be more apprehensive about you moving into a new career path than men. That's a general assumption, just general, general statement there. But I think that's true. That was certainly true of my situation. So what I think you have to do is you have to illustrate and communicate with her ways in which you've taken risk and they've panned out. Other business ventures, other opportunities, other investments that have worked and what you've done. I also think it's a good idea that you come to her with a plan and you communicate that with her. Not to explain yourself in that way, but just to help ease some tensions that, Hey, I'm not. I thought this strategy. Here's the plan. Here's the mentors I'm working with. Here's here's the business. Here's how it works. And then there might be some ways to hedge too. So when I started Order of Man, it wasn't like I just shut off all my income and I went over here. It was, okay, I got all my income here and then I'm going to work a couple hours at night and a couple hours in the morning and I did that for several months. Started making a little money over here while I was still making all the money over here. And I gradually gradually just kind of went like this. This income just gradually reduced because I wasn't in it as much and this income over here started to go up. And even when this was higher than the original income, I just told my wife, I'm going to sell the business and that was even scarier for scary for her, even though the income had already replaced it. And that was a little bit of a backup maybe in her mind. Yeah, like we could fall back on that. Right. So we took months discussing talking, sharing, strategizing, talking about growth over here before. And even as I was signing the papers to sell it, she was still as was I still nervous and apprehensive about selling the business, but you know, we did it. But here's the cool thing about it now. If I told her, hey, hun, I know I've got this order man thing and but I'm going to start another business over here. I'm going to start the side business and here's how it's going to work. She would be less apprehensive about it. She still would be, but less so because she's seen me do it before. And I would, I would communicate that. Hey, you remember how nervous you were about when I was doing the financial planning stuff and I sold the business and grew or remember that. Yeah, I remember that. And that's a very similar situation. So I think you can go back and you can draw upon situations that you've created risk that you've taken that have panned out, communicate the plans and the strategy with her. And then maybe there's some hedging strategy here where it's not putting it all on the line because you could probably do that, but you aren't the only consideration. I believe generally women are less likely to be excited about that as men. Yeah. Michael Chaddell, I have an opportunity. This was the last one, Kip. All right, sounds good. I have an opportunity for a promotion at work, but it would require me to leave the union and go company, which would take away some security I have with a union, but I would make more money and have opportunity for growth. Any advice? No, you already answered your own question. Okay, read that last sentence again. Yeah. I would make more money and have opportunity for growth. You answered your own question. Yeah. Case. Look, I know I get it. Things are comfortable where they are. Now I'm not a huge fan of unions as they are, but let's table that conversation for a minute. It's comfortable. That's the enemy. Okay. Look, one day you're going to die. And it actually might be this afternoon, or it might be in 30 years. We don't know. But one day you're going to die. And you're going to have to, you're going to have to live with the fact that you were willing to just be comfortable, knowing that there could have been something else that you weren't willing to embark on. So let's play this out. Let's say you go start this thing or whatever. I don't know the situation, but let's say you go with the, you start working with the company. And it doesn't work out. Bro, just go back to your union job. Like that job is going to be there. It's going to be there or something else. Will you be fine? It's going to be hard for a year or two. Sure. But it'll be fine. But what if this thing over here actually works out the way you think it could? What then? I think about that when I come out, we've been almost two years here in Maine. And it would have been easier. I could convince myself to stay in Utah and things were just the way they are. And it's fine. And it's good. And that would have been fine. My wife and I decided we're going to move out here. We're going to move the family out here. And the worst case scenario is we come out here and we hate it and we're cold for two years. And then we just move home. That's a pretty good worst case scenario. Yeah. So I'm not going to tell you what to do, but I think you already know what to do. And you're asking a question to, I was going to say talk you. I don't think you're trying to be talked out of it. I think you're trying to be talked into it. And that's not my job. You know what to do. So make your decision. You already answered your question or your answer. Yes. You answered your question in your question. Believe in yourself. Trust yourself. That's your gut speaking. That's that's your belief speaking. The fact that you answered your own question is you. That's that's the belief you have in yourself. Roll with it. Go with it. Well, and it's such a false sense of security anyway. There's no security for sure. Yeah. Yeah. I can't help but and maybe I'm being a little bit mean on the whole union thing but like I'm envisioning a bunch of sheep in a corral down in the valley. And there's this beautiful peak that you could climb as a sheep that's just breathtaking and wonderful. And you get staying that little corral and be safe with all the other sheep because why if a wolf shows up the person. A wolf shows up the probability of you getting killed is really, really low. Right. So you can stay in the corral all you want and probably live for a little bit longer. Or you could take the risk and go up on that mountaintop and live a wonderful life. Right. And run a possible risk if you get eaten by a wolf. Let's say this too. Let's add because I like that analogy. The shepherd is like stay in the corral because you're worth money to the shepherd not because he cares about you. Totally. And I'm going to put a fence up to help you fill that way. Right. That's what I'm saying. Give you the smell. It's not to fill that way to protect my investment. Yeah. Totally. Nothing to do with you. Yeah. It's to protect my investment. To protect me. All right. We're going to say next question. We're going to table that one. We're going to table that one for another day. But that is worthy of a conversation we ought to have. So, anyways, let's have that.
