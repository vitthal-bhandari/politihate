Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucks, sexton show podcast. Our three of clan buck is right now. Thanks for tuning in. Thanks for being here with us on this Friday, March 3rd. I cannot believe we're going to be in the midst of a springtime machine. Especially considering some of the weather. We mentioned this in the last hour, but did you see that some of the snow in California? Oh, yeah. I've never I can't remember ever seeing at least in Los Angeles heavy snow and snow at the Hollywood sign and other places out west have gotten hit with snow. You don't usually see it, but down here in Florida, I don't know. It just it's 75 degrees. It's 70 degrees. You know, there's some variation here too. Little different. A little bit a little bit. How do you think you're going to handle when it's like 90 degrees every day? Because you're I get it. You can talk trash right now. Yep. You've been down there for January, February, March. That is by far the best time to be in south florida, certainly relative to the rest of the country on July 28th when it has been 90 degrees for like, you know, August 28th, whatever it is. How do you think your tender skin, which we have established? You came back from the south pacific without the least bit of a tan. How do you think you're going to handle this? I'll send you a postcard from the coast of Maine is how That's my Twitter does right. You just tucker Carlson like you get set up You can just bounce back and forth between Florida and Maine living the best life It's always perfect weather. It's a good way to do it. It turns out New Hampshire actually has some coastline doesn't get a lot of talk New Hampshire's got coastline. Obviously, Cape Cod, Massachusetts got some lovely coast Long Island out of New York There's some places you can get a little bit a little bit cooler weather with still that that ocean That ocean vibe. So that's something to think about. All right. Let's let's dive into the a couple of things first of all The the big story today that we did in the in the at the top of the show I just want to return to it for a moment here because Cries Jean-Pierre was asked about this And it is that Biden is not going to veto the republicans veto of or I should say the passage of a republican bill that would undo the DC councils Crime bill because the DC council Uh, district of columbia decided they were going to make penalties Less stringent less severe for some very serious crimes even though DC is going through A very rough time With crime right now relative to where it was even three or four years ago Here is Cries Jean-Pierre Asked about this because dammit some far left democrats are very upset about it play clip seven So when it comes to what this proposal brings forth, which is, you know, really lowering penalties for carjacking That's not going to he doesn't believe that's going to keep our community safe. So the if the bill comes, uh, he's going to take action If the bill comes he's going to take action actually there's a little more here too Um, he is going to sign this repeal according to kj kjp play eight This isn't being presented to him on signing this into law And if you look at what is being presented to him the mayor actually disagreed with what the DC council put forward And so now this is an opportunity to protect the community. That's the way the president sees this to protect the community Joe biden this is this is where he is Particularly useful the democrats because remember the biden signing of the crime bill republicans very I think Unwisely attacked him a lot in 2020 on that one the crime bill in the 90s was the thing that biden Is attached to from a legislative perspective? That was good actually that made sense probably his single best decision Ever was to sign on to the 1994 crime bill which put in place Processes which led to rapidly declining rates of violent crime all over the country because we put violent criminals behind bars and kept them there That's something that bill clinton got right. That's something that the republicans got right working together But we talked about this in hour one And I think it's always instructive and important I I sometimes make fun of myself because I read the new york times every day and I read the washington post every day I think it's instructive and important to consider the arguments Not just of people that you agree with I read the wall street journal editorial page And it feels like every morning. I'm like man. They nailed it again, right? Like that's the place I would say where I go most frequently and see what I believe reflected Hopefully in an intelligent fashion. I think that newspaper is the best in the country in my always humble opinion But what does biden run on? He can't run on the border He can't run on crime. This is about trying to take away the republicans ability to run on crime He's probably not going to be able to run on ukraine buck because I think the idea That ukraine even by the time we get into next year's full on political season I don't think you or I believe that the ukraine war against russia is ending anytime soon Uh, he can't run on inflation and i've got another prediction for you if you want to flag this one. I think very soon The biden administration is going to start to say buck here's a prediction as we get into the campaign season and earnest They're going to say you know 2% just a just a target for inflation Three and a half percent inflation is still good four percent inflation is still okay They're going to move the target because I don't think they're going to be able to get inflation down back down to two percent By the time we get into the political campaign and earnest So keep your ears attuned for this argument to begin and earnest of well, you know We were nine and now we're down to four and a half and that's really good And there's not that much difference between three and a half and two or four and two That's where they're headed on the economy and you hit on it because I think If you're the biden team, you have to hope that employment stays unemployment stays low It's around three and a half percent right now And that most people don't recognize that their wage growth is being outpaced by inflation And biden tries to run in 24 buck by saying I got us through covid We're back to normal in this country now. Let me finish the job And the only way I think he argues to finish the job is by trying to hang on to the economy And just argue it's actually good even if many of us out there feel like it's not because to me the move on Crime is just to take down the ability to attack him individually Less on crime because he can say look I added more police officers I gave the uh, I kept dc from making awful decisions And how much of crime is a federal issue as opposed to a mayor or state governor issue I think is a really debatable and intriguing topic Kringes you on pia by the way was also asked about we discussed this yesterday on the show Um biden made this reference to marjorie taylor green accusing him of having blood on his hands Uh in reference to this mother who lost her two sons To opioid overdoses and biden was talking about a marjorie taylor green He kind of he was making fun of her then he laughed about it and it just for a lot of people it just seemed like a really really tone deaf Bizarre and and pretty nasty moment for bide and given the subject matter green jon pia of course saying Oh, it's all just being mischaracterized When it comes to this president, I believe the american people knows who he is Fundamentally because he's been around for some time and they have watched him go through grief They have watched him deal with really personal loss He expressed sympathy for her last night and his heart goes out to any person who has to go through That type of trauma that type of hurt. I will say his words are being mischaracterized by Someone who is regularly discredited for things that she says that are really conspiracy theories And those lies are being parroted by a certain network Can I just say clay that the biggest of the narratives that are constructs about joe biden You know, he's up for the job. There's a whole bunch of things But that he's a really really nice guy Which is something that you'll see everybody in the dc press corps takes that as a given And even people that don't pay much attention to politics. They say joe biden. He's a decent He's an honest decent guy But aside that he lies all the time No, I mean I think when when he was when he was basically cheering for people to get fired from their jobs for not taking the crappy worthless vaccine for example He's a nasty person and the way that when he speaks about election election reform in a place like georgia and refers to it as Jim Crow 2.0 I mean, I think he's a nasty individual I don't think he's this nice guy And I think that when this comes out they have to run cover for him I think you're right and look this is how they won They convinced enough people in the midwest that joe biden was an unthreatening grandfatherly figure and enough people bought that idea When you see him callously disregard a mother who has lost two children to drug abuse and overdose We said yesterday how often have you seen joe biden reference bo biden's death and also talk about his son's addiction You would think that just based on that the idea that he would laugh At and he might say oh, I was laughing at margery taylor green But you listen to that audio maybe we'll play it for you when we come back. We can grab it We played it yesterday To me it sounds like he is laughing at the accusation that is made by the mother that he is partly to blame And we talked about this yesterday buck and I was reading in the wall street journal this morning Bill bar has got a fantastic piece about how to deal with drug cartels Built right off of what we were talking about yesterday and bar who is by all intents and purposes very smart man Essentially is saying we have to go to war with these drug cartels And he's specifically referencing everybody that we're losing to uh to death from overdoses And even mare garland earlier this week and his testimony Intimated that mexico was intentionally doing this and certainly there's been a connection to china in the past in terms of how drugs get here I think this is going to turn The the border issue Into one that becomes a top dislevel discussion in 2024 And i'm increasingly of the belief That we're going to have to get supremely aggressive With these cartels because mexico can't do it mexico is basically a kleptocracy These cartels have taken over so much of the mexican governmental Infrastructure that we can't rely on them to be able to do anything I mean they let el chapo before we brought him here buck tunnel his way out I didn't even break out of prison like two or three different twice. Yeah I mean that's a sign of how narco Corrupt mexico is pablo esquibar Famously and for those who yes narco's is a great show, but if you want to read the book mark mark boedans uh killing pablo book is a quick and riveting read uh he also is the author of bla the black hawk down book that the movie is based off of Pablo esquibar was allowed by the columbian government to build his own prison To live in he built his own prison to live it So it would be like you're under house arrest But we don't we don't want to call it that so build yourself a mansion put a fence around it Hire your own guards and that will be your prison and he obviously conducted cartel business and even executions Inside of the prison that he was operating so to give you a sense of how corrupt it can get in these countries Because these guys have more power more money and more influence Than anybody in government or the entirety of the government and that is what we are dealing with with mexico right now No, no mexican who has more power the head of a cinoloa cartel or the mexican president The answer is the head of a cinoloa cartel I agree.

We also have another battle that's continuing Earlier this week buck. We praised the view. I know shocking to me too Dumbest show on television Whoopi golberg was making sense. She came out and said no you can't edit books after authors died to try to make people feel more comfortable I think joy behar came out and said you know what you shouldn't be confronting marjor Taylor green in restaurant She has to be able to go out and he said my goodness. What's happening in the white cats and dog They're clay and buck in the view all conspiring one great message of harmony Unfortunately Days are gone now Her whoopi golberg came out earlier and said yeah, we do need to tear down statues of Abraham Lincoln listen Well that statue was not good enough because it showed a slave down at Lincoln's feet and if we're tearing down statues That are really not in tune with where we are as a nation or at least where we were a couple of months ago Yeah, you gotta take it down. That's why they've removed stuff. That's why people are moving stuff around I got I got a big question for you buck That ties into this so I live on a battlefield basically Franklin, Tennessee for those of you out there who are civil war nerds like me I live November 30th 19 1864 I basically live on a battlefield like right by this battle of franklin here in Tennessee and They had a big controversy because we have a Confederate memorial as you would probably anticipate that we might because of the battlefield And there's this big debate about tearing down statues monuments everything else I actually think franklin did something really good buck. They added a new statue of black soldiers who fought for the north and put it near the town square as well And so the question that I would ask for everybody out there is Why don't we add more history? Instead of insisting that we tear parts of history right now that this is important actually there is an impulse That exists on the left to build a new Foundation of america all the time. They want to tear down, but they also want to build their new stuff Right on the right we tend to want to preserve Because we like the foundation of america. We like this country We know it's not perfect But we don't think enough about how do we make our own stuff or new you know add new stuff to to the country now i'm just specifically on the statue whoopi goldberg was referencing there Is a very famous statue because it was built with the donations of former slaves And was dedicated in 1876 former slaves donated money for this statue to be created And frederick douglas himself gave the key note address dedicating this statue unveiling this statue yes, and so i mean a bunch of Leftists are going to tear it down now and destroy it the statue dedicated by frederick douglas And paid for by freed slaves. Yes, that's that's what the left wants. It's pretty amazing to think about it no, it 100 is and the context in which the history is being told matters But we keep talking about history as if there's only so many slices of pie that exist And this is the history nerd in me book, but I know for you too. There's always more you can learn about history So why would we not be it would change the conversation immediately? If instead of trying to tear things down, we talked about adding more context and more historical basis For everything and I think the battle of franklin where i live here in tennessee has actually done a really good job of Providing greater context going forward for what happened in 1864 Did you know that pure talk saves the average size family over? $900 a year when they switch from verizon at and t or t mobile There's a whole lot of family members in this audience who are saving that kind of money this year just from making the switch And they're doing it without sacrificing quality in their service.

They also make some other candies and food products, but Hershey's Was one of these companies that a town was built around the Hershey factory was unincorporated territory And so it really wasn't even just it's it's a long Disney in those lines that it created its own little world And Look, I'm like a liar Like I say I have a chocolate snob Hershey's is okay. I'll eat it You know what a pinch not my favorite chocolate, but it gets it gets it done. What's your favorite chocolate? Oh, man, I that's uh if you know, I actually think Dollars in dollars out and the ease of getting it Lindt chocolate all in it's just the best taste and chocolate you're gonna get and I know all about Valro and mazon do chocolat and all these other things and we can talk about What's up? Giardelli. What do you think about Giardelli? You're deli out of San Francisco It's good It's good. Not my favorite solid. I mean like I'm not putting it down But if you're if you're like if you're somebody who just wants chocolate that tastes like you think it should taste I think that lint gets it done for me. I've never asked you this by the way We're gonna get into this ridiculous Wokeness from Hershey if you're going into a movie theater and you can only get one Snack, what would you get? I can tell you what my two go-tos were as a kid when I used to go to movies and get candy at movies snow caps Sour patch kids Interesting combo. Yeah, what about you? Peanut M&Ms I still get peanut M&Ms when I go now and a lot of times I also get you know pop Kids so like the amount of money it costs me to take the kids to go see I sometimes have been disbelief when we go through the the concession stand I got all three kids We went to go see that superhero movie the ant-man movie recently And I think I spent like $60 and and I don't even know how it's possible With the what this stuff cost and of course when I was a teenager I would just sneak everything in right like you go to the gas station buy whatever you want put it in your pants You know sneak it in but I'm why we talk about Hershey's other than the fact that we like chocolate and and we're getting hungry It's fun to talk about food on a friday Because Hershey's in in preparation for its celebration of international Women's day, which is on march 8th, which I don't even know that women had an international day. I feel like you know Okay, fine. There's international women's day is a thing apparently They have rolled out a series of specific candy bars That are that had the face and the pronouns I believe of the of different women and the the pronouns on one of them is Her Rather the pronouns they put on her her she kind of play on announcing her pronouns and her she chocolates chocolate bars, but what is getting so much attention right now is that one of the women clay is not a woman Ah, it's a transgender woman an activist Named Faye Johnstone And we can hear this is from the ad the rollout of this Her for she hashtag her for she campaign with lgbtq advocate and former male we're told Faye Johnstone play clip one my name is Faye Johnstone. I'm the executive director of wisdom to act then We can create a world where everyone is able to live in public space as they're honest and authentic So see the woman changing how we see the future at Hershey's Canada So they're doing international women's day celebration at Hershey's chocolate company Which has been around for 140 years in america and they're celebrating international women's day by putting a man who now claims to be a woman and Faye his face on the bar and the whole thing. This is this is where we are now with international women's day in corporate america This is a battle that women are going to have to fight at some point Because it's not only that these men are pretending to be women It's that they're immediately adopting the most exaggerated aspects of being a woman and buck I see some of this stuff and Our friend at libs of tiktok will share some of it and I look at it and I just think to myself. This is crazy men who decide to become women Now claim that they have minstrel cramps. Have you seen this stuff? Like it's Crazy. Yeah, I mean we all know that there's this claim that Men can get pregnant, right? I just I don't know How we return to some form of normalcy because when I see this Hershey commercial I think the only way that this ends is if women say this is we're not standing for this anymore Well, I think the first step is we have to say no We we just we have to actually now no more changing the pronouns around no more. Oh, it's just about being polite It's not about being polite. This is a political and cultural Program of authoritarian madness that is affecting children now We just talked about you know gavin new sums upset because tennessee doesn't want Miners to generally mutilate themselves or take puberty blockers Wait, what are the long-term studies in the puberty blockers of the gentle mutilation? Anybody want to guess there are none because we just started doing this like five minutes ago Basically in this country because it's become a fashionable ideology on the left It is now fashionable for libs to do this to their children Which is why you know what you never see you never see two parents who are like, you know traditional traditional You know old school Americans who say yeah, you know, I vote Republican and I've got a trans child It's always You know the parents are announcing their pronouns There's always this you know, oh wait, hold on a second You mean to tell me that there's some influence here from the adults who want to tell us that this comes naturally from the children Anyway, they're telling us now they're trans babies. You know this this is another thing that they say I mean they're trying to do say the doctors get the sex of babies wrong when they're born But but I think what you have to see here with the Hershey ad and everything first of all Hershey's Disney Hershey's think of the great american companies that come to mind that's like oh we all love Disney We all love Hershey's chocolate bars, you know We all love Ford Motor Company or maybe you don't but you know what I mean Like these are the things that you think of iconic american brands Thank you iconic american brands And they're doing this kind of stuff and and you have to understand the reason that the activists left demands Things and pushes things like a a male By the way, even saying biological male. Why do we know it's a male a male a male as the Representative of the Hershey's candy bar For international women's day is that the claim is not This is a person who has a different gender identity So just be nice to this individual and give them the pronouns that they want and treat them with dignity and respect That's the and that was the pitch. Yeah, so that nice people you mean everybody listening this Yeah, we treat people with respect we want to be kind everybody would go along with more and more of this stuff The actual claim clay and people need to understand this and and I know this is crazy it's meant to be crazy is that Faye john stone is a woman A woman with period cramps who can get pregnant who is indistinguishable From other women in our discourse and in our society that is the most obvious of lies Yes, and that's why this is this is We just can't keep doing this can't keep going along with this And I think ultimately for everybody out there, it's going to take women standing up on this because where are the feminists But this is why This is the canary in the coal mine moment that I think it epitomizes things so perfectly sports When you have bigger stronger faster men Who decide to identify as women and then become women sports champions? Which is happening everywhere Your granddaughters your daughters over the next 10 years Are going to be at some point in time based on how things are going in their high school league in their in their maybe even Certainly in college, but I think almost every high school league in america is going to have to grapple with the question of What do we do about people who have decided that they are not the gender they were born and The not the gender that they went through puberty as So you end up with the greatest women's athlete of all time being men South park was on this buck 15 20 years ago making fun of it and how ridiculous it was It's now our reality and it's happening everywhere And you out there all these women are going to have to decide wait a minute I am woman hear me roar or are we just going to let dudes take over Many of the traditional Aspects of being a woman. I mean the I I want women in this audience already know this The demand of the left right now The demand of the apparatus of the dem remember the left in the democrats is one of the same These are synonyms or they're they're that's the same thing um The demand is that if I were to decide tomorrow that I am actually a woman And I grew out my hair and I got prosthetic breasts and and you know put like lip and lip injections into And and I and I put on a dress Within six months maybe within six weeks. It would be appropriate for me To assuming I was pushing the left wing agenda Across the board go give lectures to women on womenhood Yes, and the expectation is that women would clap for me That is what is happening in america today How about Six weeks after you become a woman you could go to the white house dressed as a woman and interview joe biden Because that happened yeah Yeah, and and go around telling everybody about how amazing it is to be a woman and what it's like to be a woman and This is this is offensive. Yes, you know, this is offensive to everybody I mean this is why my wife gets fired up She's like of reality You're going to tell me what it is to be a woman six weeks after you decided that you were a woman when you haven't ever Gone through any of the things that being a woman represents and she gets fired up just talking about hey You never as a as a 16 17 to 18 year old Or older walked through a parking garage afraid that you were going to get raped Like every woman on the planet does you have had no experiences that actually reflect what women go through on a day-to-day Basis and suddenly you're the paragon of femininity, you know, they see where this all goes in canada the teacher With size z prosthetic breasts. Yes a man adult male Walking around with beach balls in a t-shirt pretending to be a woman and the Canadian school district and the Canadian state broadcaster and just in true go that vile little They all were like yeah, this is fine. This is somebody we don't need FCC restrictions We start talking about Trudeau and she is living her truth With giant beach balls as breasts and a wig and like a you know a five dollar wig you get at a store That's a woman now. Oh, you don't think that's a woman Why why can't you get past that? Why are you so bigoted those those aren't beach balls? Those are her natural breasts the whole thing was appalling appalling So this is why I know no more no more.

Well, first of all Uh, yes I do think that anyone who is still testing for covet has lost their minds If you are sitting around at home doing home covet test I think that your brain is broken and I think you need to get back to normalcy And what I said as a part of this discussion something I'd say on this radio show Have you ever gotten a flu test in your life buck? Uh, they made me once when I had the flu Okay, I have never to my knowledge ever gotten a flu test like everybody listening to us out there I have had the flu. I've gotten sick. It's an awful feeling gotten underneath the covers Thrown up all the time like the flu was I just say though The the finding out about flu or not made note. I was staying home for the week period Correct because I was sick as hell It's time to get back to normalizing You're going to get sick if you're sick stay home from work Stay home from your normal activities If you feel as if you are well enough to work You should work It's been three years And the reason why I was talking about this was savanna gothary at today's show we talked about it on this program block Tested positive felt fine went into the day show. They're still testing for covet and they center home and said you can't work today There should be no testing for covet anywhere at any business in my opinion still And there also should be no home testing Unless I don't even know what the benefit of it would be if you feel sick Stay home if you get so sick that you need super treatment go to the hospital Which is the rule that we basically had for every illness for my entire life Can we get back to that? I don't even understand how what I said is remotely controversial Didn't you have uh by the way, it's we didn't get an email because I want to be clear We we got an email from a vip clan buck dot com Please become a vip Who said that she has a nose ring and blue hair and loves our show and listens every day? Yes, which is fantastic I just want to say, you know all all are welcome hair size of it. It's not like we're fashion plates here Um, but didn't you retweet a woman? I don't know if she had blue hair, but she had an n95 mask on yes, and she she was She looked like a crazy person. Yes Yes, everybody out there who in my opinion is still wearing a mask Is crazy. I think their brains are broken They refuse to acknowledge that the mask has no impact And these people walking around outside still wearing masks I feel so bad for them But I don't know how they return to normal american life I think their brains are so broken so overrun.
