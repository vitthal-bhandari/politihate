    "text": " FUCK THE GATE! \ud83c\udfb5 Alright, let's do this! How are you? What the fuckers? What the fuck buddies? What the fucksters? What the fuck abilities? What the fucking ears? What the fucking knots? Hi, it's Mark Marin. How are you? Are you okay? Everything good? Are you running? Are you driving? Are you on the train? Are you at home cooking or cleaning? I hope it's going okay. I don't know how you're listening to this or where you're listening to it. I just talked to somebody who I met at a party the other night the 4th of July and she said that some of these episodes were so moving that she would be moved to tears. And she had to stop listening to the podcast at work because she didn't think that when she told her co-workers she was listening to music that they were buying it and she had to keep her shit together at her job and I took that as very high compliment. Some of these things are emotionally compelling but I'm sad that I can't help her distract herself from her job anymore, but it was for good reason. Can I plug for a second? Because I got these shows coming up in Boulder, Colorado Friday July 24th at the Boulder Theater and at the Paramount Theater in Denver, Colorado on Saturday July 25th and I like some people to go and we were doing okay, but be nice if more people came. I don't always know if people know I'm coming. It doesn't seem that there's anything I can do to get the word out as efficiently as I might want to. So I'm telling you now Boulder Friday July 24th and Denver Saturday July 25th. That's that. That's how that goes. Laura Jane Grace is on the show today. She is the singer for the band Against Me, punk rock band that's been around for a lot of years. I knew nothing about them. I knew nothing about her when I got the the record in the mail. I don't even know who who sent me the record but I put it on as I do many of the records I get most of the records I get and I listened to it. I'm like damn this singer means business. This band means business. There's a lot of a lot going on here. There's something underneath all this and the album was called transgender dysphoria blues. Still had no idea knew nothing about him and it turns out Laura Jane Grace is transgender and and it's relatively new that she is Laura Jane Grace and I became sort of fascinated with that because whatever that struggle was in my mind when I just did a little bit of research really informed this record that this record was about you know real change real conflict struggle and and identity and I was nervous I don't know if I was nervous, but I'm awkward in I have not it's I'm sort of an old guy when it comes to this the politics around it and the social momentum and I didn't know if I was gonna talk right. I mean, I'm not saying it's new. I just it's not in my everyday life necessarily. It seems like the younger people who kind of came up with it and grew up with it like the woman I'm dating Sarah who spent a lot of time in San Francisco and she's in her mid 30s and it was just it just is what it is, but I seem to have missed that or perhaps I was just in stand-up comedy clubs my entire young adulthood and not out in the world, but I was I was nervous in a way because I've I've made I've said look You can say whatever you want. This is a weird thing about about words names you know things that are that we evolve out of culturally be there in this this sort of reflects back To my conversation with the president into you know some of the the type of feedback that comes around words is that You know censorship is is is really cultural It's it's no there's no law saying you can't say anything you can say anything you want free speech does exist You can say whatever you want Just know that that if you say something that Is hurtful or insensitive or objectifying? Hateful You're going to feel that You're gonna have to answer to it perhaps But it just it's not taken lightly and then I understand like you know There is an argument that like you know people shouldn't be so sensitive or or what's it what's happening? People should be able to take the hit or whatnot But the truth of the matter is no one's telling you you can't say anything You just might end up only hanging out with people that say that Because they're the only people you can say it to and then you're just gonna have to assess Is that the group of people you want to be hanging out with and in our we in the right place with things? I mean, I'm a comedian so we You can say words that are culturally inappropriate hateful objectifying You can say them to people that that they may be in a broader sense directed at but those people have a sense of humor about it and that is part of your Unique relationship with that person that's fine But you you know if you say them if you defend your right to say them to a large group of people You better you better have a pretty good defense on some level, but I had a thing with the word tranny I Believe I talked to RuPaul about this who then defended the word and got his own flack from it and and You know in my mind there it just seems to me that that words come and go That words there there it's something about a social democracy a cultural democracy that eventually You know public opinion, you know moves past it out of respect for for the usually minority that was being dehumanized by the language You don't say Chinaman anymore You know, you know, you don't say WAPT Tranny you know seem like an innocuous one to even me, but but it as as culture evolves and communities grow and and demand The respect they deserve is people and maybe the swaying bothers them. Maybe it hurts their feelings Maybe it makes them feel less than but no one's saying you can't say anything It's just a way cultural democracy works and social democracy works is eventually it's sort of like well you know what this this this word is is is hurtful and and it's dehumanizing and and It's making a community of people feel shitty about themselves. It's not easy for them to begin with But they can say it That's it that that's that's that's just part of the the way it goes But to demand equal rights on that well, then you're gonna have to sort of really explain Where that's coming from your need to say that whatever that maybe but getting back to The Lord Jane Grace coming over I I just needed to know there was a lot of things I needed to know and there was a lot of things I needed to know about her There's a lot of things I needed to know about you know my engagement and interaction with the transgender people and You know I want to grow I want to be up to speed. I want to be appropriate. It's hard. It's a hard shift to make around You know just changing habits, especially word wise. I mean it Look it was hard. It's hard to let go of certain words You know especially when they got a little punch to him I Mean you know I it took a lot for me to let go of retard any of the flack I got for that was from families of Mentally challenged people It's it's hard for me not to use the word cunt But I never use it for women. I only use it for men and and I'm still not quite past that Sometimes I enjoy you know calling it a guy a cunt on Twitter. Sometimes I enjoy it and it's hard It's hard to let go that Tranny was not a big one that I used a lot So that one wasn't hard to to shift out to rotate out But you know we almost make mistakes. I said gypped the other day and Someone said You know That's that's swaying this derogatory you know against gypsies and I'm and they're my first response They're like really really is there anybody really upset about that gypped. It's like Jew down. Yeah, but this is that really? I mean, okay. Yeah, all right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'll I'll be aware I'll be aware and I will and I and I can take that out of rotation Because once you start doing that and once you start being aware of those words It sort of opens you up to experience things in a new way. It opens up, you know a different type of respect it takes down a wall that sort of defensive or based on lack of Sensitivity and it opens you up a little bit And now and I was very open here. You know I liked Laura Jane Grace's work But but I was nervous because I didn't want to be inappropriate in Terms of how I handled the conversation around what I needed to talk about which is I What what what happened inside of you to make these decisions? I want to know I want to feel what you feel I Think I think I did all right. I think so I've been going through stuff doing some summer cleaning and and folks I do try to listen to it This is the interesting thing about the you know sometimes things get through I get a lot of artwork which I always keep and I'm running out of space to put it up I appreciate all of your creativity and I'm very flattered by it Even though the president saw it as narcissistic a lot of the pictures of me or pictures that you guys do here in the in the garage All the CDs that come from you personally and the vinyl that comes from you personally I try to listen to More so the records because I'm into record CDs. I'll go through but I make snap judgments But I'm just telling you this sometimes things get through I will listen to all the vinyl at least once For a bit and a lot of the CDs and sometimes things get through like against me's transgender dysphoria blues it got through and They are on tour right now. They're against me is on tour You can go to against me dot net for tour dates You can get transgender dysphoria blues and you can pre-order their new live album Which comes out in September and then they've got a very the very prolific band. There's a big cattle up there So now now I'm gonna talk to to Laura Jane Grace I actually put all my stuff in storage right before I left on this most recent jaunt Just because I was like my landlord wanted to raise the rent and I was just like screw it This is ridiculous. Oh my god paying like whatever Yeah, well, that's that's what you got to do to make a living as a musician, you know But I mean like do you have a house? Well, I I own a house with with my ex who I'm going through your divorce with So like I own a house in Florida that I rented out what part of Florida St. Augustine Oh, really? But it'd be beyond like having a house there I'd been in Chicago for since like 2013 or whatever in an apartment in an apartment. Yeah In Chicago since 2013. Yes, August of 2003. That's when he's put up with the wife that is. Yeah All into shit on everything got fucked Life has a tendency to do that to you sometimes you've you've gone through some dramatic shifts In the last few years. That's understated, huh? Yeah, but like here's the thing is what I was telling you is I know we have a lot of common fans and people were excited to to have us talk is that I don't know where I got the new record That trend the transgender dysphoria blues, but it was sent to me by your label or somebody. Well, I'm we're our own label So I don't know how I got it. Yeah, that's cool. You have it. You didn't send it to me. No, uh-oh Unless maybe our management did or publicist. I don't know or something like that Oh, I know is it like I get a lot of records, you know And and oh I get a lot of records sent to me and I listened to him and I put this one on and I'm like Well, this sounds fucking real like I in like an all listener records People sent me and they don't always click, you know for whatever reason I do too Yeah, right and you just put it on you like I'm not gonna listen this again Yeah, but this one I'm like my guy wasn't doing it again And I was like there's some earnest angry interesting shit on here And then and then I kind of did a little research into you and I'm like who the hell's this person? Well, and then then like when I when I I think I actually tweeted that I liked the record and then everybody was like Oh, you gotta have lower on it and then I realized that you have this following and you've been you've been around for a while So then I had to go back as I do and I got to buy the other records So yes, you sold a few records in the last few days But the interesting thing about it is like the the and on outside of look up dysphoria Most people trip up and say dysmorphia or some other variation of that. Well, right? Why I didn't know what exactly it was but it's like a fairly familiar state to any creative person It's a uneasiness and a depressive uneasiness, right? Kind of the opposite of you for you Okay, so but it seems to me that you know despite the the title of this Record and whatever you've gone through recently that like for for someone who was gravitated to punk rock dysphoria was Something you live with all your life. It was yeah for sure I mean it was what pushed me to punk rock just cuz punk rock seemed like such a It was it was like armor, you know, yeah studs and spikes on your leather jacket and a mohawk, right? Yeah, so we're but where'd you grow up South Florida and Naples, Florida? See I know anything about it I know Florida like sometimes I get a little weird about Florida, but my mother was a lot of people too A lot of people's mothers live in Florida, right? But like it but like there's there there's an element down there That in my mind like and they people have gotten mad at me for busting on Florida But some people there's like it's sort of the end of the line down there Yeah, for in a lot of ways mentally and physically for some people for sure And well that was very much the perspective growing up of like you are at the end of the line And the only way to look was north because right unless you wanted to swim You know like you had a good horse especially Naples Yeah, and that was like, you know pre-internet days, so it's like no bands ever toured down there There was no pre-existing punk scene Yeah, that was when you really had to kind of invent your own thing when you were a kid. How do you I'm 34? Uh-huh and in what was your family like? I mean where were they doing down there? Why'd you end up there? I grew up in a military family and my parents divorced when I was like 12 13 years old So I moved with my mother and my younger brother in with my grandmother who had retired to Naples, Florida So that was it. Yeah, and that doesn't sound great. No, I mean it was not a good experience Well, we moved from Naples, Italy to Naples, Florida And I'd lived in Italy then at that point for like four or five years You know really had gotten accustomed to that because it was probably like from grades like Like second grade until like fifth sixth grade, you know, and there's an American bacer There is uh-huh and then what kind what was your what was your dad in the military? Yeah, he was a West Point graduate. So he was a major in the US Army Wow. Is he still around? He retired he did 20 years and then he retired outside of Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri Really and do you guys talk? Mm-hmm. He hasn't talked to me since I came out or we haven't talked since I came out Yeah, since you came out. Did you know is there a process? Is there two processes of coming out? I guess there is when you're somebody who like does interviews and you know has a public persona There's the private in the public sure right but when you say coming out as a transgender person Yeah, uh-huh and that was what that that becomes Relatively obvious so eventually right well That was kind of the point was the go ahead and come out before anything was relatively obvious right because I thought that that would like Especially having you know, I play in a band I have a career and like people in the punk scene are in general kind of homophobic then right sexist So if I would have not come out and just started like wearing eyeliner or expressing femininity I think people would have been like, you know way more Unaccepting that if I had just said look this is what's going on to me. Can you please fuck off? Well, I go through this and just like you know, maybe it'll be weird sometimes. I might not look totally great all the time You know, right, right. This is what it is, right? You know ahead of time so but it's sort of funny though Like in in my mind that that like real punk rock purist if you just started showing up with eyeliner and stuff They might as you know, they might even think that you were moving towards some other type of music Oh totally well like a green day green day is a great example of that I mean that was the first first punk show I ever went to yeah people make fun of Billy Joe sometimes for making a For wearing eye on yeah, yeah, which is totally homophobic. Yeah, I'm totally transphobic and fucked up Yeah, but it's also it's also like I think it also represents another kind of music I mean you seem you know make up more in goth and in rock and roll and I think maybe punk is sort of supposed to be just You know raw right I guess I mean it depends on what kind of perception of punk rock you had and like cuz like if you look back at like Lineage of punk bands yeah, Susie Sue and the Banshee sure they were a punk band You know like they right like I mean even the cure head elements in punk rock starting out You know and like they're used to just be a wider variety of what was able to interpret Mike Ness social fucking distortion Another state of mind is like you know Covered an eyeliner the whole thing because I talked to him who I talked to Mike Watt recently and there's like because there's a punk rock style But the I the original punk rock was really just about doing whatever the fuck you wanted totally And that's what attracted me to it because that seemed like it would be more of a safe space Yeah, yeah, yeah, and a lot of the like especially like late 70s English piece punk bands that were really in the anarchist politics and stuff like that I was really drawn to that just because that was even way more liberal and like way more about like you know gender liberation and smashing You know, but they haven't been to like a earlier I mean you come into that they were already nostalgia acts by then right by the time you were coming to it Like they've been around a while yeah Although it's funny to think about that stuff because I think about that in like relative to my own career Yeah, like okay You know almost been a band for 20 years and how like has it been 20 almost yeah And like that that it doesn't seem like as wide of a gap even though it is as long to compared to when I was listening to those bands from the late 70s early 80s like only 10 years difference. I guess that's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah So okay, so you're dad and mom split your 13. He's in the military. He hasn't talked to you now What in like three or four years? Yeah, but you were talking before that yeah I mean, you know, it's tough like when we when my parents split up Yeah, like there was a definite separation and you know that like it was a dividing thing in my family Yeah, kind of in ways a relationship never really recovered. You know were you close when you were a kid Yeah, I mean, you know the military is really a thing, you know, and if you're someone who's You know went through went to West Point and has been in the army for a long time like, you know generally being really Emotionally expressive or close, you know in like open like that is not a thing, right? You know like it's just kind of a cold especially when it's a German background to you know really He comes from a German background. Mm-hmm. What about your mom? What kind of background well no, I mean like how was your relationship with her? Would she the buffer? Yeah, and I mean I was really close with my mom. I was first kid or whatever. How many younger brother, but there's two he is? Where's he at? He's in South Florida. Really? Uh-huh. He's like see if I wanted to start smoking when I was 13 years old I would have probably been his height. He's like six seven. He uh, you're pretty tall. Yeah, six two But again, I would have been another five inches if I was smoking But he like he cracked safes for a living and he owns his own business installing like high-end security system for people and security systems in South Florida. So you guys get along? Yeah, we do. All right So there you are you like what it so you get there when you're like 12 or 13 to Naples And and what's it? What's it like down there? I can't picture it is just a wasteland or what is it pretty? Well, it you know Starting then was a real period of economic growth where like you know during that period of time I think there are more millionaires per capita in call your county Florida than anywhere else in the u.s. And the two cities in call your county are Naples and amokly Amokly being a migrant farm worker community with like extreme levels of poverty, right? You know, um, so there was a real contrast and in general like it was a retirement community So it's an older republican white retirement community That doesn't want youth to be that to be seen or heard right? Yeah, so there wasn't there just wasn't a lot to do besides like get in trouble, you know Right and what was it? What was the kind of trouble you were getting into? Um, you know, it like small shit like vandalism like you go to a golf course and you kick all the sprinkler heads off and stuff like that And you know, we used to rip head Hood ornaments off a car. Yeah or stealing chromies off of tires and stuff like that You know, we're like taking a battery and throwing it car windows. It's oh shit. Tell it guns. We have pelican Yeah, pay ball guns all that stuff, you know, and what was the what was the the music that How did you form your little crew? I mean because yeah, I don't know what you're what you're we talking about So that was 1993 or so something like that So were you the uh the oddballs the that you and your friends where the you were the punk rock kids? Totally and we went like I mean my group of friends that I kind of went into high school with like We met in middle school and like at first it was like, you know, listening to classic rock bands Led Zeppelin the doors pink floor. It's always there And then like but that like there was a real disconnect with the like kind of hippie movement that we associated with that Because we got beat up a lot and it seemed like that that was like by jocks You know, like we were the freaks, you know, like and you sit together at lunch, but not the hippie freaks Well, it was all just like you were the freaks. They like right it's small population So it's like the skaters the hippies the off kids everybody side together But punk rock appealed because it was seemed a little bit more about fighting back And like even if you're gonna get your ass kicked throwing up a couple punches in yeah So that like and did you yeah totally totally? I mean, you know to varying results But it's it felt better to fight back, you know, yeah And and what bands were you listening to? At the first first record is never mind the bullock sex pistols and then that led into the clash and like there's all those Classic punk bands that you first listened to like the dead Kennedys and the Misfits And then we kind of like gravitated towards what was more going on in the US of like bands out on the west coast Like bad religion and rants it and no offense. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and then like just like you know You you back then you'd read the line on us and see who they thanked and then you'd go buy those records Right and if you liked them you'd see who they think and they were records right yeah, right? We're in they still records then. Mm-hmm. They weren't CDs yet. I did CDs and vinyl, but I've always preferred vinyl So when did you start playing guitar? Uh when I was eight years old. Oh, really? So who taught you that? I mean who gave you the guitar? I I just I saved up money mowing lawns And I like got five bucks a pop and where I had where were you when you were mowing lawns not in Italy Yeah in Italy really I ordered it out of a series the american lawn mowing kid. Yeah You ordered out of a Sears Cadillac. What were you time traveling? I did it was a hundred and twenty five dollar guys Sears guitar. It was a harmony guitar. Oh harmony. Yeah. Yeah It's out of Sears. That's a Sears brand. It was out of the Sears catalog. Oh shit. It was an electric. No, it was an acoustic You what that's like time traveling to me like a Sears catalog and even though they still that was your idea If I guess you're eight, what do you like? Where did you get it? We you know when you when you're an american family that moves overseas you're really cut off and especially like then you're still really dependent on people Back home and ordering things from back home. Oh, so someone got it for you No, like I say that we you get the catalog I saved my money and then I sent away for it Yeah, uh-huh and I had to wait like a month Like and then they sent the guitar and how do you learn? I took lessons from an army wife at first. Oh, really? Uh-huh and she just taught on bass and yeah, no no, she taught at her home like we lived off bass over and over and so And you went over there and you earned your basics. Yeah, just like once a week g acde then barre chords I you know it's it's messed up though because like learning on a and an acoustic like that Especially when you're a kid when you don't have strong fingers like those guitars are basically Like made for archery like the action right the steel string Yeah, totally and the strings are like an inch off the fretboard. It's hard to press down So that was really discouraging at first. What was your what were your first songs? I wasn't really interested at first like there because it was all like, you know, whatever the guitar I know but the book they gave you it was just like, you know, it was like Michael wrote his brother She like I didn't want to play that so like I stuck with it, but I never felt like I was like oh I'm bad I can't really play this because I was totally interested But I stuck with it and then like finally when I was like maybe 11 years old I started like playing in bands like just with my church group We started up bands and what what kind of church were you in? It was a Presbyterian church that my mother brought us to I have no idea It was just more like when she didn't force she wanted to be social and there was like child care sure Yeah, it wasn't you didn't you didn't grow up with the weight of god on you not not heavy. No, that's good Yeah, so now when do you start to feel different? I felt different my whole life. Those are like earliest memories, you know, uh-huh Like earliest memories like what do we talk if I if I can like think of my three earliest memories Which are like kind of just you know those weird Disconnected visual impression impressions I remember maybe being three years old and like standing on the top of a staircase as the first one And then I remember probably four or five years old Fort Hood, Texas standing in the living room in front of the tv and Madonna was on the tv And feeling a sense of identity in watching Madonna perform Right and it was like a weird moment of both like oh, that's amazing. You know, she's performing She's dancing. She's singing, you know, like this is crazy music I've never heard before and I I like the melody sure but then also a feeling of like I could do that too And immediately recognizing but like wait, I'm not That's not how people perceive me. There's a disconnect. How old are you? Four or five, huh? And then when then what how else did that then after that? I distinctly remember like within a year or two after watching rosemary's baby And like feeling audibly drawn to me a pharaoh because she had like the pixie haircut I was like, oh, well wait, maybe there's a chance for me because I have hair like that That's how my parents get my hair cut. So maybe maybe I'm not wrong Maybe I could grow up to be like that. Yeah, you could grow up to be a woman Grow up to be me a pharaoh All right, I love the ambitions with daughter and me a pharaoh. I thought a little short But it's not over. Yeah Like all right, so you're playing guitar you're 11 and you're starting to get the hang you starting to decide what music you like 11 or 12 Yeah, well, no, I mean I I got a walkman when I was eight years old around when I first got a guitar and I started by metal tapes Like I got def leopard hysteria was the first that I was your music Yeah, and that was like I was drawn to them because I saw in them ambiguity in the in their sex But you also like the music I did although some of it really, you know, yeah But I liked looking at them. I mean you could find plenty of Ambiguity and rock music sure sure. Yeah, but you felt that right But at the same time too because I lived overseas I was totally cut off from MTV like I really was stumbling into stuff on my own So like I found hip parader magazine. I looked at the pictures and I was like I can't tell if these are boys or girls You know like and then sure I'd go and buy the tapes and and some stuff I'd like and some stuff I wouldn't but you found that well a lot of what compelled you was the The androgyny of the people yeah, but then like the bands I was really drawn to was like that Had more than iolistic attitude like guns and roses in particular was like my band when I was a kid They're a good band. They had a Appetite is great and I stand behind illusions too should have been Illusion should have been one record but other than that right lies was good I mean I I got no problem with I don't know what happened with chinese democracy, but I bought it so I can criticize it I know I bought it. Yeah, it wasn't I didn't like it No, I don't know that I listened to it twice I listened to it I bought a bunch of times but I illusions I listened to twice So what was it so you reinventing axel rose was your first record right now? All right, but I don't want to miss a time chunk here So you lock into guns and roses at like 11 or what eight years old. Uh-huh. That's one appetite when it first came out 88 or it came at 87. I was eight years old and he's great fucking singer. Uh-huh compelling Totally all of them are deaf and slash You know like I wore a sid chain because duff or one before I knew who Sid Vicious was right So you were pretty primed by the time you got to the pistols with rock. I was I knew a little bit. Yeah a little bit You know everything if you listen to guns and roses and you lock in at eight There But but when do you start realizing that this is your future and when do you start? Feeling like I'm making an assumption in that as your creativity evolved And and became what it was in these first few records that your frustration with your self must have Been happening alongside of that right. Um, well, I mean I made the decision Was what I was gonna do really young music? Yeah, like I dropped out of high school when I was 16. I never had any doubts I just knew this was gonna do one way or the other even if I was unsuccessful at it This is what I was gonna be never you never started playing metal though. You never started playing No, no like the first bands I ever had like that by that time I was more grunge bands like we'd cover Nirvana songs and Pearl Jam songs Oh, yeah And then like at the same time doing like Pink Floyd songs or Beatles songs And then that was like and then we got into punk ron That's how you learn how to play I guess basically with other people is play the play the play the heads Play the classic stupid how I can still remember to play songs from then like I know how to play even flow But I don't remember how to play some of the songs I wrote like five years ago. Really? It was sticks with you, right? It does. Yeah. Mm-hmm. That's why it's a hit song. Yeah So because like I mean like when I listen to like some of the older stuff Like it's sort of fascinating to me that there you know that the the the punk rock form Like it feels a little familiar like you like in in the sense that like the clash or like I can tell where you're coming from But you're you're singing is so you know kind of raw and brutal and and full of uh A type of intensity and anger that that is you know rare And you know, it sounds like anybody else But like in looking at the arc of your life I have to assume that the anger that you were feeling Became much more defined with this new record for sure I mean also, I mean it was like it was there I mean you mentioned that a second go like really what like made the anger levels like grow and dysphoria grow as like my band progress was As we experienced success And as you're further cast into because when we started out we started out with really like specific ideals of being against all that You know and against me it comes from what? Uh feel being 17 years old and feeling like everything in the world's conspiring against you And then you're pushing back with this music Sure that was my outlet And you know, we were really starting out of the way the band started as far as on an acoustic guitar It was because like I didn't have an electric guitar So I played an acoustic guitar the drummer didn't have a drum set So we dumpster to have pickle buckets made a drum set and that's what we did And we didn't have places to play because it was south florida So we busked on the street and then eventually like you met at least you were set up for that Yeah, well that was the idea, you know, like and that was what it was modeled Well, that's how well that's I think that's that's how billy bragg sort of started I think in the violent femme's kind and there was totally and I was heavily heavily influenced by both of them and oh really? Yeah, that was part of the beginning. Yeah, yeah So so you're busking and you're doing this you're doing your original songs Yeah, and they're sort of so those were two a couple of your influences But there's some clash in there sure the clash and again like all the piece punk bands crass the mob Yeah, it's a pinky and that comes away later. You can't really do that with an acoustic and buckets Right. Well when I was 14 years old I got arrested and it was like life-changing experience for me Because I was like 14 years old beat up by the cops charged with a resisting arrest and a battery on an officer Tried as an adult convicted as a felon by the time I was 15 years old for what I went to the beach 4th of july There was I like ran into the wrong cops I was a dirty smelly punk kid and I got lippy with them when they got up in my face And then they beat me up and were you playing an abandoned that point or no? Yes, I was playing in a band not against me, but I was playing in a punk band at that point I had like this is like a right to passage. Yeah, I guess I mean I didn't see it coming But yeah, so I mean so what happened? Why was it a life-changing experience? I mean because I was fucked I was 15 years old and I was a twice convicted felon like I had really already sealed my deal as far as what my options were for the future Like I was tried as an adult. I was eating do jail time. Did you no? I got like 180 hours of community service and I was on house arrest for a whole summer, you know I was like lowjacked. So where the fuck did you do that much community service? I worked in a hospital and I volunteered in the cardio wing like giving people like Jell-o cups and water after they'd been walking on a truck and I then I did a habitat for humanity And then I did like you could choose what you could do Well, I just had a lot of hours so I had to do a bunch of stuff and then there was just place the conservancy that was like a nature conservancy So well that must have been some of those sound pretty good like they could have been good experiences I got great things out of them But it was like when you're 15 years old and you're in that situation you're scared shit So my mom didn't have any money and like they're threatening you like you're gonna go to jail or you're gonna go to juvie You know and I didn't want to do that You know I wanted to hang out with my friends and play music Right and so like I immediately had that weight on me You know and and it was at that point because up until then like I had already gotten into drugs and alcohol and stuff like that That was your shit Um, I really liked tripping on acid and I really liked to coke and I really liked smoking weed And at that point when I got arrested, I just like sobered up and I was like 16 years old Trying to get focused get on track and and that was when I started playing music And that's when I or like more seriously and stumbled into against me So you stop doing the the drugs And just full-on focus. So that's where all that insane That you know vocal energy comes from you. This is the clarity of Pure anger. I was beer. Yeah, yeah But then like it sort of it seems to me like you know in um, you know, maybe being presumptuous or or maybe not fully You know recognizing the the arc of it It just seems like you know, the first couple records are full-on and then at some point around the third record You you did become a little self-aware and that you were shifting your your your perception of what you were really doing creatively Sure. Yeah, and a lot of that just had to come I came with success because like we came from the scene That was really about this certain thing diy punk ethics who is in and you guys you honored that by Like there was no punk scene like you did what a lot of the bands a lot of the guys I started it ourselves Yeah, put out our own first break. This is two decades. I mean this is a decade later from the original wave of those guys right or at least This is like well Like you you did have the internet Yeah, yeah, totally and but it was coming as it was all happening and file sharing was happening and that was all changing But it was you know like I was dealing with a much different perspective than people must have assumed I was dealing with And part of that for me was always being recognizing like that I was dealing with dysphoria You know or like that I had that and so it like always skewed my perspective That's retrospect. This is retrospect that you're saying that with like I mean sure sure no, but it's attached me You know like I saw things like okay like this is my circumstance, right? This is what I'm facing. I'm playing in this band These people are now calling me a sellout because we moved to a slightly bigger indie label They're giving us all this money all the so we got a lawyer. We got a manager. We got a booking agent Your original fans are fucking doing you yeah, and they're like slashing our tires being really abusive attacking at you hold on so when you start out when you put yourself did your first record right first like two Like a seven inch and a 12 inch we put out just like you know That's like that's righteous to that crew the diy punk rock crew and they they can buy them at your shows and they can buy your t-shirts and You're playing bucks for a 12 and you're playing on bills Did you spend any time opening for acts that you respected that just builds our own tours and went out and did our own tours? So there was never any of the house shows playing playing in basements playing on the streets still like playing Sometimes you get a club gig, but it was all booking it yourself for the first like four five years But there was never the the sort of like you know the you know a bigger punk band came into town They needed a punk opener and well in Gainesville where we moved to no idea records exist And no idea does a really good job of documenting the punk scene there And they've had a couple bands like hot water music and less than Jake that have gone on to do things You know they took a notice of us We put out a record with them and that was like the first step to a really small indie and already then people decried like sellouts But then well then we moved to like fat records, which is like slightly bigger Bigger, you know indy a man that you know run by fat mic who we had grown up listening in right effects And then that was like even more intense wave of like your sellouts, you know like total Which is no effect was sellout at that point because it was a bigger indie and then we started working with like People their punks No, I get it but like at a certain point do you realize like we might have to lose that they'll come back around? Well, no, I mean it was more just realized the hypocrisy of it But once I saw that hypocrisy of it then I like was like oh fuck this that you know like do the punk thing think for yourself These are my circumstances. This is what I have to do These are the decisions that are right for me There's nothing wrong with doing the things I want to do Right and so I wanted to be in a band and play for larger audiences And as you do that more and more because we were touring like you know Fucking nine months out of the year playing like 200 some odd shows a year like driving ourselves into the ground and most of the time We were homeless, you know like so eventually you're like oh, it'd be nice to have an apartment You don't be grown up My own Chevy great, you know but like you know when I So like that so around the third record that's the new label Well, that's when like yeah and we started getting major label attention and we got corded one whole round And like turned it down got a bigger deal from like our ND And then went and like finally ended up signing with Warner Sire So what was that record that we did across or which record was the first record on the new label The first record on the major label was new wave Okay, so because like like I listened to a few of the songs and it seems that like as you're saying You know that these punks sort of abandoned you or they swashed your tires or they were mad that you were sellouts That you also realized the limitations of that of that outlook sure totally totally like you were maturing along With your success right in a way. It wasn't killing you. No, it was healthy. That was like the one good thing I had going for me, you know so now so this um The dysphoria because like you know I imagine I had dysphoria for one reason or another So like your malcontent Uh, you know at that juncture where you know you blow out you blow yourself out on all the punk rock shit And obviously you get a little older a little more successful and he's still feeling a little shitty Then then it starts to become about something else not just about you know class warfare or or well then the dysphoria comes back Yeah, because that was the thing is like, you know you jump into this where you're like oh shit our band's getting like traction We're gonna go off and we're gonna tour for three four years or something And then you're still unhappy and at first you were able to push the dysphoria aside because you're able to solely focus on that You know like I'm going to be this person. I'm going to do this How are you operating within the band? I mean how where was your sexuality at? um, I mean It was there, you know Well, I got I got married when I was 19 years old and I was married from when I was 19 And we probably became estranged from each other when I was like 21 Yeah, so then like 22 to 23. I was going through the hole like oh shit My marriage just fell apart like really throwing my first marriage or the one that just ended my first marriage So you've been married twice. Yes. Okay, and so then 19 Yeah, and so 22 and 23 24 were like the last years of coming out of a marriage and being really fucked up or sleeping out Sleeping around a lot. Yeah, you read a band that's touring a bunch and just doing stupid shit. Right. So Where'd you meet that woman? At a bar or well, no, I don't where did I meet her? No, I I met her at an activist in foreshop at the civic media center I think an active an activist info shop. Oh a non-corporate press Library lending library an activist space in Gainesville, Florida called the civic media centers where we met what was that place? What did they have there? I volunteered there. It was like an activist organizing center Like everything from like a women's group to like, you know radical bike workshops to act like a full service activist training center Exactly What what are you fighting against? Basic capitalism capitalism. That was the old that's a big one. That's a big one We're gonna have to get a few books out a few booklets on capitalism Noam Chomsky's luckily written about it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good luck with that getting through the noam Chomsky's Did you read all his I did I read all that I'm a goldman all the peter krapatkin all that stuff So you were you just got a handful of it. Oh, yeah, I mean I used to volunteer there and I booked shows there They'd let me book punk shows and that was where against me just like play it all the time because that was the only place So your singular political agenda was against capitalism in your mind I mean at the time it was really against like, you know The world trade organization at the time of like the 1999 like riots in Seattle All that protest movement was really happening and that was like all my friends were a part of that I had like connected with an activist group in Florida doing food not bombs Yeah, and we organized into something called fran Which was the florida radical activist network And we'd meet up like once a month all talk about what we had going on in our area And then organize like rides to bigger protests or demonstrations against like so you've been an activist all your life Really in one form or another. Yeah So that's pretty earnest man That's some earnest punk shit Because like I'm sort of fascinated with the whole the whole sort of like Now like as I said at the beginning this record, you know when I when I read the lyrics and I listened to it The activism, you know, it is not it's not it's very personal That because of of your transformation That you know, you've resolved some things in yourself And you realize there's still a lack of understanding and there's still a lot of reasons to be angry about, you know How you're interpreted sure very personal so you're bringing that same intensity that you saw global injustice You know to this, you know very sort of your cards connected to this in a way that is uh Non-negotiable. I'd like to think that it's a little smarter even than like the politics I was singing about what I thought I was younger I I mean of course if you're familiar with like embrace Ian MacKyseband your emotions are nothing but politics And this is something that's really real to me The things I was singing about when I was younger while I felt the way I felt and still agree with it I didn't have as big of an understanding or a worldview at 19 years old as I do now at 34 having like been around the world A number of times, you know, well, yeah, I mean I used to do political talk radio lefty talk radio And at some point I realized that like I don't know if I'm angry about these specific things. I know that I'm angry So let's address the existential and personal Foundation or the core of that anger exactly and do it so So you were married once and that fizzled out and then you went through heartbreak when do you start? Wrestling with the desire to to uh become a woman Well, like 2005 or so, you know, I'd gotten really fucked up on cocaine and then 2005 I was like, I'm gonna be sober I got sober so you went back to drugs. Yeah, yeah Clean myself up and like at the same time after having gone through about of like the way it worked back then was like these Experience of extreme dysphoria and then like binging and purging and being like, no, you know, like I'm going to be a man This is what I'm going to do. I'm going to pretend I do not feel this way And that coincided with like signing a major record label deal and then you're swept off on that rollercoaster But then come down from that, you know, when like you do two records and they're not a success or anything like that We went through this fucking lawsuit with the next manager things like, you know, like friends die Shit happens in life and you realize like I still feel this way, you know, I'm fucked up You're uncomfortable and and I like I'm living this two separate lives. I'm married. I now have a kid We bought a house, you know, like and I don't know who I am, you know, right? So When you did that and when you got married that second time, you know, was it, you know a We reacting to your feelings. Did you think that by doing that, you know, you could sort of train yourself Into that life. I think about it often just because I wonder if it's like subconscious, you know, because I would hate to think that But I was really like, you know, I got focused. I got sober. I got healthy I was like, you know, I wasn't fucked up making bad decisions And then I fell in love and I will I didn't want to fall in love But I fell in love and it was more that like I fell in love And I'm ignored really being totally honest probably about who I was as falling in love, you know And just like suppressed suppressed, but that made me more and more unhappy as especially as like You're kind of pushed into fitting this like cis normative lifestyle of like, you know, husband, wife, kid, cars in the garage Where's how powerful that is? Yeah, and then you're like, oh my fucking god Like the walls would just like felt like they were coming in more and more When you said you questioned the or you were you know in retrospect, you know, trying to understand what falling in love meant Now what now is your sexual orientation always been towards women? Yeah, and still So That must be I mean, that's not to say I haven't made out with a couple guys or anything like that No, no, no, I know but I'm just like in in terms of and I'm not it's not a judgment thing It's just like I'm just wondering where the fight was like when you say you fell in love with her And you you sort of questioned whether or not that was a sort of like You know, whether it was earnest or not or whether you just subconsciously trying to fit into something It was just I just wondered what the the whole dynamics of that would be but you just Well because you're just being you're existing and at the time too, especially like I mean you have to realize that I probably didn't hear the word Transgender until I was like maybe even 26 or 27 For everybody right right so like I didn't understand myself. It's not like I was carrying around I still don't fucking understand myself But it's not like I was carrying around full knowledge of like this is who I am and I have to hide this from everybody It was like oh my god I have all these feelings that are tearing me apart inside and I don't know how to reconcile them with With life and and what I'm doing and who I am, you know and like I don't know what I'm supposed to do with this The idea of transitioning even like was a far off concept that I'd only ever like, you know, maybe heard about once or twice I think we're all you know like from my where I'm sitting, you know, I I am not Like I'm 51 years old. So so I missed the the movement in a way Of of the trans movement. I mean I knew it existed But now it's like really, you know in the forefront of You know gender politics and also the gender discussion totally in this country and I'm still like an old man When it like you know, I had to be schooled on the word tranny Yeah, and uh, and you know and and then I yeah I talked to rupaul who loves that word But but like I understand some very like divisive word. No, I know and then I get why And I mean like and I'm in no position necessarily to use that well. I don't need to use that word, you know, but rupaul can right you know but um All right. So so now you're married and now these feelings are becoming oppressive and and and Completely uncomfortable. So do you tell your wife? I did I came out. Yeah, uh-huh Well, what does that mean that you knew when you come out like that? What do you say? Well, like I went, you know, like I dealt with these feelings to the point where I was like this isn't going away You know, so I was like what what did I need to be a woman? I need yeah, like I'm just like, you know transitioning Right idea of whatever that meant of like coming out with the way I felt and saying like look I'm transgender or I'm a transsexual. This is the way I feel I want to transition I don't know what that means, but I want to transition like I mean the the level of Information out there was like pretty like it's like youtube testimonial videos, you know Like a couple fucking lo-fi websites that like point you in directions, you know And I was like living in LA at the time like staying up like watching these testimonial videos, right? And it's like okay. Yeah, I think you can get on hormones, you know, like okay There's doctors that can do surgeries like I don't fucking know where to turn to so you know But you were like you were sort of like I got to start this yeah, I mean what do your wife say? I you know, she said okay like that's okay, you know like I like I just came out to her and said like I'm I'm a transsexual. I'm I want to transition and I don't she didn't know what that had you been a practicing transsexual What does that mean practicing my transsexualism? Why mean did you like uh like um I guess I mean like did you dress, you know, did you find a dress in femme? Sure, yeah and totally and like that but like I have a lifestyle that like I spent a lot of time alone And sometimes I'm like really by myself like when I'm working with a band producing a record and I'm living in a hotel room or I'm sure I'm on tour. I have a really separate life from that so it was like I was living two lives Yeah, I was fucking living half a life in a hotel room and when I was in a hotel room I was you know Expressing the way I felt I was her or whatever we put on makeup and like dressing in like wearing the clothes Just addressing wearing the clothes. Yeah wearing women's clothes. Yeah Yeah, but it was it's a shot No, but it's a terrible experience like that because you know you're you're in this like stupid fucking high stress situation where you're like Okay, you know, I got to go into some shitty department store to buy clothes that I don't even want to wear really because it's not my style but this is the only way I can fucking like relax and and Really express this this this fucking like way I feel to calm this like tension that I feel inside of me because otherwise I'm gonna fucking like snap on someone and just we lose it. You know, that's that's profound So and then I guess what you're saying is that because you were living these separate this separate life And it was like really limited to these hotel rooms when you were working that it's hard not to associate that With the idea of shame. Well, yeah, I mean you feel like you're almost having an affair and you are hiding something You know and it's like why can't I just fucking be who I am whenever I want to be who I am So you're in this hotel right so you're in this hotel room losing your mind and you're like I just need to like what pieces of clothing would be the most comforting What pieces of clothing like boy? You go to a department store and would you buy a dress? Do you buy a robe? Do you buy some Panies? What do you do? Panies is a gross word. I don't know. Is it a gross word? You just like whatever fucking even like a fucking woman's cut shirt a woman's cut 10 times Like anything to express femininity. Yeah, you know, you'd feel better like you'd be like Yeah, I feel like okay. I'm like expressing the way I feel even though it's like a weird fucked up version of it Right. It's not like it's that that was even more dysphoric than just being as I am now But you know that changes the experience being out with it now. It's a totally different thing It's not like I get off by going through a fucking department store now and buying Panies and sewing to a hotel room and then fucking going to a hotel and rubbing them or something No, no, and then I didn't think that to begin with but it was really the idea Of because I think everyone Or most people deal with That a discomfort that that seems like it can't be resolved right? And that you know, you were able to address it so specifically and and and have to reckon with That and not feel ashamed of it or or feel like a freak for it other than the you know, the idea that you were hiding something You know, it's a it's a big it's a big step Right obviously and to realize you had to take it and then to take it is You know, it's it's big because I think that you know a lot of people that have the same feelings just die with them Right. That's the case I mean, well, if you look at suicide suicide statistics among the transgender community, you know, it's like something like 50 percent at least Attempt You know, that's it's horrible. Mm-hmm. You didn't know but I've been slowly trying to kill myself for the past 34 years Of alcohol and drugs as a result of that. Yeah, I mean, I feel like that that was the unhealthy side of it You don't do any drugs or alcohol anymore. I do but um, I mean that's like now. It's just fun now No, no seriously It is now. It's just recreational and not fucking dysphoria and like related, you know, yeah, I guess Okay You say so You're you could I guess it, you know, you'll deal with that other shit later. Let's let's do a part two to this podcast Yeah, yeah, I've talked to you in a few years See how your your your your happy go lucky drug use But like but I'm just talking about smoking a little weed You know, that's not a wrong data dumb man But they like that like the lyrics in this fucking record, you know deals with all that you deal with the suicidal, you know With the suicide of people that that can't live with it or whatever Right and you deal with your own sort of wrestling with it You deal with the and I always assume that people write these from first person Mm-hmm, but like you know the the idea of being totally closeted and being a bully is in here is in this record and then the like the discomfort This the first song like is is really the the the transgender the the title song dysphoria blues is like that to me It was it's a powerful fucking song man. Well, that's talking about like that experience You know going into those department stores or going into like, you know Whatever store when you're perceived as male and you're buying something and the red cash register is looking at you like You're disgusting, you know, like they don't even want to take the money out of your hand But what about when you even what about now that like the I thought like some of that song had to do it I mean, that's not it's not like that's gone Right like the idea that you have to you know You have to honor yourself and you have to honor your feelings and be who you need to be But you cannot escape the judgment of being physically who you are of other people Right, but by owning it like I've been able to like feel a lot more comfortable and confident You know in a fucking way in the in a punk rock way of like okay When you're hiding it you feel shameful and that in turn makes you feel defensive And closed off as opposed to being open about it and just being out there and being like look I am who I am You know like you may not fully understand that and I don't really care But I am who I am and I have a right to be here I have a right to shop in the store. I have a right to do this do that do whatever Whatever I want to do and I don't have to explain it to you or justify it to you Right. I'm just gonna do it right and if you have a problem Yeah, I get it. Fuck you. Yeah Yeah, it's your problem. It's your problem. Hope you can deal with that problem Yeah You know whereas before you felt scared and I didn't want to feel scared, you know Well, it yeah, it's it's easy to feel scared if you you know You're going like you want to be understood on your own terms and not misunderstood because you're caught doing something Right. Do you know being like you know because then you're all of a sudden you got a year in that weird explaining yourself position Right. And that was something I thought about too having a kid where I was like what am I gonna be like 50 60 years old and I'm gonna get caught and like yeah, you know like being that like that I don't want that situation You know how old's a kid my daughter is now five and How how is that all with the accent stuff? Um, we're not in a good spot Not really, you know, but what did did but did the the separation have to do with you actually You know engaging in the transition process I mean was it something she couldn't handle and then then no, I mean, I think it's all on me You know like I had a suicidal nervous breakdown about a year after coming out and I just like dissolved as a person You know I would like really you but you didn't attempt suicide. I did. Yeah, uh-huh Wow how yeah pills And alcohol yeah classic Well, you know go with the class. Yes But but this is a year in a year after you came out And what what broke apart inside you um it was a combination of things uh, you know, there was the The mental side where like I legitimately lost The foundation of why I was trans transitioning because I saw that my marriage had like gotten so far away from me Because I had been like I was scared, you know, it was working on a record doing transitioning publicly I had a studio so I was just like locking myself in my studio 10 hours a day working on a record Which I legitimately needed to do with this record. Yeah, but also I was hiding, you know, like yeah And then and then realizing like my marriage had fallen apart and just like that crushed me But then at the same time too I started having like this weird reaction to the hormone replacement therapy I was on and so I it turned out once I moved to Chicago and I got medical help that I had been living with a parasitic infection in my intestines And so at the time I had been on estrogen progesterone and spironolactone and so apparently the progesterone had been converting into Pregnisone which was causing these like crazy hot flashes And I was like waking up in the middle of the night and like my arms would be clenched to my chest And I couldn't take them down And I would be like burning a sweat take a shower come out and be it'd be like 60 degrees in the hotel room And I was just messed up and living in florida going through transition, you know, like It's just totally different than other places where there was like one doctor I could see one therapist I could see dealing with gender and so I called then to Knolygists I was dealing with this was in june at the time And they're like the soonest you can be seen as august so it was just like terrible health care I was in a bad situation and had to and was really messed up You know and it all kind of like was a perfect storm Like a tree fell through the roof of my studio to and destroyed it by base player quit my drummer had already quit like I was Why did they quit? Various reasons. Yeah, I mean like really the drummer and the base player are totally separate things the drummer is just kind of a jerk And the base player was a dear friend time for him to move on unrelated to that, you know Like that's the tough thing going through a lot of this stuff even in relation to my ex Of that's obviously what it seems like then is like you defer to the fact of like oh, you're transitioning Is it related to that why like certain things fell apart? Sometimes I wonder about that but at the same time like it did set off a chain of like a bunch of changes are now Going to take place within your life, you know and a lot of that is just the way it is in life And all the sudden question starts moving. Yeah, it is but and and I don't mind taking Like I don't mind accepting all the blame for anything I just would hate to ever put blame or put any kind of guilt on someone else Oh, if you didn't know that for sure, you know, like they were reacting to exactly like I can't say that about anyone And I and if they do feel that way then that's fine and fair and that's totally cool But I would hate for them to ever feel guilt for feeling anything like that Right, right, right you just so you're empathetic to the struggle that they may have within themselves Totally everyone processes like, you know, the news of someone coming out in that way in a different way. I think you know Well, I think it's like, you know coming out in this way, you know, is it is a relatively Newish thing You know, because I like you said, I mean, I I don't know that you know everywhere You can just make this decision and enact it and enact it I mean coming out as a as a gay person. I mean that's sort of been around a while Right, but you know something sort of like all right because there's more to understand I would think for some people like wait So you're how far is this gonna go when you know, what what is how are you oriented? Like there's other questions if someone says i'm gay they're like, oh, okay So that's what you are then but this is you know a little more complicated in a way I think in a way though that also those questions which are really heavily placed on you when you first come out Yeah, can often like Create this pressure on a trans person person that's unrealistic because you're asking someone who's trans to explain something They don't understand totally they're just taking a step and they're saying I identify in a way that's different than you probably identify We're gonna call that trans. Okay. Now. I'm taking the step to figuring out what that means and figuring out what I want to do Maybe that means rehormone replacement therapy. Maybe that means eventual surgeries Yeah, but it doesn't always have to right, you know, sure so placing this pressure to like you have to give an answer now You're gonna get surgery you're going on hormones. What are you gonna do? You know, like yeah, they creates this like mine fuck of a pressure like cooker where you're just like, I don't know And especially when you do it publicly and you're like doing interviews and yeah and people want to You have to have like this so that set of answers so that happens that was pressure. Yeah, yeah And that contributed to the breakdown. I think so like you like should I know the answer these questions? Do I do I need to do it to appease them? Yeah? I'm like it gets in your head where you're like what? I don't what am I doing as that's reactionary or what am I doing because I need to fit into someone else's understanding of An interpretation of gender or what am I doing because it actually makes me feel more right in my body? Right, that's hard to do in the public eye. That's hard to do out of the public eye That's hard to do in general. Sure. It's just it's it's interesting to me because you know, I you know, I I have my own Like I don't know how to talk about it. I'd imagine that most people talk about it So I this is the best way to talk about it. No, I think you know, no absolutely But like I'd imagine the the reactionary kind of like sensationalizing thing In a conversation publicly about this in an oppressed situation. They may not try be trying to be sensationalistic They're just sort of like what what's happening? You know, what are you gonna do now? Do you have a vagina? When does that happen? Is that what here does in progress? I mean Like I think there's a there's a fascination that may or may not come from the right place But it's still there right and and I never really I guess the the empathy necessary for For for the culture to sort of understand that you don't have those answers is a new thing Totally and it's you know, it's it's it's interesting. This is like this is new new shit. It's a brave new world It is uh-huh like because I go up like I've made bad jokes before in my life But sometimes I think that in order for a culture to transition with you Uh-huh, you know, you a lot of times people are just laughing because they're uncomfortable. Sure. That's a legitimate like response that happens Yeah, you know, and it's a much better one than violence Right or fuck you or immediate boxing of the person. Mm-hmm I mean it is a sign of internalized transphobia that you you've been ingrained with by growing up in a society that is Transphobic, you know, that's taught to you. That's taught to me. That's what like instilled That's how I knew without it wasn't like my parents sat me down one day and they were like don't be transsexual. All right Yeah, that wasn't on the menu right right so you learn about it because you see like oh since Sacialized like headlines and like supermarket stands. Oh silence of the lambs. Oh like ace Ventura Oh, like, you know, all these things are thrown at you where it's usually the butt of the joke. It's a scary thing It's obviously an unacceptable thing. It's a laughable thing most of the time, but it's also just instilled in you too Yeah, but but also the thing that cuts through all that. I mean, you know, I think more than You know, whatever values someone might have or whatever ideas or expectations they might have it's it confronts their sexuality I I think that's that's like part of it. Why you know It's a conversation I've had with a friend of mine specifically in regards to transgender women You know and the levels of violence that that you know like they're subject to often and like why is it a violent reaction? And it has to do with you know, whether or not it challenges your sexuality of like so you look at a woman Right and you check her out and then you realize maybe oh shit that woman has a dick Right and that challenges your sexuality. Why right? But also like you're looking at the woman because it's a sexist patriarchal society And that's most men's immediate When they look at a woman, but I'm not saying checking her out and then they realize like oh this This person doesn't fit what I thought they fit and now this somehow is in a front to my sexuality But it does sort of provoke something where it's sort of like it's initially confusing And if feelings happen within somebody, you know how they're gonna interpret them like there It's a new experience That is sexual sure yeah, I mean in that context is a sexual experience Yeah, but I'm saying that the root of that Yeah has to do with more of like that. It's a sexist society sure and that that's the way it works Um, but I also say to back that to back up for a second or on a related note or whatever too If you look at the number of people looking at transsexual porn on the internet It's si-assist men, you know like those are the people who are looking at transsexual course Are our straight men sure you know like so what does that say then too? Yeah, it's okay to do it in the closet But if you're caught doing it in real life, then you like it's I don't know if I'd assume that they're all closeted because they're watching that porn There might not be no I'm just saying they don't know how to interpret what they're feeling You know, they don't realize that that they're attracted to that person because they're a woman despite the fact that their genitals might be a little different Than another woman's but in my experience with all the women that I've slept with They all have pretty different pussies or fucking whatever. You know like they do Yeah, same with same with Cox You know Was the point of getting into that I don't remember I thought But um, so where are you at with the whole thing with the whole thing? I don't know I'm just living right. No, I don't know. I'm just living You know, I'm feeling a good place But in the treatments and they're like, how does it mean the words you level off I mean you went through you had the the nervous breakdown your on medicine And and hormones and estrogen that we're not balanced properly Is that something you know as you transition that you you wean yourself off of do you hit a level with it? No, well, can you taking these pills? I mean, it's it would depends on who you go to but like so there was the level I was getting in health care in florida when I moved to chicago chicago's informed consent where you can go into a doctor So this is what i'm doing and you get access to hormones got much better health care in in chicago And then I've been on injectables since I've lived in chicago And that's something you have to just keep doing yeah once a week you give a shelf self a shot And and and you're you're leveled off with the with the process now You're good. I don't know you're good. I mean, I again, I'm I feel way more comfortable about myself I'm happy. I'm doing what i'm doing. It's really hard to transition when you tour like Traveling like it's hard for me to get refills of prescription, you know, like It's hard for me to make appointments to go through things like electrolysis, you know I don't know like all this stuff is stuff. I think about constantly It's not like all of a sudden I was like and on you know like no, but like you I'm just doing me, but do you feel like do you like you now that you're into it? Like what has it been two years? 2012 is when I came up so three years But since you've you know actively been doing the therapies to transition it's been like three years Yeah, now are you feeling like I guess my question is around You know what you were freaking out about before in terms of the questions You know like like now that you've sort of started this thing are you like no? Okay? Or do you are you looking to do more? I feel like that I have a much better understanding of Of what I need and what makes me feel right than I did three years ago Certainly more than I did 10 years ago 20 years ago, right? But I feel like that in another three years another four years another five years I'll even haven't even better understanding of who I am and what I need I don't think that that's something that you can ever fully feel Like complete with or anything really or at least for me huh Okay I guess so I mean but that's sort of like to me like it's a it's sort of like like With drugs or something like that or or that feeling of not being complete in other ways you know like that is Is there something are you doing anything else around the psychology of Of dysphoria that isn't you know transition related? Did you ever address other issues to your discomfort mentally or I'm trying to you know like I I am an existentialist, you know and I like I oftentimes feel locked in thinking about things and thinking about the bigger picture of things and what certain things mean and You know, I don't know how to reconcile with my life beyond where my tortaits end Yeah, and that that's like I live a really weird life I know but like well what if you were to quiet a town? I mean, what do you like I like see like I'm a guy. I'm a recovery guy So I haven't done shit in like 15 16 years, you know that that was my problem, right? But do I feel whole and complete all the time? No, I feel better about myself I feel comfortable in my skin, but there's still something like, you know, what does it all mean? What's the fucking point? Yeah, so, you know that hasn't gone away. No, I very much still have that That's there. I don't want that to go away in a way, you know, I know I think that's that's it sure it is Yeah, but you should have some peace of mind Yeah, I mean, it's a trip, you know, like and like I can't imagine that I mean to cut you up But I can't imagine though like it took me like, you know years like I don't think I arrived in my body Uh until maybe five or six years ago Just you know when I started to get successful and feel like that I'd worked very hard on all my life to do something It was a self-esteem problem. Sure, you know, and it just sort of happened organically, but I felt it happen So I imagine on some level that you know you taking this you know, this making this transition has given you some of that I mean your self-esteem must be better and your comfort level set 100% My problems now I guess are more just like normal problems of like, um going through another divorce, you know And like oh, I got to deal with the fact that like I work and I travel and I have a kid And how do I balance like traveling life with having a kid and being able to be a part of my kid's life When I'm not necessarily getting along with the mother, you know, like Those are just like the realities of life that everyone has those are minimal problems to what other people Problems are, you know, I have it really good and that I enjoy what I do. I really love playing music I really love traveling. How's the community responded to all this? Um, you mean the community as in like music community or the punks the punks have been really supportive and really cool Yeah, a hundred percent no dicks there's been some dicks But I mean there's always a couple dicks and then like like people that ain't read the comments But you know, but I mean they mean bigger by I mean bigger dicks I mean like are there any is there have you had any experience with people that you respected or other musicians that have have reacted poorly No, that's good. No, uh-uh and that's something. Yeah, it's it's been really surprising, you know Yeah in a great way and the band mates band mates totally cool. Yeah. Yeah, it's really not big that big of a deal I think is what most people like get after a second. They're just like oh, okay You just like would prefer me to use feminine pronouns with you And then we're gonna practice at the same time and we're gonna go on tour and we'll hang out and have a fun Fun time and you'll have the same sense of humor like the same thing. You just look a little bit like yeah and cool That's what we're doing, you know like great easy Do you get attention from men? Um, what do you mean? I mean sexual attention since you've liked it transitioned this much. I guess I don't know You want to look sexy, don't you sometimes you want to look pretty down here? Sure. Yeah, I mean like I liked you know, I'm the singer in a band I'm a little bit like arrogant and vain too where I think like everyone maybe has a thing for me to a certain extent So I that's the way I carry myself through the world, right? That's good. That's I think that's a good rock and roll position to have right all right, so This the new record's done you're touring on this record and you're big like I didn't like you know I feel bad because I'm so out of the loop, but I mean you have a big following We have a popular band. They have a modest following that I'm very happy with and I really like I believe me. I understand I have a modest following as well Wasn't that modest to me? It was pretty good But what do would you well how's your ego? Do you want more? Do you always want more? Do you want to be big? You want to stadium rock? I mean everyone does and especially like you I don't it makes me paralyzed with fear to Really to try to well I'm a stand-up though, and it's very personal in a way that you know That's just me up there. So the idea of me performing for 10,000 people. It's sort of like what could they want from me Honestly, like I'm happy that anyone wants to see me. I mean that like genuinely Of course like you want to feel like you're progressing and doing new things And I don't want to feel like I'm just playing the same club over and over and over again You know and that it's never changing. So you do want to feel like growth. That's like natural I feel like an a healthy thing sure and ambition is a good thing sure and wanting to feel like you're Reaching more people especially it's so hard in the music industry these days where things are so skewed where it's like, you know Like each record we've sold or each record we put out last three records Has charted higher. Yeah, but like ultimately sold less You know what I mean? Like it's a little less for sure, but the chart position is higher So like you you know you you want some sign that you're still relevant in the music industry I don't know. Well, I mean sometimes it's just about the people who come Sales are tricky, you know, I've only really talked to a I've talked some you know big old dudes You know musician wise and a few young dudes, but the only other real like Honest punk that I talked to was you know Patrick Stickles from Titus and dronicus. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah He's a piece of work But like, you know, it seems like you guys I mean in good way and he's he's yeah, he's something But like it seems like you know When you're at the level you're at it's just about touring constantly. Yeah, totally. Yeah, and but that's what we've always been You know, we we've always been a band that was about and you've got original guys what you still Um, my best friend James where I met on the first day of high school is my guitar player still to this day So yeah, that's sweet and you get along and fat Mike plays on your records He played a couple on a couple songs on that record on transgender dysphoria blues Yeah, it's good record.

Yeah for sure, you know, I mean like she I mean, she's a mom. Yeah, she worries. She's a parent Yeah, I know like I think she was just wants me to be happy Yeah, yeah, that is what they want you think I think so.
