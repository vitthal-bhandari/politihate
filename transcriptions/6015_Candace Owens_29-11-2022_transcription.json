    "text": " What if this actually happened ready? What if I tweeted one day that the CIA and the Mossad were going to attempt to frame me and then torture me to death? And then four hours after that tweet I was found dead in an ocean. What would you think? You think that it was just an accident at the timing of my tweet was suspicious and then I naturally drowned? I'm asking you that question for a reason. I'm asking you because it's actually happened to somebody and This story that I read completely sent a shiver up my spine. I think that it will send one up yours as well Plus later on in the show We're going to be talking about thousands of convicted pedophiles in California Who are being released from prison in less than a year for horrific acts including rape sodomy and sexual abuse of children under 14 According to a new investigation all that and more today coming up on cana stones You Alright you guys so first and foremost I want to say that it makes me so happy to see that There are still issues that can unite people on the left and the right that there is not a gray area when it comes to pedophilia and when it comes to grooming children and That is the reason that hashtag Balenciaga rumors has been trending for over a week now people are upset people are going after the Kardashians and it feels like finally We are agreeing on a moral issue. I love that except there is one group of people that are noticeably silent People in Hollywood they seem like they just want this to go away They have no interest in leaning in and this is bizarre because they love leaning in on political issues They love cancel culture right Hollywood love perpetuating cancel culture let you be found in a MAGA hat and they want you canceled Let George Floyd be killed. They want black squares They want something to scream about and something to say I am a virtuous person So it's bizarre that they're being super silent and of course this is leading to conspiracy theories Conspiracy theories one that keeps popping up which is that there is an elite pedophile ring Operating within Hollywood that seems crazy, right? I was thinking about this and thinking about the Epstein case Jeffrey Epstein of course We all know that case we have been following it in the news people believe that he was murdered in prison other people believe that he legitimately hung himself Doesn't matter. I'm not ish. I'm not interesting going down that path. Well, I'm interested in covering today though It's something that I never spoke about before which is that when this case was going on a lot of people were sending the information Claiming get this and I'm going to be clear at this this sounded to me like a conspiracy theory that Jeffrey Epstein was a part of our intelligence agencies, right? That he was actually operating a black male ring and this is the reason why nobody would prosecute him because he was a protected CIA Asset, right? So the idea is that Jeffrey Epstein would get very powerful people to attend his party We bring them out on the little lead to express. We bring him to his island in the Caribbean remember he somehow had enough money to purchase an entire island little St. James and He would get them to sleep with women Maybe unbeknownst to them that these women were very young and then he'd have blackmail you've recorded the acts and then suddenly He had control over people all around the world because hey if you don't do what we say We're going to show this video of you sleeping with a 14 year old that sounds crazy, right? I thought it sounded crazy and so I never reported on it I just sort of stayed out of it and just reported on the strangeness They miss up absolutely of course it was bizarre that this man seemed to keep falling through the cracks of our legal system Despite all of the evidence that he was involved in sex crimes And by the way this conspiracy theory of him operating a black male ring didn't come from nowhere actually came from somewhere It came from Alexander Acosta being just one individual that leaned into this conspiracy theory It he was the former US attorney if you don't remember Alexander Acosta He was a former US attorney who was also selected by President Trump to be the labor secretary of the United States and Throughout his confirmation hearings a lot of people in the press were saying this guy allowed Jeffery Epstein to get off Scott free and So throughout his interviews with the Trump administration He was asked about that and he asked the question is the Epstein case going to cause a problem Perching to his confirmation hearings. He had been He explained breezily apparently that back in the day. He had had just one meeting on the Epstein case He'd cut the non-prosecution deal with one of Epstein's attorneys because he out at her costa had been told to back off That Epstein was above his pay grade. He said quote. I was told Epstein Belonged to intelligence and to leave it alone. He told interviewers in the Trump transition So that obviously makes people believe that it's true that he Alexander Acosta was simply told hey You got to let this guy go He's an asset and that would sort of make sense as to why he kept slipping through the cracks of the legal system But there's more there's more stuff that is the reason that people believe that this is all true In case you miss this in the news Jeffrey Epstein and by the way you can find these articles and NBC news the Washington Post This is not stuff that I'm finding on some conspiracy website. This is known in the mainstream media that all this is true So Jeffrey Epstein used a foreign passport with a fake name to enter several countries in the 1980s including United Kingdom Spain and Saudi Arabia That is weird The passport contained a photo of Epstein with a different name and listed his place of residence as Saudi Arabia that's according to federal prosecutors now How bizarre is that they open a safe and they find a passport a working passport which allows him to get into all of these countries and It's a fake name which lists his residence in Saudi Arabia Who would have the power to issue a fake? passport to Jeffrey Epstein It's a fact that he had a fake passport and a fact that he used that big passport to enter different countries It is a fact that nobody can explain how he was wealthy enough to purchase I to purchase an island It is a fact that he kept slipping through the legal system. It is a fact that Alexander Acosta Said that he was told to let him go who would have that much power I'm just going to ask you the questions. I don't even need to spin a conspiracy I just need to actually present the facts to you Then of course was the strange case of Gellene Maxwell and her father her father died under mysterious circumstances this is from a Washington Post article in 1991 father's name was Robert Robert Maxwell the article says Maxwell whose body was recovered from the Atlantic Ocean off the Canary Islands last Tuesday after he disappeared from his yacht Was buried late this afternoon in Judaism's most prestigious spot the cemetery of Jerusalem's Mount of Olives facing the Western Wall His funeral service in Jerusalem's Hall of the People was attended by a host of Israeli politicians led by Prime Minister Shamir and President Herzog who eulogized the self-made tycoon as a man cast in a heroic mold Okay, so the conspiracy theories online was that Jeffrey Epstein was linked to the massage and the CIA and that he was an asset and What added to that theory? I should say because I cannot confirm this I don't want you to walk away and say can't it's confirmed This is true was that Gellene Maxwell's father had a lot of power a lot of power and Israel You have a hell powerful person you have to be to get both the president and the prime minister to attend your funeral And he also died in mysterious circumstances, right? Just kind of drowned it. Yeah, now why am I bringing this up today? obviously because as I said, I was happy to see that people have been so vocal and So consistent in their response against Balenciaga's campaign and realizing that something weird is happening in Hollywood And it seems to me that I would I would never suggest that all of these celebrities that are staying quiet are all pedophiles That would seem too ridiculous to me But I do think they're fearful of something and maybe it's something vain like Kim Kardashian Just not wanting to not get those free clothes from Balenciaga Maybe they're scared maybe they understand that there is something that is more powerful than them And they have seen people that I've tried to speak against powerful systems, right? And they've had their entire lives ruined Something very very strange happened and I want to bring this to your attention because it requires your attention It requires your thought and I want you to focus on this There was a man who was a cryptocurrency millionaire and as you know, there's a lot going on in the crypto world right now and One of the things that was going on is that a lot of very young Cryptomillionaires and billionaires are being found dead in the last couple of weeks three of them have been found dead in mysterious circumstances, okay, so Nikolai Michigan Michigan part of my part in me 29 years old he died on October 28th Hours after tweeting that he feared the CIA and the Mossad were going to murder him This is it's not gonna speak to her. He tweeted this actually his tweet read quote the CIA and the Mossad and pedo elite are running some kind of sex trafficking entrapment black male ring out of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean islands They are going to frame me with a laptop planted by my ex-girlfriend who was a spy. They will torture me to death a black male ring operating out of Puerto Rico and The Caribbean the Caribbean obviously well one thing that's true is that Epstein had an island in the Caribbean Right just off the coast of St. Thomas and Tortola Is an island little St. James that is where his island was and again It was a theory that he was a part of a black male ring, but that sounds crazy that sounds he just guy tweets this Okay, doesn't mean that it's cheery tweets that and then what happens? Oh four hours later. He was found dead He was found dead by a surfer in Puerto Rico and you might think okay Candace well, maybe he went for a swim and he happened to drown Maybe he didn't know but he couldn't swim. Maybe the waves were bad that day and he went first for him I want to believe that because I would much rather believe that there was not something sinister going on in our world I'd much rather believe that this was just odd timing that he drowned Except the facts around this case are that he was found in all of his clothes as well as having his wallet in his pocket Okay, so you would have to believe that he regularly went for a swim in all of his clothes and with his wallets In Puerto Rico after tweeting that he thought that the CIA the Messiah were gonna kill him That's what you would have to believe if you wanted to say I'm a side of believing that there is not something more sinister happening That wasn't his only tweet by the way. He also tweeted three possible futures for me one Suicided by CIA to CIA brain damage slave asset three Worst nightmare of people who effed with me up until now. I am sure these are the only options he tweeted that on September 4th and Yeah, if I read that tweet and he was still alive, I would think that he was just crazy, but he's not he is dead He's not the only person the crypto world as I mentioned earlier that has died There was another man named Tan Tan Koolinder 30 years old who died in his sleep last week Which is bizarre and there was another one who just died yesterday his name is Yashlav Tehran part of my pronunciation here 53 years old He died after his helicopter plunged near the resort town in Switzerland After taking off from Luzon on a clear day If no understanding of why the helicopter would have crashed there was no weather issues and There was another person that was supposed to get onto the helicopter that last minute decided not to so Yeah, it is getting a bit strange and I am not sure what is going on I do not believe that all of these people are dying in mysterious circumstances and that they're all just happening upon their deaths accidentally I I Am fearful to even have this discussion, you know, I think it's it's a scary idea It's it's scary. My brain does not want to believe that there Can be this many pedophiles in power does not want to believe that there could be something sinister happening that our CIA that our intelligent agencies are involved in but I do know that This story scares me and it's important that I bring it to the forefront and that you know that it is taking place and I will just read your comments and see what you all think about it and that's all I'm going to say about that Alright guys Christmas is just around the corner and although the world wants you to focus on presence in Santa Let's not lose sight of a Christmas is really all about to help you remember the reason for the season Hello invites you to join their most anticipated prayer challenge of the year pray 25 led by cast members from the chosen the largest Christian streaming series in history Pray 25 will guide you through meditation and prayer for 25 days leading up to Christmas Pray 25 will help grow your understanding of mankind and develop a disciplined prayer habit during a season when discipline is put to the test Download halo for free today and join the Pray 25 challenge go to halo.com slash candace and get three months completely free That's halo.com slash candace to reclaim your peace during this holiday season Okay, now it's time for some topics to do Okay, so obviously I Wish that we could just cover happy topics all day long I mean it just it beats me down that this is the depressive state of things today But it is so much more important to me that everybody is informed Especially if you're like me and you're a mother to two young children I want to know everything that's going on in the school systems I want to know exactly what to look out for I want to be able to make a decision about where I should live So reason I picked up moved my family away from a liberal city because this stuff is real and unfortunately We don't talk about it. They certainly aren't going to when I say they I'm talking about The Department of Education your teachers print the principles the teachers are not going to tell you what's going on Because the entire point of all of this is to disrupt the family unit We talk about California all the time because it is an actual communist country that happens to be in the United States But it's its own communist country and I have said to my listeners over and over again move if you live in California Move I do not believe that they run a fair election process I believe that Gavin Newsom is a dark character and He is hell bent on destroying the people of California. It's just not worth I don't believe it's worth the fight there anymore if you have young children and To add weight to that claim thousands of convicted pedophiles in California are now being released from prison Less than a year after committing horrific acts horrific acts including rape sodomy and sexual abuse of kids under 14 so this is actually going on the Daily Mail has been reporting on this and It's more than 7,000 sex offenders who are convicted of lewd acts with the child under 14 of age Of age but were let out of prison the same year if they were incarcerated Data from California Megan's laws Megan's law database says so I don't know why they're doing this We've obviously been talking a lot about this that we're seeing people that are put into places of power that are making sure of Laws are really lenient against pedophiles I'm just pedophiles also murderers people that commit crime It seems that they are trying to fill the street to the criminals and I am not sure why I cannot Understand why other than to want to see chaos and to want terrible things to happen But we are seeing the crime rates keep trekking up in these inner-city communities, but especially in California There are coagos on to say that others who committed some of the worst child sex crimes on the statute books served similarly Short sentences including three hundred and sixty-five pedophiles convicted of continuous sexual abuse of a child who spent less than 12 months in prison 39 cases of sodomy with a child under 16 and three cases of kidnapping a child under 14 with intent to commit lewd acts according to the data Former Los Angeles sex crimes prosecutor Samuel Dordullian told the Daily the Daily Mail that he was shocked by the statistics And he described them as frightening for society And I think that frightening is the perfect adjective to describe exactly what's going on It's frightening to think that for whatever reason these people are being thrown on to the streets And I just do not understand and honestly comment you guys know I read your comments What would keep somebody tethered if you have a family and you have a young family? What would keep you tethered to the inner-city communities? I understand there's work opportunities But I can't imagine choosing work over the safety of my children Especially when there seems to be a government sponsored incentive to put the children at risk whether it's in the classroom whether it's on the streets This is happening The statistics clearly show that pedophiles don't get reformed by the way. They're going to come out and they're going to commit again Obviously because you have to be far gone I mean so mentally deluded to commit a sex act against a small child a minor child and The fact that we people are being let out and you have all the statistics that are showing that they are likely to commit those same crimes again Should have every single person concerned So I just wanted to bring that to your attention because I also talk about just aside from the criminals the criminal The criminality in Los Angeles the crime of even if when you're a parent you have no say over your children's health They have also the state has really squeezed in on that your children cannot go to school even if you homeschool now They get to tell you whether or not you have to back your child how many vaccines to give them if firm a state of California so I just do not perceive it as a free state whatsoever and Unless there is something Unbelievable tethering you there. It's time to pick up and move like I did with my family not away from California But away from inner city to indies.

I want to move on and to discuss Joe Biden's non binary drag queen nuclear waste guru in case you missed it you remember the picture of the photo of the guy that was wearing heels and I guess he had something to do with What was that stuff that he was involved in puppy play? He would dress up and it was some weird better study had well It doesn't matter because he is working for your tech dollars Going to support him I guess is the best way to say it his name is Sam Britain and his full title is the DOE's deputy assistant secretary of the office of spent fuel and waste disposition and he's now been accused of Taking a bag he was caught on camera stealing a bag from Minneapolis's airports baggage claim And if he's found guilty he could face five years in jail a ten thousand dollar fine or both I want to be very clear. He's not gonna face any of that because Hunter Biden is roaming the streets freely and he's a crackhead who's got pornography on the laptop and so I I mean, I don't even it is the idea that anybody connected to Joe Biden is ever going to be made an example of or that They're ever going to have to face up for their crimes is a long running joke at this point But if he actually did actually pay for his crimes, that's what it would be You know this guy as I said proudly announced on LinkedIn that he had become the assistant secretary of spent fuel And he's been very in our face, but yes, they caught him out toward 27 Taking a bag a navy blue hard-sided roller bag from a baggage claim carousel and the bag was reported missing by a woman Earlier in the day after reviewing a lot of the surveillance videos She was able to identify the bag with a total value of items stolen approximately two thousand three hundred and twenty five dollars Okay, so here is why the story is a strange one It's strange because Brinton was in the airport having arrived in a flight from Washington DC, but he didn't check a bag So he didn't check a bag So why would he go to baggage claim to collect a bag if he hadn't checked one? So law enforcement was were able to quickly track him down and he denied it You completely denied taking anything which is weird because when you're at least oh no I took a bag, but it was my bag. So that's the mix up. This is this is my bag and you open and go actually So after denying it then he had to change apart and he called the airport police They said okay, actually no, I I lied a little bit. I wasn't being completely honest I did take a blue bag from the airport again He never checked a bag in so it's completely bizarre then he lies. He says he took nothing now He's coming clean and saying okay. I did take a bag and it's it's getting a little weird Right so now he's saying that he was just a little tired and he took the suitcase Thinking that maybe it was his even though he didn't check a bag Sounds like he might be a liar and by the way, this is a very weird thing It's how crazy you have to be just go into take a flight get off of a plane I don't how tired do you have to be to stand at baggage claim? Okay, and think that you checked to wait for a bag that you never checked To take it and then to forget that you took it and lie to law enforcement I didn't take anything and then to call them and say oh just kidding. I did take something But I'm not I'm not really sure why why I took it. This is just weird It's weird spasar British is jumping into carousel eight and grabbing a blue bag and pretending you didn't because you were tired now I know tired. I'm a mom Okay, I've traveled flights with two toddlers well one toddler and a newborn with absolutely no sleep overseas never once when we landed never once Did I go to a baggage carousel? I have after having not Checked a bag and taken somebody else's then and forgot I didn't it told the police now it wasn't me so This guy's probably gonna lose his job if things are right in the world But they're not right in the world so he's probably gonna get a promotion from Joe Biden Promotion and an astounding defense from Joseph Biden who probably doesn't even know that he works for him Moving on you guys. I hate to cover her, but I'd like to cover her Today because she's so ridiculously crazy Julia Fox I don't know what on earth possessed Kanye to date her for what was it two three weeks and now she's writing a book on there War romance and now she's come out and she has said you know I only dated him to protect came Kardashian because she's like obsessed with the Kardashian family You can definitely tell and so she talks about them on TikTok like if those are my girls She's also just as a side note You can just park this deeply unattractive inside and outside, but she's now doing a video trying to explain to you that Hollywood's not weird and Balenciaga thing isn't weird and the problem is men take a listen You guys love saying the like Holly weird all the pedophiles and Holly weird Listen up faces. There's pedophiles in every industry. You want to go be a chef? You'll probably have some abusers over there. You want to go be a teacher abusers over there You want to go be an engineer abusers over there. This isn't an issue with Hollywood. This is an issue with the fashion world This isn't an issue with celebrities. This is the next year with man got Yeah Yeah, that's totally stable She's a totally stable person. You should just believe everything she says and so it's not an issue with Hollywood guys There's pedophiles everywhere if you want to be a chef as she says you should just expect How many pedophiles there is pedophiles making your pasta when you go to the restaurant? You should just expect that and the issue isn't the fact that there are sick twisted people in the world The issue is men. It's always men Which is strange to me because I'm pretty sure the fashion industry isn't exactly run by straight men And I'm pretty sure as we covered yesterday a lot of these photos Their main stylist is actually a woman who's involved in some weird satanic stuff and her whole Instagram is littered with references to the devil and Blood with babies and was a woman But you know the great thing about being a feminist Which is something that Julia Fox says that she is is that you never have to take responsibility for anything Has meant is the beauty of being a modern feminist no matter what happens no matter what you do No matter if you're staring at something straight in the face And it's so obvious that women have a hand in it all you have to do is say Actually, it's it's the fault of men So yeah, that's all that I have to say about that If you're looking for a meaningful gift for your loved one this year You've got to check out legacy box legacy box is a simple and safe way to digitally preserve your treasured videotapes Film reels and photos.

So be nice people first comment coming from madline She writes I bet after the response came was like no matter what I do. It's not enough Obviously, this is about Kim came Blenciaga welcome Yeah, it isn't because you haven't done the right thing You just wrote some letters and hoped that it'll deflate just like astral world did All we wanted was for you to say I'm done with them and the world would have praised you till the end of time That's it if you lost millions out of the billions that you have everyone was so quick the judge cognates so quick even gg Where is she now? Where is everyone now? Cricut as candace said silence has never been more powerful now not after event data But I truly hope this is the end of the masses worshiping these celebs and trends Blenciaga's apology is embarrassing to say volisse They've addressed only what they wanted not a single thing about all of the other props that were so obnoxious in our face But hey, it's fine. Let's forgive them right people make mistakes bless them No, it's so so wrong and if this goes away and people will still be shopping with them in a month or two We do deserve all of this. I like the end of that that we do deserve all this So sometimes I wonder because it feels like we present people with all of the facts and then people just do not change their minds Like it's so easy to not follow Kim Kardashian. It's so easy to not pick up a $3,000 bag from Blenciaga following this It's so easy to make an effort to say I draw a line somewhere in that place that I draw a line Is pedophilia. It's that easy right? I draw a line of pedophilia So if you are a celebrity and you are pretending that you are processing what happened and you're still going to work with these people I draw a line at you and I I will never purchase any Kardashian products of it knowing Unless they have a partial partial ownership somewhere. I'm not aware of it I will not purchase any other products. I'm really I really do think that it is despicable We also covered yesterday the assisted suicide ad which was something that I have been very passionate about because it's very obvious To me that they are going to try to glamorize assisted suicide and encourage people with all sorts of mental disorders To simply kill themselves and because it's it's already happening. It's not something that I'm thinking up It's already happening. There have been cited examples of just that People coming forth and saying I'm not suicidal. I'm just in debt and the hospital is encouraging me to kill myself in Canada Well, miss mu writes to me As a Canadian and someone who works on an oncology surgical unit in a hospital I agree with maid that is the government program in Canada maid For the terminally for the terminally ill no human should ever have to suffer However, I don't think that our government should use it to rid our country of its less fortunate or mentally ill population We need better resources to help back for people. My father died of cancer. It wasn't nice to witness at all My sister-in-law's mother used our maid program as well as a few of my patients They were suffering and it got them out of their own personal hell It was the best decision for those people as I said I believe that the slope is incredibly slippery Once you give the hospital that permission and give people that option to be able to kill themselves Of course as and as we are seeing it is going to be abused by the government and individuals are going to want those pills to end their lives prematurely And that's good for the government. The government doesn't want a burden. They don't want a financial burden and as a christian person I I just cannot get on board with the maid program whatsoever Next question remember we covered the velveta lawsuit yesterday the woman who was like hey It actually takes longer than it should to make this velveta cheese. I think on the package it says Three minutes and this woman realized it takes a little more so she's now suing the craft company Well, this person writes The lady about the macaroni isn't wrong and it does take longer because it takes four minutes in my microwave But this is not a lawsuit plus it depends on the microwave on how long it takes I have a bad feeling. Let's just going to win this she won't get all that money But she'll get some and then they'll change the label in some way Yeah, your bad feeling is probably accurate. Welcome to america where you can sue for anything And they are probably going to say hey give this ridiculous woman a couple thousand dollars to make her go away Maybe they'll give her $40,000 or something to make her go away And then they're going to change the packaging because it needs to be cooked I don't know somehow the extra minute really kills people and this woman obviously Was unable to go on with her activities because it took her four minutes as opposed to three minutes And as I said that that story as funny as it is Also offers a very sad commentary on the state of things in our society In terms of the sloth and the laziness that we're suffering from intrinsically Last comment is from crystal sims. It is regarding the candis merch which you guys can get at yes We candis dot com see what I did there. Uh-huh.
