    "text": " Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Saragansola. We are here with your top stories of the day. Glenn, what is yours? I just want to spend a little additional time on the Muslim brides. They're so they're precious. They are seven brides for seven Mohammed's. This is a new bachelor. Yes, it is. It is. It is. Well, Sarah, I was concerned in previous conversations we've had that you may not understand socialism. You seem to be negative about it. So I have to present to you from the Washington Post the five myths of socialism. From the Washington Post. Yes. So the New York Times has their own version now too. Oh, really? Yeah. Wow. Good. It's good. Good. Jason. A little Twitter trigger that hit me last night. But it's the reason why the youth now is thinking that socialism is OK now. And various people within our own government that are actively trying to rewrite history. I feel like you have a lot of Twitter triggers. That's what I'm saying. Maybe you should just like take an anger management class. Or maybe not be on Twitter. Or just start screaming, I'm on. But. All right, a lot to get into. But first, we want to thank our sponsor American Financing. American financing is the place to go. If you are looking for a refi, if you are looking for a loan for a new house, now is the time to buy a new house. Please do not buy more of a house than you should have. I I speak from experience. But make sure that you are doing everything you can to get a locked in rate at these low interest rates right now. The people I trust are American financing. It's a family owned business, been in business for a very long time, I don't know, 20, 30 years. And they they actually care about the customer. They're not in it to make kickbacks from the banks. They don't take any of those kickbacks. That's what sets them apart. They work for you at American financing. You can find them at 800-906-2440 or American financing.net. Glenn, the the Muslim brides, the Isis bride. I love them. I love their so sweet. Well, they're misguided. You know, who didn't make a mistake when you were 19 years old? That's true. We all did. Yeah, that's true. And some of their mistakes are maybe a little bigger than you know, the mistakes I made and I made some whoppers. But I never really called for, you know, beheading people, going to a Veteran's Day parade and shooting everybody or driving a truck into the crowd. Never. Never. Not once. Not once. Well, I mean, look, I didn't see every one of your tweets back the end of the day, but I just can't believe. Right. OK, I mean, this is not an error of judgment. Today, there's new video from NBC News of this sweet American girl who just wants to go home and out to Alabama, sweet home Alabama, dare I say. And she said it was just a face. It was just a face. Watch. A lot of people are going to find that hard to believe after some of the the tweets that you put out. I know I know that, but it was an ideology that really was just a face. There's one tweet in particular where you talk about calling out Americans to do drive-by shootings, to rent a truck and drive over people spilling their blood and you say Memorial Day, Veterans Day, go out and do it. Again, mother, I told me not to speak about these things. Who, my mom? My mother or my lawyer? OK. It's a good advice, but whoever it was. You really should not talk about those things. Right. That same person, if it was your mom, should have said that you shouldn't tweet those things either. Look, the first thing as as Jason knows, the first thing that these people did was go over to a foreign country and burn their passports, right? Yep. So they denounce their citizenship. Then they take up arms against us. This is that they were fighting the US as well. So they take arms against us. She's, I mean, if a wife of an Islamic fighter, if that's not the epitome of comfort and aid to your enemies, I don't know what is. She was vicious all the way along as we lined up on the show just a few minutes ago. If you missed it, watch the Glenn Beck program on the blaze TV. But we lined it all up. This is this is someone who, according to the Constitution, the only the only law that is mentioned in the Constitution with a penalty is treason. We have enough witnesses for her on treason. Treason is very hard to prove. You have to have three or four witnesses, I think. Well, we got millions of witnesses. We know exactly what she did because she broadcast it and she also put it all out on Twitter. The penalty is death. Not, hey, come on back and we forgive you. Don't worry about it. You worked against the United States in the most evil and heinous ways. It's as if an American citizen saw what was happening in Auschwitz, saw it, saw the ovens, saw everything and then said, you know what, I'm going to go over there and give comfort to those guys. We would not welcome them back if they said, oh, you know what, it was just a phase, this whole extermination of the Jews thing. It was just a phase I was going through. No way. I have no, I have no sympathy for these women at all. And there's a, you need that there's a big, you know, clarification to make when it seems like some of these women are getting clumped in with all of the, the women that got caught in the caliphate. So I actually, I know a man right now that is with a group. That is caring for a lot of these women. The problem is it's very, very hard for them to tell who were the victims and who I think two weeks ago they had, it was like five to 10 suicide vest bombings from some of these women because they're charging straight at the caregivers and just blowing themselves up. I know how to tell who the good ones are. They don't have a suicide. Let me make this announcement. I was going to make it on on radio tomorrow. This last night or the night before Mercury one, the Nazarene fund was alerted of 50 slaves that had been captured. Christian and Yazidi women who had been captured and were being kept by the ISIS brothers and our team went in and we rescued and now have 21 of those girls. We got them out of captivity just last night. Wow. So amazing. And there's so many other. There's there's that's what really kills me is a lot of people don't even talk about that. There's I've seen a lot of conversation on, you know, when's this government going to do this? When's this government going to do that? And in the absence of all of the inaction and then really not knowing what to do, there's groups like Mercury one. There's there's organizations like the Nazarene fund and others that are out there just saying we'll take care of it. We'll take care of these people. But back to what I was saying is I have no sympathy for her. Like you said, she gave up her citizenship. She's not a citizen of the United States. I've heard other people say, yeah, she's a citizen. I think she actually said, yes, I'm a citizen. No, you're not. You gave up your citizenship. You gave up that right. You engaged in horrible, horrible things. Yes, against our government, but the people that they hurt the most were the ones right there in those countries. They committed crimes in Syria. They committed crimes in Iraq. That's that's all for the Iraqi and Syrian people to deal with as far as I'm concerned now. But I want to point out that we do not bring her back because she has violated the one. There's only one one in the Constitution and it is treason. And she has she has committed treason against the United States. It's when you go against your country, especially at a time of war and you give aid and comfort to our enemies. She left, denounced her citizenship, joined them, told people to kill us in the streets here. Where are you coward cowardly Americans? Stand up, kill them, slaughter them. That is treason. I think we're all mostly on the same page here. However, I think like there's a distinction that I'm wondering because you keep saying it's treason and you keep saying she's not a citizen. So like no, she was a citizen. Right. So do you bring her back and try for treason or you leave her over there? No, I'm fine. You're right over there. So let the series go. You don't think this constitutional provision should be enacted here? They should not try her for this crime that's outlined in the Constitution. Yes, I'm just being belligerent for the for the fun of it. It is I have no problem doing that. Why bog down the system? She'll be dead over there. I mean, the Syrian people are not going to take kindly to these these these ISIS brides. It's not going to be serious, but it's not going to be serious. Right? Even though I mean, because Syria is like they're not going to give them to the Assad regime. Right. I will tell you. I will tell you that we do work with the police force. I don't know what they call it over in Iraq and the and those guys beg us to give them, you know, if we if we get the if we get the slaves out, they beg us. Can you give us the address? Can you give us the address now? I mean, and they're not. They won't make it to trial because she's not really a citizen of anything. Right. If she announced her citizenship here, she doesn't become a citizen of wherever she is. She's not a Syrian citizen or an Iraqi citizen. Maybe isn't her dad the the council for Yemen for the UN or something like that? Yeah. There was some controversy on if she was ever it was a citizen at all because it was something. I don't remember the specifics, but he was like a delegate. He was here on like diplomatic for diplomatic diplomatic reasons. And his visa he was here illegally, I think, as Visa was not had already expired. So technically he wasn't even here legally. She wasn't here legally. It was very, very strange. When did that stop? Still, I want to move on to finally you can tell me why everything that I think about socialism is wrong. I along with the Washington Post just here to help you help you understand these basic things that you don't apparently get. Here are the five myths of socialism from the Washington Post. Number one is socialism is a signal coherent ideology. Now, at no point did any of us think it was coherent. However, their point here is that it's not a single ideology. And the way they describe this is well Lenin said he wanted a revolution and Mark said the powers of history would eventually bring people to socialism. And others say, well, we should just antagonize until we get what we want. And some people just say, you know what, let's just push for bigger programs and over time people will like them more and will eventually get to socialism. That's not a difference in ideologies, a difference in approach. That's progressivism versus revolution versus, you know, this is just it really isn't. The bottom line is socialism all includes, you know, the end of private ownership, the means of production eventually. People, some people walk slowly down that path. Some people run as fast as they can. It was the same point of progressivism. They were Fabian socialists and they said what set them apart was we don't want revolution. We agree with what happened in Russia. That's the new way to do it. But we don't agree with the revolution that was bloody in the streets. We'll get there by putting peace after peace and it will take us time, but we'll achieve the same ends. Myth number two, Sarah is socialism and democracy are incompatible. See, they work well together. The Washington Post wants you to know. And it's true. Venezuela is a great example of it. A bus driver was elected president of Venezuela. And now look how wonderful that's going. The problem with this, of course, is yes, at Kimes, they do elect their socialist dictator who then as soon as they get into trouble, turn into a dictator. And that's the way it ends. It may start as democracy, but it doesn't end that way. Because the people are too stupid or they're rising up against and we have to stop these people for us to be able to do socialism right. Myth number three, Sarah is all socialists want to abolish markets and private property. Their excuse for this one is completely laughable, which is again, they are giving you this timeline thing. You know, there's certain groups that have taken control and they haven't done all of that. They haven't abolished markets and ended private property in Europe, for example. Like those, first of all, those are largely market economies with a welfare state. It is different, as Glenn's pointed out many times, that it's not socialism, though it's on that road and moving that way. And may I ask you this question, are the socialists in Europe in any of those states that have the welfare state? Are they happy? Is it enough socialism or enough control? No, of course not. They always want to expand it. Correct. And that's why this road is there. So it doesn't always start with full abolishing of markets and private property, but even social, social democrats or democratic socialists very clearly say this is the goal. It's just a matter of how quickly do we get there. Next up, and this one, you probably really think Sarah, which is when socialism is tried, it collapses. Not true at all. Really? Yeah. Now, sure, you can point to nine zillion examples. But do we have the quote and they explain it very well in this one quote, communism certainly failed. But social democracy has arguably been the single most successful modern ideology or political movement. This is in someone typed that. And like it's so bonkers that it's hard to even put your arms around it. With what examples? Their point is, well, look at Europe. Europe has a lot of these programs and what they try to say, they try to distinguish between democratic socialists and social democracy. Now, if there is a distinction that the words are reversed, which is a big difference. Like the difference between national socialists and social nationalists. Right. Which one? I mean, one is an absolute five. The other one's perfectly fine. And the example they used was a Casio Cortez and Sanders, now Bernie Sanders, who's a socialist ideologue for half a century, right? The Washington Post explains to him that what he really means is he just wants New Deal liberalism. Now, of course, Vox went to democratic socialism and said, hey, by the way, you know, a lot of people are saying you guys just want New Deal liberalism and the ask to social democrats or democratic socialists that. And she said, absolutely not what we want. We know that part of that is a path to get there. But what we want to do is end capitalism and markets and profits blah, blah, blah, blah. So the last one here is number five. Socialism offers a ready-made solution to numerous current problems. Now, you'll notice that's a myth. And what I like about this is you can kind of get a translation of what they're doing. Can we get the five back up there again? Because this is like each one of them. Socialism is single coherent ideology. The thing that you're scared about isn't in the one that's coming. That's what Washington Post is telling you. It's not coherent. Look, a lot of people have a socialized ideas, but that's not this one. The one that we're pushing on you, that's not going to be the same. Socialism and democracy are incompatible. You can still vote it. It'll be wonderful. All socialist, one-o-abolish markets and private property. Not these guys, not a cazzio quartet. She's wonderful. When socialism is tried, it collapses. No, that's not true. It works really well. It's the most successful ideology there is. And the last one is specifically, I think, for Democrats, which is socialism offers a ready-made solution to numerous current problems. What they go on to say is, if we get the socialist stuff, if they get in control, it's not going to cure climate change. It's not going to cure inequality. It's not going to cure any of these things. It's just so you know, don't get your expectations up, because once this actually happens, it's not going to work. See, I read that differently. I read number five as, okay, what can we say that will make us look like we're actually... Try to be fair. Try to be fair. We've got to throw one in there. It's there one warning, I thought, to the left, right. It's the one thing, hey, it's on its surface. Hey, you guys, I know you think that they're going to solve all these problems. It's not going to happen like that. But that's preparing for this. It's not against it. It's just preparing people for the failure. The world is insane back in a minute. Well, it's insane, because now you understand the myths about social and something before. You didn't get it. I didn't think you were kidding me. Before we get back into the conversation, I want to thank our sponsor Real Estate Agents Itrust.com. Glenn, I guess you decided that it was not a good idea to just close your eyes, blindfold yourself, and pick someone out of a phone phone to get a real estate agent. How do you pick a real estate agent? I mean, internet or your brother's aunt's dog's cousin. Yeah, you just ask somebody usually, or I don't know, we bought the house from this person, right? That's the worst thing you can do. And I had this problem when I tried to sell my house, and we didn't know how to pick a real estate agent. And we ended up getting somebody that we knew, and they were like, okay, and it was not good. But we didn't know what we were doing. I started doing work with the 500 best real estate agents in the country, according to the Wall Street Journal. These are the people that sell the most houses, the volume of houses that these people sell. How many of them have reality shows? I think every real estate agent has a reality. Yeah, I don't think so. So in talking to them, I realized that there's a pattern, A, they're doing it full time, B, they've done it for a long time, C, they are very specific on the areas that they're in. They have done it so long that they know what that household sold for the last time, what the house is around sold for, what houses like that are selling for, and they have it off the top of their head. So it's no algorithm can sell it. The most important thing is they advertised the home, not them. We all go for the advertisement of the real estate agent. That's not where good real estate agents put their money. They put their money in advertising the home. So we went out and we found the best real estate agents. I think we have 2,000 of them now across the country, and they will help you sell your home. This is not a real estate company. This is just kind of like a matchmaking service. You write to real estate agents at Trust.com, say where you are, we find the real estate agent for you and pair you with them, and then they take you. You want your home sold for the most amount of money, and on time you want to buy a house, make it really easy. Real estate agents at Trust.com. Jason, the Twitter trigger. Twitter trigger. It actually makes perfect sense that we're transitioning from socialism onto this. It lines up perfectly because I was just reading the Gallup poll, I think it was from 2018 recently about how from 18 to 29, the millennial, I guess millennials are in 1829, and that young people now in the country is young. They have a more positive view of socialism or capitalism, and you're like, how is that even possible? Any recollection at all of just pretty current history, that makes no sense. If you look down the age brackets, the further you go down the line, you're like, okay, wait a minute, they're the only age bracket that shares that. Everybody else, they remember the Soviet Union. They remember everything about Cuba. They have all this connection to history. But the problem is that now you have people like Kazu Cortez, Ilya Omar, other people like that that are using the fact, I think, that the younger generation doesn't have that connection anymore. So they can pretty much just rewrite history. Before I get into this other thing, I just want to say, this is the danger of this, and I saw this quote from George Orwell, and he wrote this six years before he wrote 1984. This is actually the first time he said the number two plus two equals five. But he said this in an essay called Looking Back on the Spanish War, said, Nazi theory indeed specifically denies such a thing as the truth exists. The implied objective of this line of thought is a nightmare world in which the leader or some ruling click controls not only the future but the past. If the leader says of such and such events, it never happened, well, it never happened. If he says that two and two are five, well, two and two are five, the prospect frightens me much more than bombs. Indeed. That's where we are. The post fact era. This was something that was praised by Breitbart. Did he say the Nazi? Yeah, he was looking at the Nazi fascist regime when he was looking at how they were basically rewriting their own history. That's unbelievable. In the Nazi regime, there is no truth. So I was thinking along these lines, actually, I was reading through Twitter, of course, last night. And I saw Alexander Ocasio-Cortez. She was in her own Twitter fight and she was defending her gal pal, Iliyan Omar. I got the first tweet up here. I think there's a three of them. But she says, I remember a time when it was unacceptable to question the Iraq war. It was all of Congress was wrong, including Bochiopi and the Democratic Party and led my generation to disaster plus wrong war. Okay, I skipped it to the next one. Except for Barbara Lee. She changed that. She didn't mean Iraq war. She, what she meant was the Afghanistan war. She is a walking fall off. And then the next one flop on her face. They're telling you they only have two. Okay, so there's one after that where she says, which is almost worse, where she goes, but we shouldn't have gotten into either war, regardless, both Iraq and Afghanistan. Now, you can make the case to intelligently say that the continuing war in Afghanistan. Oh yeah, that's so, but honestly, we shouldn't have been in either. You can make the case to intelligently say, okay, the continuing use of American troops in Afghanistan, I'll have that conversation with you. But the response to 9-11, if you were saying that we should never have responded to that, I take ridiculous amount of offense to that because it's very personal to me. I was actually out on an exercise at the time with the Marine Corps and our unit was the first conventional unit to land. AOC saying she's in the same generation as you. So that's amazing. She was 12 at the time. She was 12 years old, so I don't hold it against her that she's just ignorant over it. Because a lot of people are nowadays, but now she's claiming to know something and making statements like that, in effect rewriting history, saying there was no real reason for us to be there. I really regret the fact that I missed everything going on here in the country. I've never seen the country united, I think, ever in my life. We've always been divided. You were fighting overseas. I was over there. Yeah, it was a completely different feeling. Everybody was laser focused on what we were doing at the time. Amazing. It was, I know it was amazing here. I heard about the stories, but over there it was like, it really was, we wanted justice, we wanted revenge. We wanted to ensure over everything else that this would never happen again. And the intelligence coming in, I wish Ocasio-Cortez, if you're watching this, give me a call. I'll tell you about some of the stuff that we're looking at. Is that a cat call? Is that what that was? That was a cat call. All right, we got to take a break and reevaluate. I'll let you get back into it. Oh, unbelievable. Wow. But sexism is not on the phone. Stop hitting on her. She's basically a side show bob walking around and hitting another rake that caught her in the face. All right, for those of you who want to listen to the rest of Jason's rant. Oh, come on, get a solid better moment to go. So, over time, it is. It's important. Just got to show up for that. Well, I will. If you haven't, are you?

Go and call Sarah out here for a moment if we say overtime here. We have a conversation off the air, and this happens all the time. I will say something about some food that people would actually want to eat or drink. This people would have to drink. And every time Sarah shuts you down, it's not kale. You shouldn't eat that or whatever that she does. The only time you ever see her eyes light up is when I mention alcohol. And whenever I say I'm going to put vodka and something, then all of a sudden, because there's no negative proven effects of health when it comes to alcohol that she's totally fine with. But oh, God, you have a grain of sugar or a piece of salt. On a potato. Maybe consider that I eat healthy to cancel out all the alcohol. Jason, I want to let you finish up your Ocasio-Cortez rewriting history. Everyone believes it. Yeah, well, see, what's dangerous? I tweeted some things about that. And a lot of people kind of said, well, we don't really know what US forces did in Afghanistan at the time. And that's very troubling to me because a lot of people were saying that. We don't really know either what was going on. And I don't know if it's just a lack of reporting or that can't be the case because it was just all over the place. Were they younger people who were saying that? That's a good question. I'm not too sure what their ages were. But it was a while ago. So it's like it's like- And remember younger people are not being taught history anymore. No, I mean- It's not a requirement. And again, that's the danger. You can make statements like this on social media. Instantly everyone believes it. And slowly but surely you start rewriting history and changing things. The intelligence that- I actually wrote an article about this on the Blaze, where I kind of go through all of this. But just really quick, a lot of the intelligence that we were receiving right now, it's all declassified. Some of the stuff I'll talk about now. But it was crazy. Like, I had never been focused on that area before, so I didn't know any of this stuff. But instantly after September 11th, we all had to become experts. You know, on Osama bin Laden, al-Qaeda, in this region as a whole. The things that we found out were frightening. It was crazy. The Taliban was harboring al-Qaeda. Everyone knew this. But al-Qaeda and the Taliban were both getting arms from Iran. That was never known. To me at least, I don't think that was known in public circles. So they're getting the arms from them. They were also supplementing their already vast cash resources with opium trade. The illicit opium market was huge. And that was actually one of the first targets that we took out, was to smash that network. That was our largest base in Afghanistan, was a former opium processing and trafficking hub. Had a huge runway airport, its own air story. Yeah, it was crazy. If ground troops wouldn't have been there just to do that, that would have continued on. Ground troops were the only way to respond there. That was the only way to break that up. Iran was also, we found out, which came out in Treasury Department documents later, and made it public, was that Iran was also providing a traffic way, a place for al-Qaeda operatives to go through, actually get official documentation so they could get to the west. This was a very, very in-depth and highly organized way to get very, very violent and dangerous jihadists into the United States, to do more follow-on attacks like 9-11. That was the only way to respond there, the absolute only way. But a lot of this information is just not known. And when I hear things like that, it's just very heartbreaking on one end because we did lose a lot of lives, a lot of us lost a lot of friends over there, to ensure, we kept saying never again, to ensure this would happen, this never again would happen to us. And we feel that that was our poor harbor. That was our day of infamy for this generation. And slowly but surely it's starting to become inconsequential to some people apparently. Yeah, well, I mean, you're talking about rewriting history. I mean, that's what the Washington Post, that's what they did in that five-miss of socialism. Yeah, that's socialism. Exactly the same. You just write a sentence and it's like, well, I wrote the sentence, so it's true. Yeah, no, I mean, that is kind of where we are now. Go see your two plus two equals five thing that you read earlier. I mean, I did the, my string of valor isn't quite as long as Jason's. It's very impressive. I went to the 9-11 museum last year. But I mean, you go through that and you just, like, it brings you back to that moment. There's one particular place that you walk through that one section of it is all of the TV's broadcasting the moments they were discovering it over and over again. So it's like Matt Lauer, who now is not allowed on TV. It was sitting there and like, he forget, like, he heard something in his ear about some plane crash. He's like, we're gonna get some details on this and come back. They actually went to commercial. And then they came back after the commercial to tell you, by the way, a plane to slam into the World Trade Center. And they have all those broadcasts and it brings you back to that moment. And then they have these, you know, those little, even walk through like a museum, they have those cones that are kind of like hanging from the ceiling and they're like audio cones. And you don't really hear anything inside of them until you walk right under them. So they have those kind of spread out in this one area. And as you walk under each one, you don't even necessarily know they're there at first, and until you look up and notice them. As you walk through each one, you walk through another voicemail message from someone who is on the plane calling their relative and you hear it over and over and over again. It brings you back to, like, really what that meant. It wasn't just this silly little talking point that Alexandria Cosio Cortez thinks it really was. Our nation really was on the brink. And, you know, the fact that people like Jason, thank God and not people like me, were over there fighting and making sure that that didn't happen again. Really, I mean, it is something that will be forgotten because it's a constant effort to make sure it is. I mean, it was... Until it happens again. Until it happens again. And then everyone will act all like they care again. And, you know, the barberlies of the world. She pointed out, there's the only one who voted against the Iraq war. Excuse me, the Afghanistan war. Make the same mistake because of Cortez. She's contagious apparently. She can't use you. But yeah, I mean, like, you... That was... She was the only one. I mean, think about all the crazy nut job Democrats in exist, and all of them voted for that. That's how overwhelmingly sure we were. And yes, there was an element of panic, and there was an element of, you know, I remember thinking, like, this could happen 10 times a day, you know, for the ongoing future, whether it's a car or it's a, you know, a massacre or it's, you know, only a few days after that, it was anthrax. I mean, if we felt really vulnerable, I remember thinking, like, we're never going to get to a point where, like, this isn't the norm again. And now, of course, we do have our situations, but, you know, largely we pushed a lot, especially that network in particular, back quite a bit. I mean, the progress has been really impressive when you stop and think about it. Though we've had our bumps and bruises over that time, you know, people like Alexandria Casio Cortez, she sees that as a way to, you know, win a Twitter battle. And that's really sad. It's undisputed. I mean, in the same vein that our response to Japan, after Pearl Harbor was undisputed, we had to respond. This is the exact same thing. You can't, like, one person voted against that. Everybody else was full on favor, including the entire nation. There was a national mandate, clear national mandate, to respond to this, not only to respond, but also to ensure that this doesn't happen again. It's just, it's not, it's not, there's no question. But if you want to have a debate on what we're still doing there, completely different, different set of circumstances, I'll have that debate. And there's, I think there's a lot of people that need to talk about that. There should be debate on that. But there is no debate on the other. Yeah. I, I, I usually tweet it every year when I remember, but it's like September 20, you know, September, I mean, maybe September 21st or something. And a poll came out and had George W. Bush with an 84% approval rating, I believe, among Democrats. Wow. I mean, think of that George Bush and 84% approval among Democrats. That's how serious that was. And look, again, this is why you don't put people like Acasio-Cortez in Congress, because she has no idea what she's talking about in every conversation she's involved in. So of course she doesn't understand this, you know, but it is frustrating, because, you know, the media is obsessed with her and, you know, it's a person that has a degree in foreign policy. You would think that would, this, this, the Afghanistan war at 9-11 would come up in one of those classes, right? I would think this is just a prank on Boston University. It's got to be like a troll or something. And they really should check and make sure she actually went there, because I got to think it's a prank. Like, who's the biggest competitor? BC. BC did this. They get, like, they actually paid for education. Just go there, pass all the classes, and then actually make an absolute moron once you get out of there. I have to use this opportunity to brag on us for a second, because I get, you know, viewer feedback. And there are several people. I know we just got some feedback the other day that, you know, someone's like, we love watching the show. My 11-year-old daughter likes to watch the news now, because of, you know, the way that you guys format it. And I just, I'm really proud of, you know, what we've built here, well, what Glenn's built, but that we are able to teach history and to teach people these things, and, you know, people are letting their kids watch, and otherwise their kids aren't going to hear it. They're not going to hear it anywhere else. So I just... And I will definitely calm down my jokes now. Now you're probably so bad, don't you? That's actually why I brought it up. By the way, alcohol is wrong, kids. All right, Jason, while we're on the subject of foreign relations, Trump, today, came out and said he agrees 100% with keeping U.S. troops in Syria. Wow, okay. So so many different things to say about this. For one... Oh, here we go. For one... I am so relieved that that is the direction he's moving in. I'm so relieved because I thought it was going to be a colossal mistake to take out the small number of troops that we have there. Now, I know this is contentious. I know a lot of people won't agree with me on that, and I totally get their reservations on this. You know, I don't want to be so overstretched, and I don't want to be an interventionist. I want to bring our guys home. But in this case, a small number of troops is preventing a much larger deployment in the future. I mean, a massive deployment. So there's way too many variables to go here that you have. I ran, you have an ISIS resurgence. So there's so many different things. So I'm glad he's going in that direction. But this makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. So the president basically just kind of came out in a tweet and said that he was pulling out all combat troops. And there was a collective freakout, rightly so. The general that was in charge of the forces in the Middle East just testified to the Senate and said that, hey, it's true, he never consulted me. We literally woke up, checked Twitter, and we've got our orders basically from Twitter. That's not... Why do I wait to be Twitter? That's basically what he said. Right. So very, very weird. This was such a big deal that like a guy that I admire more than anyone else in the military who's on the level of General Patton, General MacArthur, General Mattis, the current General Mattis, he resigned over this. And this was just too much for him. He was like, forget it. I don't agree with this. I'm out of here. We lost one of the greatest generals of our generation, of our entire nation, really. I'm putting in that high. We lost him out of the administration because of this. And now it was all for nothing. It was all for nothing. Are you kidding me? Well, this is the general Mattis did not listen to rule number one from Stu of the Trump presidency, which is never listened to something Trump says. That is the easy... Yeah, exactly. He took it literally. That was the issue. Never listen to his words. And it's bizarre. A lot of people take that as an insult. But honestly, I think you can look at it as not even an insult because I mean, he himself says, this is a negotiation. Like, I'm going to put tariffs a billion percent on it and then he doesn't. Or I'm going to take them off and then he doesn't. That's because the things he says don't have value. Even if you want to take it the best possible way, he's just a negotiator. And he says things like this. Maybe he's saying that to scare Syria. Maybe he's saying that to get people out from the caves. Who knows what his thought process is. But if you listen to something that he says and you react to something that he says, not does, something he says, you always get burned because nothing he says means anything. He's always positioning himself for something down the road. And it says this the same thing with like, oh, I didn't have a... I didn't have a... I had no business in Russia. And I'm like, all these things that he said and later on turn out to be lies and people get all fired up about it. And it's like, well, it's your fault for listening to him the first time. You should have never taken him seriously when he said that. And if he was like, well, I mean, you would never give that, that deference to any other president. You're right. You never have... I don't know how else to... I legitimately don't know how else to even follow the news. If I was going to sit here and react to everything this guy said, I would go completely insane as you're seeing everyone on CNN do. I want to live a life. I want to have an enjoyable existence. And the only way to do that, if you care about this country and the presidency and the news in general, is just not to listen to him. Wait until he passes a policy. When he passes it or he's about to pass it, you could start talking about it. But when he says it, there is no value in it. It is not... He doesn't say things because they're real. He says things for some other reason, whether he thinks it's funny to screw with the media, whether he thinks he wants to see what the reaction is, whether he doesn't understand the issue and later someone will explain it to him, whether he's negotiating, whatever it is, when he just blirts something out, you can react to it all you want and you can get your day of coverage like CNN does. But in reality, it never means anything. Words have consequences. They did. But it did with Mattis, right? Yeah, for this, I remember the collective panic of the SDF forces, the Kurdish forces that we were fighting alongside, they were like, pretty much combat operations ground to a halt. They're like, whoa, what do we do here? They didn't know what was going... There were serious real-world implications for this, losing an icon, and then messing with the war against ISIS. But that was all off of probably a 5am toilet tweet. That's insane. All right, I want to let's lighten it up before we end the show, if we could. And by the way, whoever has your 11-year-old watching, you may want to have them leave the room or just view this first. We're about to just say go to MoMo. No, I said lights. I may have heard you and Mr. Glenn back on radio today talking about a ex-transgender who now identifies as an agender alien. And he has... Do I say he? It's the... It, it, it... It requested it would be called it. He's assuming aliens are genderless? He's one of them, what do you mean? I mean, it's one of them. Well, it wouldn't... I mean, it is assuming aliens don't have genders. No, it is an alien and it knows about its own kind that it does not have gender. Okay, but... That's true. So he's removed his nipples? Obviously. Because that's what you do. In his eyebrows? How does he know that aliens don't have nipples? He's an alien. It's an alien. Of course it knows. So own people. People? That's an alien. It's always... Yeah, well, whatever. It's own kind. It's a big world that we live in. I mean, I don't know if this is a bit for this person or this alien. I don't know if it's... But I mean, I will say this. If you are a leftist and you are willing to take Caitlyn Jenner at the word that that's a girl, and every single person you have to understand, remember what Ellen's definition, I always find this to be the most informative. Ellen, when she was talking about this on her show, said, what you don't understand is gender is just like, it's a feeling that you have in your brain. That was how she described it. And I thought that was honestly really informative. Like, well, we're just talking about different stuff then. Because I'm not talking about the feeling in your brain. Like that... You can have any feeling you want in your brain. I'm talking about like, what parts you have. Are we using... Maybe we just don't have the same language. To me, gender means kind of like what parts you have. And to you, it means a feeling in your brain. Well, we're just talking about two... Let's come up with two different words. Because we're just talking about different things. But if you were going to respect that, like Ellen kind of says, as you're feeling your brain, this person has a feeling in their brain that they are an alien. How can you not recognize it? How can you cannot go and say, yeah, you are an alien. Thank you. Yes, your name is Nebula or whatever the heck the thing is. From the planet Zarkhan. How can you not do that? In all honesty, just because you don't think what aliens are real, or that has nothing to do with you, it's what they feel in their brain. And if that's what he feels in their brain, that's how you should address them. And I guess rework society around that. I just want to know these people who have all of these surgeries. Like he had... Right? You have to have a surgery to get your nipples removed. How do you scissors for that? Oh my god. And eyebrows removed. Like all of these people have all these surgeries. You have the person who wants to be a cat. And like they've had all of those surgeries. Right, yeah, see that. Like what do they do for a living that they have all of this money laying around? That's like, I'm going to go to the doctor and go to the plastic surgeon and get my nipples removed. It's fair. What are they doing that I don't know about that they're making all of this extra money? I know Jason, you were planning for one of these surgeries. How much does it cost? No, I don't know. That's a good question. Probably taxpayers are paying for it. Probably there's some law that we have to pay for everyone's alien or cat surgery. It's stuffed into some bill from Alexandria, Kazuia, Porteis. If aliens though, if this is a sign that there is like an alien species, we're going to be invaded. There's a Galagaph machine out there. We should start training. We shared. I'm very good. It's very good. Very good. Me and Jason are number one and number two in the entire office. You've got to work with such nerds. Yesterday's poll, do you believe the mainstream media narrative that Republicans are more likely to be racist than Democrats? 98%. 93%. We'll get 93 on that one. You. Will you allow me to criticize them? Go ahead. 93% said no. 3% said slightly. 4% said definitely. Who are you? Who are you? Reveal yourselves to be. It's Twitter. First of all, people are trolls. And second of all, there's always going to be someone left that are following, right? So they're going to all vote the other way. You're never going to be happy. Do you understand that? You're never going to be happy. Well, 4% of you are stupid. Okay, there you go. That's true. Today's poll. Do you believe a gender wage gap exists? We've got to talk to people who are making these polls because it's making me like viscerally. This is why I'm actually writing them every day because we want to see who got angry. Let us know at the places Twitter that is at the place. These guys have to go train. They have to go train with Galaga for the alien takeover. So we'll see you guys tomorrow. It's on. You got to hit the release back. I was assuming we were going to be attacking the aliens when they're just identifying. Are you some sort of... That's a hate problem. It's what's usually up for them.
