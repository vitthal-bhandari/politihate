    "text": " Today, rumor has it that Donald Trump will be arrested tomorrow. We've got the latest on that. Xi Jinping meets with Putin to broker a peace deal. What could possibly go wrong? And Joe Biden issues his first veto on anti-ESG legislation. We've got all of that and more coming up and it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Saragansales and over the weekend, former President Donald Trump ignited a firestorm when he announced on Truth Social that an indictment against him was imminent and that Soros-backed Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg plans to arrest him tomorrow for the horrible, awful, devastating crime of falsifying business records. Trump said on Truth Social, now illegal leaks from a corrupt and highly political Manhattan district attorney's office, which has allowed new records to be set in violent crime and whose leader is funded by George Soros, indicate that with no crime being able to be proven and based on an old and fully debunked by numerous other prosecutors' fairytale, the far and away leading Republican candidates and former President of the United States of America will be arrested on Tuesday of next week. Protest, take our nation back. Now, I want to explain something here. The possible indictment stems from the 2015 allegations made by porn star Stormy Daniels that Trump's then lawyer, convicted liar Michael Cohen, paid her $130,000 in hush money to stop her from telling the press about their previous affair. And the issue at hand is not the existence of an NDA, which is obviously completely legal, but how Trump's company reimbursed Cohen? The payment was listed as a legal expense and the company cited a retainer agreement with Cohen that didn't exist. Oh, the big smoking gun. Now, because of this, the DA's office argues that the reimbursement wasn't technically related to any legal services from Cohen, resulting in a misdemeanor criminal charge of falsifying business records. Now, prosecutors on top of that intend to try to elevate the misdemeanor to a felony by arguing Trump's intent to defraud, included an intent to commit or conceal a second crime, which they say is the hush payment itself because it served as an improper donation to the Trump campaign. They say the payment's purpose was to benefit his presidential run. So let me get this straight. A DA who has made it a point to decriminalize decriminalize major crimes in Manhattan, a man who has downgraded 52% of felony charges in his city to a misdemeanor, a guy who has no problem releasing violent criminals into the streets so they can re-offend suddenly takes the crime of falsifying business records very seriously. Clearly, just to make it clear, again, please listen to me, these are all allegations and the DA's office has not confirmed the rumors to be true. But every single person who calls themselves a conservative, a Republican, or hell, even just an American should overtly and unequivocally speak out against this and say if this is true, it cannot stand. If this is true, we have no real rule of law anymore, no justice system. We are talking about a president of the United States who has had virtually every department of the federal government weaponized against him. They abused the system in spite of his campaign, then they called him crazy for accusing them of doing it. They used their offices to promote the Russian collusion hoax that they told you for two years was true, even though they knew it wasn't. When that didn't work, they abused the system again and impeached him over complete **** twice. Then they rigged the voting system so he wouldn't win again. They weaponized the FBI against him and raided his home for some files. And now, if they intend to arrest him, perp walk him, take his mugshot, fingerprint him, book him, a former president of the United States, over a misdemeanor charge of falsifying business records that federal prosecutors already looked at for campaign finance violation and didn't pursue. Our republic, dead, gone, buried. The left has two standards, one that they enjoy, free of accountability, consequences, rules, if you're a violent criminal, you too can enjoy a life free of accountability as long as you vote the right way. You know, and Donald Trump announced his latest presidential run. He said this, they're not coming after me, they're coming after you. I'm just standing in their way, and I always will stand in their way. And he's right. If they're brazen enough to do this to a former president running for office right now, as much as they claim to care about interference in elections and all, they will do it to every single one of you. The time to speak up and end this is now here to discuss this and more. Our Chad Prather host of the Chad Prather show, which you can find here on Blaze TV, along with Alex Stein, host of prime time with Alex Stein, which you can all also find on Blaze TV. I highly recommend you subscribe to both of their YouTube channels, by the way, exact same time. The exact same time. Yeah, it is a little odd, but hey, listen, competition brings out the best in everybody, right? Well, not one of you. Yeah, well, two of us were fighting like pit bulls over. I know. I feel kind of tense now. Well, competing. Yeah, I'm not competing either, but So, so I want, okay, I want to get your thoughts on this guys. And then, and then I want to get into kind of the who has responded, who hasn't, who's speaking out against this, who hasn't, because I know Jim Jordan and the House Judiciary Committee is going at this full force, which they should, this is clearly an abuse of, you know, prosecutorial power, but it's like, it sounds so off the wall. How could this possibly be? There's no way that this is true. But look at all of the other ridiculous nonsense that they have put this man through, and it's like, actually, I wouldn't be surprised. Well, if it's not, this will be something else. Great monologue, by the way. That was excellent. I appreciate that. Excellent commentary. And I think a great summary of this whole thing. People need to play it on repeat. They need to play it for all their friends. They need to put it on the loudspeakers at the house during dinner time. Seriously, it's telling because you make a lot of common sense arguments in there that in a real world where we used to embrace reality and not mental illness, it used to be something where we said, oh yeah, this is dumb. I mean, this is dumb. It's stupid. You know, Marie Clinton did the same thing. She paid for the Steele dossier. The DNC paid for the Steele dossier. They also listed it as a legal expense. It was a misdemeanor. They paid a fine and they moved on from the thing. But that's not going to happen with Trump. That's why I say if there's not this, it will be something else. That's the bottom line. So this is the clown world we're living in. It's just going to keep being one big old circle, keep going around if it's not this, it'll be the next thing until they get that mugshot. And so that's what I, because I recall, when we were sitting on this program, and I'm sure on your show as well, we sat here and talked about, they want that perp walk. They want the perp walk. But we were not talking about that with this. We were talking about it with the, when they raided his home. I think classified documents. Yes. That's how, that's how badly they want it. They're searching, they're going for every single possible way that they can get that perp walk, which Chad, as you said, well, I mean, you have to get it. And rhetorical questions here has, has Joe Biden, everything Joe Biden's ever done has been illegal, right? Yeah. I mean, I'm sure everything he's everything. He's a rock Obama's ever done has been illegal, everything that, I mean, list the presence. Right. Every single one of them has done something, check the wrong box, file the wrong thing, done something illegal. I mean, we do things. We do things and they're not filed correctly, or it is, but to elevate this from misdemeanor to felony, we're now you're operating with a two tier justice system where certain people get off and a slap on the wrist and violent criminals are being turnal use to walk the streets in New York and to continue to practice what they, their crimes by this DA, this is, we're all in trouble. I tweeted it over the weekend and you, you effectively said it, Trump said it as well, that if they arrest Trump or if they indict Trump, they are symbolically arresting slash indicting every single one of us. Now they've already labeled you, you're on the list. In fact, if you're not already on three government watch list, you haven't done your job. So you're already on the list, you're already labeled. So they're coming for you. And if they can redefine the law, there is no defense. That's why, and again, Glenn brought it out, Glenn Beck brought it out so eloquently this morning on his show, hammered it. And with real true conviction, it wasn't just glenisms. It's time to start calling your representatives. I mean, hound them. And say this type of thing, because if not, this is the next step to Gulag. Right. And that's the point that I want to make to, I want everyone to take away from this, is like, this isn't just some like, oh, yeah, it's a sideshow, it's a circus, but it is so much bigger than that. No, it is. No, this is really the 30,000 foot view that we have to have, because a lot of people are trying to make it about party politics, but really it's much deeper than that. It's the destabilization of America, because now if they love their country, listen, Hillary Clinton, she belongs in jail and the dad about it. I'm sure, like you said, Joe Biden has done illegal business dealings through his son in China, but I don't even necessarily know if he deserves a per walk. I don't know. I think when you become president, I'm serious. I know that sounds weird. And I'm not saying that I don't want people to pay for the crimes that they commit, but when you become a president, you get a little special treatment. I mean, this is the basic thing when you win the president's argument, Alex. My point being is this. My point being is this. We're talking about a two-tier justice system and how it's bad. I know, I know, but this is my point is, but I get it. I get it, but this is why it's bad, because it's not making just one party look bad. They think it's making magma look bad. It makes our country look bad. Like we have a banana republic. So globally, optically, we look like a freaking banana republic, and they want to do that on purpose. They want us to make us look like we're weak, so that we have to join the New World Order, or NATO, or whatever big one-world government they want to push us to. Here's the thing, to your point, while they may indict a former president, again, I don't see Donald Trump doing hard time in federal penitentiary. You and I would, though. Somebody that takes a nuclear file off of a submarine or something like that who is a sailor or a serviceman, they put them in prison. Hillary Clinton cuts the top of a classified document off, sends it over an un- Earns an email server. Email server, and it's slapped on the wrist. There's no accountability for something like that. But life's not fair. That's my point. That's what sucks. And I know that people that are watching this, us conservatives, we cannot be a victim either. That's what they want us to do is now they want us all to be a victim, because they're taking out Trump. Well, but life is not fair. You're right. And it's something that I teach my children all the time. Whenever my older son complains, I'm like, well, yeah, but you know what, life's not fair. So deal with it. But this is such a bigger level than that. Yes. Because it's like, it's not just, oh, well, you know, a president should, I mean, as you say, I disagree with you, by the way, I don't share your thought that the president should. You should be able to do a little bit. You can drive drunk. You can do a couple of stuff. I don't care. If you, if you, George Strait gets a little. I think we're talking about, I think there's a very important distinction to make. I want to let you, I want to let you, this is my show. You're talking about it. I know, but this is why I'm sorry, because this is why I heard an argument there saying if he did get a DWI, should he go to jail for DWI? The president? Yes. He doesn't drive himself. But yeah. I feel like the president maybe could get a break on a DWI. Listen, listen, what I'm saying is like there needs to be one standard and it needs to be called for everyone. So if violent criminals who are committing felons are being released out into the streets of New York, then Donald Trump doesn't need to go get a perp walk for a freaking misdemeanor of falsifying business records because they couldn't get them on a campaign finance violation. Like that, like that, that's absurd to me that anyone should have to do that. But when you know the system's corrupt, send a surprise. Well, no, of course it's not a surprise. But I mean, that doesn't make it, it's not like, oh, well, too bad. Oh, well, it's not a surprise. So let's just deal with it. I mean, like, we have to change that. Our country is not built on fairness. Our country is built on justice. Justice. And so when you start, we can make the comments say life's not fair. And you're absolutely right about that. It's not fair. You know, we've been in this huge equality versus equity debate, right? And that's about an issue of fairness. But justice is a whole other deal. Justice has got to be blind. There's nobody above the law. There's nobody that transcends the law. Government that's sitting in power today and I heavily use that word power, which is unfortunate because they're no longer representative form of government to any of us. What they're doing is they're usurping the law and they are they are trampling on the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and they are putting themselves above it. This is tyranny. So that's if you don't apply justice, you wind up with tyranny because that's why I made the joke there that kind of passed. I said, George Strait can get away with it. What George Strait is the king, right? The king can get away with things. President can't. He can't. That's why there's rules on who can be president and who's qualified for being president. So if those rules apply to them, then breaking the rules applies to them as well. But there's exceptions to the rules. The same reason why I can't shoot you in Texas, but if I go to Afghanistan as a military person, I can murder people legally. I'm just saying to rules are the Afghan law, you know, as I agree. I agree. I just for me, the corruption is so deep. Now I hope it wakes people up and I don't think Donald Trump should be arrested, but I'm just not surprised that they're going to do this to try to destabilize and make our country look. It's just not this. So do something else. Yeah. Just keep doing it. So let's go ahead and let's take a quick break and then I want to get to I want to get to some of the reactions from some of our leaders, lawmakers, but let's go ahead and first think our sponsor, Pure Health. So guys, well, Alex doesn't. Alex is all straight laced and stuff. I take this every day of my life. Well, and you should. I should. Chad drinks tequila and he wants to. I also do that every day of my life.

So going back to what's going on with Trump and the possible indictment and arrest, I want to I want to cover here what the reaction has been. So the House Judiciary Committee is demanding that Alvin Bragg testify before Congress. Jim Jordan says in, you know, this is unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial authority and that they want to know if he has worked with the DOJ, if he has received information with the DOJ and you know, just trying to get to the bottom of that. So kudos to the House Judiciary Committee. I also want to play. Let's play Rhonda Santos, who by the way, I don't fault at all for not speaking on this prior to being asked about in a press conference because again, the man has not said that he is running for president. We don't know if he's running for president. We all possibly have our suspicions that he's running for president, but he hasn't announced. And so I didn't think that he had an obligation to just say something as governor of Florida, just just to say it right proactively. But he was asked about it in a press conference, and I want to play some of his response watch. We are not involved in this won't be involved in this. I have no interest in getting involved in some type of manufactured circus by some Soros DA. Okay, he's trying to do a political spectacle. He's trying to virtue signal for his base. I've got real issues I got to deal with here in the state of Florida. We're obviously shutting down CBDC, which is important. We've got so many things pending in front of the legislature. I've got to spend my time on issues that actually matter to people. I can't spend my time worrying about things of that nature. So so we're not going to be involved in it in any way. I'm fighting for Floridians and I'm fighting back against Biden. That's what I do every single day. I have a problem with this answer. I have a big problem with this answer and I love I love DeSantis for what he's doing in Florida. But to say this isn't an issue, I'm actually I'm focusing on real issues as if this isn't an issue. I think he had an opportunity if he does in fact want to run for president. I think he had a real opportunity to come out and be a leader regardless of all of the personal attacks that he has received from Trump. I think that if you have the opportunity to unite on something on a principle on a very important principle, by the way, and say, you know what? Regardless of I think he's got some personal problems with me, but I have to say this cannot stand. I you know, I join all of my Republican cohorts in calling for them to stop doing. I think the House Judiciary Committee should investigate. I mean, there are so many things he could have said that would be based on principle rather than the man. And I was really disappointed he didn't go there. It's a strong departure from where he has really is placed himself in other situations. I mean, Ron DeSantis is eloquent. He's he's forceful. He's direct. It doesn't meant words. I appreciate both his stance and his policies as well as his rhetoric over the past couple of years. This was a far cry from being adequate as a response to this. This was a politicized jab in some ways. And there are going to be people who are going to say, well, what can he do? Well, first of all, that is a Floridian. Donald Trump is a resident of Florida. What can he do? Well, you know, look, at some point in time, Donald Trump, he's running for president. He's got a step foot in New York at some point in time. Anyway, he'll have to face it. But at least symbolically, he needs to stand up and there needs to be a show of force and solidarity there amongst the GOP. And he also needs to remember they're going to come after him too. Right. Exactly. They're going to come after this. As I said in the last segment, they're going to come after everybody. So Ron DeSantis is next on the list. I don't I don't care how many people out there listening to this say, well, a huge establishment, they'll never come out because I've heard the arguments. But I promise you, they don't care if you're establishment. I mean, listen, you got I'm going to stop right there. All the rhinos, I was just going to make a very distinct point about the rhinos, whether it's the Mitch McConnell's or the Lindsey Grahams and all these they're going to come after them too. Because it's just a matter of time the dominoes will fall. Eventually, it will fall on you. Yeah, they will they will use them up until the point where they are no longer usable. And then they will discard these people. Well, I'm looking at like political theater and I just don't understand why Ron wouldn't try to gain all that political collateral with Trump supporters by standing up for him because I feel like that would help him out. If he stood up for him now, he'd be like, Hey, when Trump's yelling at you calling you meatball Ron, you could say, Hey, well, I had character I stood up for this guy. So I'm surprised. You want to show leadership? Now's the time exactly when somebody poo poo's on you. You say, thank you. What is what did Michael Obama say when they go low, we go high? My point being it's not about that. What this is about is it's political theater. And I think Ron is seeing the and I hate to say this because there's a lot of people that are in this school of thought that this happening to Trump might help Trump. But I think in reality him doing the perp walk, all of the massive amount of media publicity, this is going to bring the negative publicity to bring. This is only going to hurt him and help Ron. So I think that he's just trying to benefit from it. I guess, but I mean, I don't know any other reason for him to give that response. I don't mean it. And it's very upsetting to me because I just now is the time for you to show if that is your political aspiration, now's the time to show that you are going to be a real leader and put principles above some sort of petty disagreement that you have with someone. And he chose not to do that. I'm just very disappointed. And if one for Trump, Andrew Gillom could be the governor and he was on crack. He was on pills. So I mean, Ron does. Oh, Trump, a little bit of help. So, okay. Oh, and by the way, the new NYPD is already getting ready for all of the, you know, I don't know what's going on. If they're getting ready for protests, they're getting ready to block. But I don't know, but they're setting up a bunch of barriers outside of the Manhattan courthouse. Guys, don't go. We'll do it. Don't test. There will be more feds there than actual protesters. And you're going to the way up says it around the corner waiting for you. Okay, don't do it. Don't fall into their trap. Please for the love of God, don't do it. All right, I want to get to. Don't don't do what Trump said do. Right. He said, go protest. Right. Do not. Don't do it. Do not do this. This is a very bad idea. Listen, there will be a time and a place for that. But like, if you don't see that as us falling right back into their hands again, so that they can go see, we told you guys, they were a bunch of uncivilized savages. Far right extremists. I'm telling you, well, there will be Jackasses who do it. And they're dumb. That's this program. You're not dumb. You're smart. So don't do it. I said it. She didn't. Don't do it. All right. So really quickly here. So Xi Jinping arrived in Moscow today to meet with President Vladimir Putin on, you know, they say that this is a mission of peace. So I'm going to be all stuffed with fluffies winning the thing. So I look, when you have Xi Jinping, the Chinese regime who has, you know, Uighurs in re-education camps and is committing all these sorts of human rights abuses. And you partner him up with Vladimir Putin. And they are apparently the adults in the room who are going to try to broker a peace deal. It makes me a little nervous. Should. It should. Listen, they solidified their relationship about 15 years ago. Xi Jinping and Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. So it's nothing new, but this is a definite, I mean, they're probably sitting around the room putting up Joe Biden memes, right? Just like getting a chuckle out of the whole thing. And this is a big middle finger on the world stage to the American regime. And I don't use that word accidentally or lightly. So we'll see what happens out of this. I'm just glad that, you know, Kate, I'm going to go Alex Stein on you for a minute. I'm just glad that we have a capable leader. Who are going to protect us. And it's okay. I mean, he's he studies Persian culture. I don't know if you saw that clip. No, oh my God. He's Persian now. Yeah. He's everything. Oh my gosh. Now, I mean, it's very scary. And we talk about this all the time. And she like a broken record of the military industrial complex. I mean, it looks like World War three. We want to be in it just as bad as Russia and China. So that's what I think is really scary. Well, it doesn't sound like we're I mean, Xi Jinping's calling for a ceasefire. Yeah, I don't even think they want to be in it. It's it's it's the West who wants it. Well, it's because all we manufacture are bombs and guns in America. We don't manufacture anything. Literally the iPhone, computers, most of the stuff that America manufacturers, we outsource. So we always benefit the more Tomahawk missiles or more military spy planes. We benefit financially from any war. Yeah. All right. Let's go ahead and take a quick break. And when we come back, I want to talk about Joe Biden's first veto as president.

Did you guys see that chick that tried to trash talk me on Twitter about showing my fat picture? Real quick. Oh, you missed this? Oh, and I follow you like a fox or like a hawk, whatever, what happened? Yeah. Well, she posted a fat picture of mine. Trying to shame you? Yeah. I'm like, thanks for showing everyone like how hard I worked. And I look really good now. So I didn't see it. But CJ told me about it. My girlfriend told me about it. And she goes, she's had never seen that picture of you. She goes, she goes, so cute. Because it doesn't look like her. And I said, we've always said that. But that's a picture like Sarah for years put out there. Yeah, yeah, like, right. I'm like, you didn't like go stalking through my private documents to get that picture. I posted it to show like this is the transformation that you two can have if you take control of your health. Yeah. But if you're a fitness influencer or you're like fitness, you're a Nazi, according to the left. So I guess I don't know. I'm really proud of it. Like I was like, thank you for showing me how much better I look. And your husband's helped you transition further away from the Texas Longhorns, which that's a positive. Well, they have Archie Manning. Archie Manning, they're gonna be good, I think. And it connects a few years. I hope they're in the SEC, boys. So, all right, I guess. Walk out of the nose on that day. So Joe Biden vetoed his first bill today. This is the ESG bill. What a putt. Yeah. So it's this bill specifically ended enforcement of a new Biden regime labor department rule urging private retirement plan fiduciaries to consider ESG in their, they're saying that you could not consider ESG in the investment decision. This, again, like it passed. It passed through the House. It passed through the Senate. So bipartisan, right? It passed both chambers, went to Joe Biden's desk. And he was like, no, actually, he said that this is overly influenced by MAGA Republicans. MAGA House. I just signed this veto because legislation passed by the Congress would put at risk retirement savings of individuals across the country. They couldn't take into consideration investments that would be impacted by climate, impacted by overpaying executives. And that's why I decided to veto it and make sense to veto it. Does it? Yeah. Does it? Does it? Yeah, forget fiduciary responsibilities. Forget making sure that you people who handle your retirement money actually make sure that your retirement money is going to be there for your retirement. Right. Let's just make sure that it's a, it's something that I feel is philosophically, politically opposed or, you know, to my political party. Therefore, not going to do it. But you're right. The MAGA House, which if you watch the booklet, he talks about the MAGA in his tweet he talks about, I'm wanting to oppose this, that the MAGA House put through. Let's begin with the labels. Again, it's one big classification system of putting you on that list. That's also, it had to go through the Senate, which by the way, is not a MAGA Senate. Right. MAGA, a Senate, MAGA Senate. I'm confusing, but anyway. No, I, but again, like completely mischaracterizing as if it just has to go through one chamber and then it goes straight to Joe Biden's desk. Well, it looks like Bill Gates planned to make sure that no Americans made it to Social Security failed. So this is the only way that they can stop it, I guess, is by not allowing humans to actually have money for the retirement. And really, if you really look at this, Joe Biden, he's not the one that vetoed it. Somebody else told them to do it. So it's just very obvious that somebody said, Hey, Vida, this, he's not calling the shots. Yeah, I didn't pop in and talk about the climate, whatever. Yeah, he wasn't even sure that he was alive in that clip, to be honest. I love the whispers. Always the whispers. Okay, I want to play this clip of Anthony Fauci. So Dr. Fauci and DC Mayor Muriel Bowser. This is the best clip. I know, I know. So they were filming this upcoming, it's guess, it's a documentary on PBS. This is their American Masters series. And they, this is from June 2021. So I just want to be clear. This is not from today, but that doesn't make it any more awesome. So this is Dr. Fauci and Muriel Bowser going door to door to try to convince DC residents to get vaccinated. And Fauci learned very quickly that some of these residents don't play much. People in America are not settled with the information that's been given to us right now. So I'm not going to be lining up taking a shot on a vaccination for something that wasn't clear in the first place. And then you all create a shot in Muriel's time. It takes years to create vaccination. Well, it used to take years. Okay. And you used to know how many years we're invested in this, in this approach, about 20 years of science to get those to be enough. And now I'm not, it's definitely not enough. Nobody be taking no vaccination that you are. The only reason I'm talking to you right now, as close as we are, is that I've been vaccinated. But if it allowed thousands of people like you, don't get vaccinated, you're going to let this virus continue to percolate in this country and in this something like the common flu then, right? When you start talking about pan people to get vaccinated, when you start talking about incentivizing things to get people vaccinated, it's something else going on with that. Dark campaign is about fear. It's about inciting fear in people. You all attack people with fear. That's what this pandemic is. It's a fear. It's fear. It's pandemic. That's all it is. I love that they were walking away trying to get the conversation to stop. And he's like, no, I'm not done. I'm going to keep talking until I prove my point. It's so good. I know again, it's from 2021, but we love to see. She heads fumbled at the wrong dude. Yeah, she sure did. She sure did. She sure did. She sure did. She sure did. I mean, you could see somebody saying that now, especially knowing what we know, but this guy was ahead of his time. I mean, he wasn't the hero we deserved. He was the hero we needed. That was. Can you? I'm still puzzled as to how that got in the footage. Makes no sense. How did that seem to lie today? That's why I'm saying like someone there really must not, they might be there. They're not well done. There might be someone based within PBS. Actually, personally, I think this is how tone deaf they are to themselves, to their own voices there. They think that by putting that in there, this guy looks like a fool. They don't realize that he appears to be the person with common sense. You're probably right. Yeah. We're going to make these DC residents look like total morons. Yeah. And did you see the way Tony Foucher is talking to him everywhere that Tony Foucher guys, people will kiss his butt and he was shook. Like he was kind of throwing out. He's like, oh, this is 20 years from this vaccine. Like he really didn't know how to combat this guy on his porch. And that logic there is so dumb. So dumb. We've spent 20 years working on this. MRNA technology. Really? 20 years ain't enough. I love that. Listen, then you if you spend so much time on a COVID vaccine, why'd you call it Operation Warp Speed? Just a sheer fact, that's something awfully suspect to that logic they're trying to use right there. Well, also, I mean, how many of those 20 years were they just like doing on purpose, gain a function research so that they could have vaccine ready to go. He's kind of admitting. Working on this ever since I was killing people in Africa with AIDS. Yeah. And I do want to say this. I love the vaccine. I have six vaccines myself. But yeah, but if I got three polio vaccines. A lot. No, but if I had three polio vaccines and I still got polio, I would have some questions. Well, it doesn't explain a lot. Well, listen, now that you bring that up, like that, this is the COVID vaccine is not the only one that people think that they're protected and they're not. They end up getting all so good. Sarah's crazy. She's just crazy. Juiced today. The measles outbreaks that happen, which by the way, measles has never been eradicated. There are measles outbreaks every year. There are people get the measles every year. Mumps outbreaks on college campuses, even though all of the people that have been vaccinated, like this is not exclusive to COVID. And those. Yeah. So just stop trusting the experts. Herpes. Stop trusting the experts. Herpes. Herpes vaccine. Yeah. And they give it to babies now. They give it to babies. Don't you remember that was the whole thing. They wanted to mandatory do that in middle schoolers in Texas. Yes. So Gardasil. Whatever it is. They wanted to make sure that. I think the herpes. No, there was a herpes one. And there's a herpes. There's not a herpes back. What do you think the herpes comes from? It's HPV virus. Pretty sure. But I'm not a scientist anymore. Is there ever since I got fired from Pfizer? Okay, I'm going to fact check that. We're going to take a break. We'll be right back. I'm not sure it's the herpes right there. Herpes vaccine. Here's that. Box. Herpes. I'm not sure. Yesterday, New York Attorney General, Leticia James, hosted a drag queen story time hour. Yes, I said the Attorney General of New York is now hosting drag queen story time hours. And she read material from a children's book to minors. She hosted, this is at the LGBTQ plus centric, the center located in West Village along with it. Look, I don't like the drag queen thing. I don't get even as an adult. Like I don't want to go watch someone pretend to be me and then pay them my hard earned money. That's not something that appeals to me. But they've taken this so over the top. These are not drag queens. These are just like really sick people who want to dress up as clowns or something. I don't know because this person isn't even trying to look like a woman. It's just trying to look like a monster. I feel like watch. Like, and I'll always be here. I'll be near standing by and know that I'll love you till the day that I die. Whatever you dream of, I believe you can be. For you are my child, no, no, no. Range is in free. People are exuberant, huh? By the way, those of you who are listening the shirt that this, what do you even call this thing? What's the phase? What's your face painted like that? I don't, that's why it does. It does look like a character for sure. It says, I don't want to look or be cis. So people say, yeah, but clowns dress up. I don't want to go to a clown show either. They freak me out too. Well, I mean, for children, many children have fear of clowns. The adults, you scare them in clowns. I agree. Oh, and this reminds me speaking of herpes. Oh, that's different. I understand that we're given a fair a hard time. Herpes simplex virus is what causes herpes. Right. And of course, the- Thank you. I was like, am I losing my mind? Because I do not think that this is- We were going on about it. HPV is different. But I'm sure there's some herpes here. There's some crossover in this video right here. And this is another thing. They're just going to keep doing it, keep trotting it out. It's going to get weirder and weirder and weirder. Listen, when you have Rachel Levine, Rachel in quotes, Richard Levine, who is the health and human, whatever, in Biden's cabinet who's saying that genital or gender affirming care, that's his term, is going to be normalized. And parents just have to get the right rhetoric, basically, to get their brains wrapped around this thing for chemical castrations and genital mutilations. It is going to be normalized. All of this stuff, people say, well, that doesn't have anything to do with that. Okay. Okay. You keep lying to yourself, but I promise you, it's all connected. Well, especially when you're reading to children, and again, the shirt says, I don't want to look or be cis. Right. You're going to say that's not pushing a lifestyle onto children. You're going to say that that's just, oh, we're just trying to be inclusive. I don't want to look or be trans. I don't want to look or be drag. I don't want to look or be gay. All right. Now, if I say that, is that hate speech? Is that me being homophobic? Is that me being transphobic? Why the hell do you get to put that on a shirt in front of impressionable kids and tell them that, what if they want to be who they are, who they're created to be, who they're born as? And you tell them, I don't want to be that. Why would you want to be that? That's an essence, the message you're giving these kids. I got a little PTSD watching this. I swear, I reminded me. I swear, you see her face like that. She looked like a gargoyle. She looked very scary. And I'm serious. I joke around a lot, but it really brought me back to when I saw Jurassic Park. I think I was like eight years old. I swear, I remember all the going. Just listen, I saw all the dinosaurs. I remember I was all scared. And my mom was like, I tried to leave the movie theater. My mom grabbed him, made me sit down and not leave the theater. And that's the vibe I get from these parents. Now these kids want to watch that scary monster and the parents. Watching that room, you see that every single kid has a parent forcing their kid to watch that. That's the scariest part. Dr. Ian Malcolm said in Jurassic Park, first there's, there's Ewing and there's Awing and then there's running and screaming. That's the way I feel watching this. All these kids are run away screaming. Yeah. And their parents are just watching. Yeah, yeah. She's gonna watch. How do you watch that and not say, this is nothing to do with, you know, who you love or how you want to be creative or you want to call something and art it and everything to do with just mental illness? I mean, how do you watch that in your takeaway is like, oh, this is a lovely Halloween and not like, this person is definitely mentally ill and needs to look hard. So, you know, where is the reality? I've never seen a person with a green face. Where it, or orange hair like that, it doesn't, it doesn't happen. It doesn't occur naturally in creation or nature. Where is the balance? Where is the beauty? Where is the grace? There's none of that in there. So to be weird for weird sake is exactly that. It leads to a disorder which leads to a chaos. Beauty is defined by balance. You know, if your eye is up here and down here, or Nancy Pelosi's eyebrows for that matter, they're off. So you look at that and you go, that looks weird. Why? Because there's no balance. So when you look at this, it's against any form of order that leads to a peace in life. It is. And so they're creating confusion. That's what they want to do. Yeah. And I want to make this last point. They literally say cultural appropriation is racist. Like if I wear, you know, a jersey and I, you know, try to sag my pants or something. They say that cultural appropriation is racist, but woman appropriation is totally fine. You can mock women evenly. Well, what would happen if one of you dressed up in blackface? Oh man, we canceled in two seconds. Yeah. I'd curious to do it. See if anybody's actually watching my show. Like this person's appropriating the ogres. This is ogre face. That's not even woman face. I know. By the way, I do want to brag on my organization for a second because we did have another victory over the weekend. Thanks to, probably a lot of you who saw our call to action. There was a brewery here in Dallas that was going to have an all ages welcome drag show and we had everyone spring into action. You guys made the phone calls. You guys went to their Facebook. You guys reviewed them on Yelp and because of your pressure, not only did they cancel the all ages part. First, they age restricted it. Yeah. Then they said, yeah, you know what? We're just going to go ahead and cancel the whole thing. Good. Now they pretended to be victims, but I don't care about that. I really don't care. I call it a success and I want to thank all of you guys who joined us and put the pressure on them and those of you who want to join, you can go to defendkidstx.com and we're going to do it. I mean, I don't see a reason to not even there's one in Florida that I saw the other day that I just remembered. I need to go back and tweet out and I'm going to tweet out. All I'm going to tweet out is the phone number to the establishment. I feel like that's all it takes. And if really you've actually had a lot of wins, I think it's been almost about three or four months since a lot of these have been shut down in the last few months that I've seen that you've posted about. So it's not just this one. You've had a lot of wins. Yeah, I appreciate that. Ergensalas, baby. Mm-hmm. Try and work on a save that kids, damn it. Probably shouldn't have said damn it either, but I did. I don't know. Is Damon a cuss word? I think you can say that. I don't think it does. Well, they don't have to believe that. And all the kids in unison go, damn it. Yeah. Well, I would just like to say before we go to break, I would just like to say for the record, I literally always say this show is not family friendly. The news is not family friendly. I don't let my children watch this show. I don't let my children watch the news at all. So, you know, I mean, if it's up to you, but I'm just saying, I don't find this to be family friendly. We'll be right back. A new article out that was circling on social media over the weekend claimed that drinking coffee perpetuates white supremacy. I've been saying this for years. This says, created by black people, for black people, and now a pillar of white supremacist capitalism. If you consume coffee, you are helping an industry built on racism. They also come out with an article saying milk is too. I don't know what we're supposed to drink. Great soda. You can't have water. You can't have grape soda. Wait. Cherry Kool-Aid. That's racist. Well, how is that racist? Wait, why can't you have water? Because clean water is like for white people. Yeah, that, yeah. No! Yes. And you can't have... Wait, but if you can't have milk, then couldn't you have coffee? You could have chocolate milk. Because it's the opposite. You could milk in your black coffee and you turn it white. That's the most racist than you could possibly do. That's true. You can swirl it up. I mean, the euphemism's abound. Is this coffee too black for you? You need a white milk. White milk. Half an F. What are you saying, Sarah? Which half are you trying to put in this coffee? Maybe I just like Obama. I want some caffeine now. Half and half. I know. I will never sub... You know what? If that's being a white supremacist, I am a white sp. Oh, don't say it. We're going to clip out just that. Put your hand down, Chad. Never a good episode of the news. Go check out Zore museum store.
