    "text": " Hello and welcome to Hysteria. I'm Erin Ryan. And I'm Alyssa Mastromonico. Alyssa, did we get Wednesday again this week? We're getting Wednesday again. Wah, Wah. We're getting Wednesday'd but like on a Thursday, I think, or a Friday. Something. I just, you know, fucking hate the Supreme Court. I'm just gonna say no matter what happens over the next, you know, three days in the 13 cases that they've yet to announce the decisions on, I just, I fucking hate them. I'm over it. You know, it's pretty funny because you have to assume that this decision is done in Dustin, right? And so what I wonder is, like, you know, my mom always told me, damn into the torpedo, when you've got to face bad news, just take it head on. It feels like they might be being Pussies with this one. Yeah, they might be being Pussies. Well, we'll see. This week, we are joined by Dana Schwartz and Julissa Arse to tackle the following questions. What does whatever the Supreme Court is about to do mean for the future of reproductive justice? Are we on the cusp of another anti-feminist backlash who actually deserves to be canceled? All this and more right now. All right, so as we alluded to in our cold open, we record this show on Wednesdays. So if something happens between Wednesday recording and Thursday release, we're sort of SOL. So whenever, you know, January 6th was a Wednesday, good example of something. Sure was. We went in ready to talk about Hilaria Baldwin with SE Cup. We came out like we cannot air this conversation about Hilaria Baldwin with SE Cup. This week, we've got to hold it. Some stuff happened. So this week, the Supreme Court announced just before we recorded that there will be two more decision days this week, Thursday and Friday. Usually they only release decisions Monday and Wednesday. This is such useless information and I can't believe how silly their rules are. But once or twice a year, we have to learn about their weird ass calendar. It's like trying to learn the rules of cricket. I don't get it. So something tells me that there's some elderly justices who really want to get these like 13 cases out of the way real fast because they want to do like carefree rich guy shit. Like I mean, or they've watched too many episodes of the West Wing and think that they can dump the bad ones on a Friday and we won't notice. That's true. But then they would have dumped it next week, which is right before a holiday weekend. But you know what, then maybe they didn't want to risk their holiday weekend being ruined by vitriol. Right. Right. Maybe they got to let it cool down before they can like piece for me. Sima, Sima, Sima. Exactly. They want to have like a like a week before they can like waltz into a steakhouse acting like a big shot. I feel like that's a that's an activity of like really the most annoying type of beltway people. Yeah, like the steakhouse big shots. Yeah, it's like, let's go to the cap grill and have a stoli doli. Oh my god. I saw Kevin McCarthy at the cap grill in DC one time just being thinking he was the greatest. It's just like God. That's see that's the difference between me and Kevin McCarthy because I would go to the cap grill just for the stoli doli. Because it's all I could afford. I would go to the cap grill and be like, I just all I wanted is a giant piece of meat. And this is nothing to be proud of. I am like, this is a shameful exercise for me. So, you know, in the talking about the Supreme Court, there's a few important cases that are going to come down before the end of the term. Dobs is the one that we've all had our eye on because that's the one that everyone thinks will flush, row down the toilet. And Alyssa, you and I don't know the outcome of that case. No, like, not only the justices do, right? Like, well, the justices in like probably Jenny Thomas and whatever insane people. She's probably got it on text somewhere. Yeah, yeah, frickin Dobbs, whatever insane people. She says frickin not me. She totally says frickin. I just think like it's funny to imagine that like one of the most consequential decisions in American history because half of the population requires reproductive health care. So, it's one of the most consequential decisions in history. And it's kind of funny, like bleakly funny to imagine like Jenny Thomas, like, you know, having a couple glasses of Shubli and then scrolling through her contacts and be like, who am I going to text about this? This is all just, I have no idea what no, we're just made this is just making us feel a little better. This is fanfic. So maybe 30 people, let's say maybe there are some clerks, some, some justices know what is about to happen. But people are going to listen to this knowing what happened. So in that spirit, we're going to record three different news portions about this. Yeah, right. Totally. In the movie clue how they do all three of the endings, you know, yes. Or in 30 Rock when they when they pre tape a disaster relief segment with Jenna, to be ahead of the game, be ahead of the game and win the ratings war, you know, to help the people the thing that happened happened to. So in that spirit, we're going to we're going to tape three outcomes. So here's outcome number one. Something close to the Alito draft that was leaked a month ago is the final ruling. And not only is Roe overturned, American women have been tied to a rocket ship with the Federalist Society logo on it and blasted back to 1873. So Alyssa, that just happened. What the fuck? What the fuck Aaron seems like what we thought was going to happen has indeed happened. And abortion is no longer safe and legal, but will still happen. Yes, it will happen unsafely. It will happen illegally. And you know, this is this is far from the start. There are states across the country that are trying to pass crazier and crazier laws. The reason I said 1873 is because that was the year of the Comstock laws, which made it illegal to distribute information about contraception or abortion over mail, because there was a guy named Comstock who was America's foremost prude read up on him. He is one of the craziest bitches in American history. So we're heading back there. You know, you and I are in blue states. I fear for the future country that my daughter will be growing up in. And I fear for the future that everybody, especially people who are more marginalized, are already living under. Yes. I mean, if this is the ruling in about half the states in America, abortion is now illegal. Yeah. And here's something that really, you know, makes me furious. There's always this sort of flippant dumbass who is like, well, you can just move or like offering a very complicated solution as though it's a simple and easy solution. Another one is just adopt. Well, there's always adoption. Okay, fucko, you carry a baby for nine months and then go through all of that and then just relinquish the baby. It's easy. Like it's easy. Like, are you fucking kidding me? You're going to go through nine months of that and then just be like, you know what, you know, this was fine. Now I can just adopt, my body hasn't changed forever. You know, this isn't a long recovery. No matter how I give birth, you know, this isn't a major ordeal. This isn't going to fuck with my mental health. This isn't going to fuck with my physical health. This isn't going to fuck with my sexual health, with my relationships, with my ability to work. I can just adopt. Fuck you. Also, just move. That's another one that just moved. That's it. That's another one that can completely fuck off. People grew up places. People have roots just because people have jobs. People have jobs. Some people lack economic mobility. It's expensive to move, especially if you already have kids, especially if they're in school. What are you supposed to do? What are you supposed to do? What are you supposed to do? Especially if you have a mortgage now and interest rates are growing up. Yeah, that's a there's a lot happening. I just I just really I want there to be a holiday where all that like I want there to be like identified dumbasses. Like, you know, you get something in the mail that's like a jury summons that's like, Hey, you're a fucking dumbass. No talking. The last week in June, it's a dumbass free week. Will you get a free vacation to this mountain cabin where there's no Wi-Fi and no talking free free vacation? But you know, nobody else has to listen to you for that week. We need a dumbass vacation. Okay. That was pretty good. That was a good option. Yeah, works. If the Alito draft is close to what's released, I think that that works. Okay. Option two, scotas strikes down row, but only by upholding the Mississippi law, which bans abortions after 15 weeks, which means that abortion access is seriously weakened, that row is essentially overturned, that Casey is essentially overturned, and also conservative justices that swung away from Alito look like heroes, right? Right. Like whatever conservative justices behind the scenes are doing the maneuvering, they're going to come out and be like, wow, heroes to America's moderate. Alyssa are let's just say I'm going to say who those people. It would probably be Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh. Are the heroes are Amy Cone? No, okay. No, they just get a protest is at this point. They're scared of protesters, and I think they just want to have their abortion and eat it too. That was grosser than when you split you said last night. What did I say last? Oh, don't throw the abortion out with the bath water. Yeah. That was that let's put a pin in that one. I'll bring that one up too in our personal political conversation today. Because I got it. I got it in my back pocket. Yeah, I think that this was something that Roberts wanted in the first place. If you listen to legal analysts like on our other crooked media podcast, Drick scrutiny, which has been completely amazing as a source of information on this. Justice Roberts is somebody who fancies himself a reasonable moderate by the law kind of person, even though he's very conservative. And I think that most people who are Supreme Court watchers and reporters think that Roberts wanted it to come out this way so that they would be able to be credited for weakening Roe, but also not be these insane, like completely out of line with the American public's opinions out of touch body that is losing relevance by the day, even though it is. Also, I think that he has enough ego and hubris that he doesn't want the Supreme Court to devolve into utter chaos on his watch. It already has. I know, but you know, it could get worse. Right. I mean, remember when he saved Obamacare? That was crazy. I know. That was crazy, which brings me to option number three. Outcome number three is something insane happens that nobody predicted. And Roberts has somehow figured out a way to save both face and Roe v. Wade. So they issue one of those mealy mouth opinions that kind of just like kicks it back down to the lower court, which would strike the law, I believe. And also kick the can down the road so that maybe the Supreme Court can do the same thing the next time a case like this comes up because there are plenty of cases that are coming up. But this one is so like, it's so stinky from, yeah, from like the leaks and the Alito of it all. It's just like, like, stinky. Yeah, it's really stinky. So nobody saw this coming, Alyssa. Did you think this happened? I know. What is it? It's like Scoop. It's crazy. It's crazy. It's just like in 2012, was it? When Roberts saved Obamacare? 2012 or 2012? Sometimes was sometime in the middle during the salad days, Alyssa. Oh, God. Oh, it's such a great time. It's heaven. Summer music was like 90% bops. It was like, I mean, Beyonce is attempting to bring them back valiantly. So, is he at 2012, 2013 was maybe the peak, the peak of my adult life. It was very fun. You know, in terms of like the sociopolitical situation. Yeah, of course. Everybody was feeling pretty good. Obamacare was saved by a vain chief justice. You know, I'm shocked. I'm shocked this happened. I'm shocked the Supreme Court didn't go ham, but I expect that they will go ham in the future. And I hope people listen to us when we warn about it from now on. Yes, yes. Because look at the states are showing their hands. Look what they are. They are ready to fucking go. I mean, they're already all of their, their activist groups are ready. They are ready. Yeah. So I got to say, it's been over the last maybe like five years that I realized that maybe my strategy for dealing with this, this sort of winged nuttery throughout my adult life has been like, I'll just wait for them all to die. Like I'm a let, you know, all these people are old. I'll just stick around. Eventually they'll be dead and I'll still be alive. And it'll, here's the thing. I think that while their numbers are dwindling, the people who are kind of at the tip of the sphere for conservative pet causes are so annoying and so awful that they've driven most reasonable people out of public service. Yeah, at this point. And it's like not, I'm not going to outlive them. Because there's always going to be one real young idiot. I mean, the youngers are crazy now than the elders. Dude, did I tell you I got a DM from Tommy Lauren? No, she demmed me and asked me if I had gone or show. And I was, I said something diplomatic, or I said, you know, can I see reels of you talking to somebody with my opinions on your show? I'm not interested in having a conversation that is just talking point sword fights. Right. I'm not going to go on her show because I'm not interested in being on the radar of the type of person who watches her show 100%. You know, and that's that kind of brings me around to what I'm saying is like, I'm not going to outlive these people. Like there is enough people that are just off their rockers. Yeah. That it's like public service feels dangerous and at the very best annoying for a lot of people. As someone who was a public servant for a long time, there is nothing you could offer me that would make me go back. Nothing. Yeah. Well, we got to fix it because people like you and me have to start like running. I know, I know, but it's like, you know what, think about it. Look at look at what they did to the election workers, not only nonpartisan, hard fucking working people who's only joy, not only joy, that's hyperbolic, but who's professional joy was just making sure people voted. They didn't care for who and they have run them out of the system by targeting them and making their lives miserable. So yeah, we're up Schitt's Creek. Yeah, we're up Schitt's Creek and that concludes option three, but it segues nicely into what we are going to talk about anyway, which is something that we know happened, which is the January 6th committee met again this week and as Alyssa alluded to, it basically painted a picture of a fandom congregation of Donald Trump who are just rabid and completely devoted to ruining the lives of anybody who stands in the way of Donald Trump getting what he personally wants, which is very weird to me. It's terrible. It's like mad Max, but worst costume design, you know, bad oversized cheap suits. Yeah, and none of them can drive. Have you ever been on a highway with one of the Punisher truck people and you're just like, oh, those trucks are scary. They're scary because they're so big that, you know, they will get into accidents because those people can't drive and they're big enough that they can hurt people. And the actual Punisher logo is in fact terrifying, but also like the Punisher hated cops. That's like the one that's like the first, I don't know. I don't know anything about like comic books at all, not because I, you know, it's just not my thing. But that's the one thing I know about the Punisher is that he did not like the lead. That's what we're gonna do. His main thing. Guys, I don't. Okay, so let's get back to the January 6th committee hearing. Alyssa, you mentioned the poll workers who were totally terrorized by misinformation, disinformation. I want to talk a little bit about Rusty Bowers, which I do not believe is a real name. It's a dog name. I know, but, but it's seemingly a good man. He's trying to be a good man, except he thinks God wrote the Constitution, which we are all skipping over the fact that that is an objective. That is wacky. That is wacky, but that is some southwestern wackiness. And we really need that as some like, you know, we know God didn't write the Constitution, a bunch of like 18 to 25 year old dudes who didn't want to pay taxes did. And then plus one horny old guy Ben Franklin, you know, like, anyway, um, I was impressed by him. He seemed like he was, he was doing the best that he could within his moral framework. What did you think of Rusty Bowers? I was into Rusty, you know, it's like, it's, it is a, it's something to really think about, right? When you have the White House calling you, like right now, I guess it's so hard to think about because Donald Trump has so diminished the office, but like these people were calling him and he stood up to them. And that is, I mean, in the same way the elected officials in Georgia did. And that's not a small thing. Because what we learned yesterday is that this wasn't some like ham, handed drunk Rudy Giuliani play here. This was, they were really coordinated. They had a real fucking plan. Like they had made all kinds of like real lies up that they were trying to feed these people. It just, it seems it wasn't as, I guess juvenile plan or strategy as we may have thought, you know, there was really, there were a lot of players and they were all working to get these people to overturn what was a free and fair election. And so Rusty, I mean, it's, it's so interesting. We were talking about this a little yesterday, but it's like, imagine if like, I, we always say we never want to overly praise people for doing the bare minimum. But I think about if Rusty had been a Democrat, right, it would have been so easy for Trump to be like, conspiracy, conspiracy, see, they're not doing it. And in some ways, these two states that ended up being so critical to the outcome of the election, Georgia and Arizona, having Republicans in place, I mean, has actually kind of made this something for which Donald Trump may actually get in trouble for because they're Republicans. They voted for Trump. I mean, I think that's the other thing with all this is that these people fucking voted for him and they're still like, dude, stop. Well, and Rusty Bowers did say that he would vote for him again, which is like, okay, well, that's it. You look, you had me, you're testifying before Congress right now, because he tried to pressure you. Oh my God, it reminds you of that meme that's like, they had us in the first half not gonna lie. That's how I feel about, I'm like, okay, Rusty. I think Rusty, though, may be saying this because he just look at the onslaught that these lunatic MAGA people have ranked like they have reigned hellfire on these people that were just following the law. So I guess if I were him, I might say I'd vote for him too, just to sort of like, make sure there were fewer nuts on my lawn come tomorrow. Right. So I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna be paranoid here, or I'm gonna put my dystopia hat on. I love when you do that. Here's a question that I've been asking myself a lot, because you have people like Rusty Bowers and you have those poll workers in Georgia who were victimized by MAGA people and they talk about Gabe Sterling and all of these, all these people saying they got all these death threats and people calling the cops. Here's my question. How many of those people were real? And I don't mean that these people are making things up. I mean, I think that there are forces on the right that use like Russian type tactics and possibly employ bot armies and like other things that in order to kind of like egg on there, the small number of people who are very frothy about them. Right. So I do believe that there is, yeah, the Amber Heard stuff also, yeah, gamergate stuff. Like a lot of the people, I think that eventually we'll find out that a lot of the people sending death threats and amplifying these messages were bots. And what that served to do was encourage the very, they're much smaller than we think number of people who were like on the edge of like being nuts to actually be nuts. It was like, does that make sense? No, it's kind of like a safety and numbers thing, right? Right. Like they thought that they had, if you think there are hundreds of thousands of people on your side, you're going to feel like a hero if you're the one who goes and goes to comment pizza or whatever. Right. Or goes and shows up at shows up at Shea Moss's grandmother's house and tries to make a citizen's fucking arrest. You know, like it is there are enough people who do the in-person ship that you don't want to, you don't want to hedge. Right. You know, totally. And I'm not downplaying the fact that these people are legitimately threatened. I think that the people, the real people making the threats were probably egged on by some total Russian ass disinfo troll farm extremely weird stuff. And here's another reason that I think that that is the case. Like there have been all of these right wing events that were supposedly going to be like massively attended that just like, you know, maybe had a lot of buzz in the right wing media sphere that just ended up having like a small number of people there. Do you mean like Trump's inauguration? Yeah, exactly. Exactly. I think if you if you checked Twitter and like extreme Trumpy Twitter, and again, this is just me, I'm just guessing, but based on how a lot of these like viral shit storms resulting in death threats have gone, I believe that there will probably eventually find out that there has been some amplification. And that I think is so awful and so damning of the types of tactics that the Trump team is willing to employ. They're willing to use distort like internet reality in order to froth up dangerous people. And wow, that sucks. They're bad people. I think you just summarized this entire presidency in one sentence. Wow, that sucks. Yeah, I did attend college. That's true. Let's see one more quick thing. You know, we don't have the ruling in jobs yet, but I did want to circle back to why am I using corporate speak lately? Circle back. Is it because I miss going into an office? No, you do not miss going into an office. I am wearing a blazer today. I know it's beautiful. It's it's a I got it from Target. I love it. Yeah, no, we're just circle back to the abortion thing because I think it's important for people to understand that it's not just, you know, a court making a decision. There are real people who are impacted by this right now. And there are clinics across the country in states with trigger laws on the books that are halting appointments for abortions because the minute that the ruling comes down, abortions, legal abortions will end in the state. My home state of Wisconsin Planned Parenthood is not scheduling abortions after June 25th, Oklahoma and South Dakota basically can't get legal people there who need reproductive care. Can I get an abortion in Oklahoma and South Dakota? Missouri is not accepting new appointments at their only abortion clinic. It is it's not great. It's not good. The Red River Women's Clinic in Fargo, North Dakota is still open, fully open. But, you know, if the Supreme Court case comes down the way, we think it's going to trigger ban. So that's pretty bad. So I feel like none of the practitioners actually think that scenario three in our news is going to happen. What if what would you do if it did? Like, do we celebrate or are we just sort of do we just sort of celebrate by not crying? I think we celebrate by not crying because it's not over. You know, this Supreme Court's going to be the Supreme Court for a really fucking long time. And, you know, I mean, it's like they'll see. I mean, if it is scenario three, they'll see how people respond. Yeah, I mean, I guess I would respond to it like a clean bill of health from the doctor. You know, it's like, okay, I don't celebrate going to the doctor and the doctor's like, you're fine. It's like, cool. Good. No further testing necessary. So yeah, I think that a lot of people, if it is scenario one or scenario two, by the end of the summer, I think that there will be some a lot of people will realize that it's a lot worse than yeah, they thought it was going to be what an up, up way to end the news. We're going to talk about the shooting in Uvalde. But we've run out of time. So hopefully next week we can talk more about all the ways that the cops completely failed, abdicated all responsibility to the children in that room. It was like, you know, real quick before we end, it was as though the police are all like the dumbest and most cowardly people in town. They've been given guns and told that they're the only ones who can protect people. And then they just don't do their jobs. The door wasn't even locked in. It might when I first heard that, I thought, darkly about, you know, that far side comic mid veil school for the gifted, where it says pull and the kid is like pushing. I was like, wow, those are the cops, except they're supposed to be rescuing people. And they cannot even open a goddamn door. Nope. Just horrifying. Okay, we'll talk more about this in the in the future as we get more updates on it. Each one keeps getting worse. But first we're going to take a quick break when we come back. We've got a couple more people to join us for a discussion about whether or not the future is still female. And welcome back. Welcome to the future. The future used to be female. The future was female, right? Elizabeth, the future a little while was female. Is there a tense in English that is like the future was once this, but now is not that. I think there's a in French, there's it there is such a tense, but not in Latin, maybe in like Hungarian finish. We're big and hungry. Yeah, we're cute. Are we? Yeah. Yeah. Congratulations. Wow. We were a top podcast and hungry there for a while. That's a great that's great information. I'm really excited to talk about this with this group of wonderful panelists today. So I'm going to bring them in right away. First off, she's a writer her book, you sound like a white girl, the case for rejecting assimilation is out. Now go buy it. Jaleesa are say welcome. Welcome. I don't know why I just welcome to myself. It's like when you get food and they're like, enjoy your meal. No, and you're like, me, you too. You too. Yeah, you too. I don't know. I haven't I haven't touched my coffee yet. I just wanted to give a really quick thank you to the hysteria listeners that have been coming out to all my book events and they tell me how much they love the show and how they heard about the book because of the show. So thank you all for having me on and thank you to the hysteria listeners who are so supportive. They're just the best. Y'all are the best. Absolutely. The best. Up next, she's a New York Times best-selling author. Her book Anatomy A Love Story is out. If you haven't read it already, I think everyone's bought it. But if you haven't, you should buy it. She also has her own podcast, Noble Blood Dana Schwartz. Thank you so much for having me. This is very exciting. I feel like as soon as literally when Caroline, the producer texted like, okay, do you want to come on? Are we talking about I started typing? Like I was like, oh, the article. We're talking about the article. Great. I'm so excited. Oh, this is a week where we have two of the articles. There's like, which one of them is going to be my I feel petty. So don't worry. We're not, we're not missing out. I mean, yeah, it's a big article. You don't want to be the main character on the internet, right? Never. No. Although I think this is a good example of a the article where the writer Michelle Goldberg, who I think is one of the New York Times's greatest columnist, especially now, she's not the like person. Nobody's like, Oh, Michelle, what are you doing? But Michelle Goldberg wrote a piece that was in the New York Times this week. The future isn't female anymore. And it's basically about a shying away from the term feminist by younger people, younger women, and kind of infighting among people who should kind of be agreeing on a lot of issues, but instead of defending territory that we've gained, they're like arguing semantics or getting into slap fights and sort of like ignoring that and then conservatives, you know, before you know it, nobody gets an abortion anymore. We all have to be pregnant. We all have to give birth. That sucks. So this is sort of a great opportunity, I think, for us to talk about this. I think it's like Goldberg's piece really, really honed in on something that I think a lot of us have kind of felt. And that is like the term feminism and contemporary feminism hasn't really done much for us, you know, and it hasn't really advanced much for people. It feels like more of a to a lot of people, it feels like more of a superficial title that doesn't really have a lot of heft in it, instead of an ideology that's about like skull knocking and boatrocking. So, Jaleesa, you came with an annotated copy of a book. And so I really want to start this conversation with you. What did you think about Michelle Goldberg's piece? Do you agree that contemporary feminism has become sort of cringe and it's slowed down due to infighting? What do you think about this whole conversation? I thought the article was a little cringe. You did. For me. Yeah, because I think I felt like, I felt like she never really told me exactly what it is that she was feeling. I was like, is she trying to defend feminism? Or is she trying to point out the things that are wrong with feminism is she invalidating the very real concerns that particularly women of color have brought to the forefront about feminism? I could never quite get what she was saying. And it just left me feeling like she was trying to defend feminism and never quite really hit on the points or validated, really truly validated the issues that people have brought forward. And I think part of what made me feel so like, uh, about the article is that and maybe about feminism more broadly or white women's feminism to be completely honest is that it seems like feminism to her based on the article is about two things. It's about reproductive rights and domestic abuse as it was, um, displayed, you know, or maybe took a step back or whatever side of the field you're on with Amber Heard. And so if feminism is only those two things, then then it's not, it's not encapsulating everything that to me as a Mexican American immigrant woman, feminism is about. There was, there was no mention about, you know, to me feminism is also about not just women's right to choose and the fact that we should not be domestically abused, but it's also about, uh, no domestic workers, uh, who don't have the same rights as everyone else who are often not paid for wages whose employers would hold their, their wages. It's about migrant women in detention centers. It's about the fact that, um, white women's and Latina women's wage gap. Okay. So the wage gap between white women and Latina women is wider. It's bigger than that of white women to white men. So to me, feminism is about all these things. And if, and then therefore, I am like, uh, you know, a super feminist because I care about all of these things, but it does become difficult when feminism is viewed at only through white women's lenses. And the book that I brought informs a lot of how I think about feminism and about the history of feminists. Um, it's, it's called Chicana Mobitas. And it's, it's a lot of Chicana Mexican American feminists who are giving us a history about feminism in the 60s and 70s that I had never heard before. And then I had never heard of these feminists and everything they did for all women. And, and so I pulled it out last night because I wanted to see just, you know, how these women felt about feminism in the 70s. And it turns out they felt kind of the same. So I think part of the problem is also we've never really reckoned with the harm that white feminism has done to feminism. Mm hmm. I think that's such an interesting point. And one thing that I got from Goldberg's piece, was it seemed to me like she was sort of doing the, a vibe shift is coming thing. Like we're coming up on a backlash and we better get ready. Um, and I like, she talked to Susan Felutie who wrote backlash in like, I think, 1991. 91. Okay. But it was all about like the cultural clawback that happened in the 80s over gains that were made in the 70s. And, um, I find it to be really interesting, Julissa, because what you bring up is that like there's a backlash that's coming from the left because the left sees it and the left and marginalized people, um, who are not like, you know, white, the white suburban female voter, you know, that, that a lot of times is like, you know, pictured in the pink pussy hat and women's marching and all that stuff. Um, I think that part of the backlash is coming from people who are like feminism has never served me. So like, why would I identify with it? And then the other part of the backlash is coming from like conservative voices who are like, ha ha, like feminism should not exist period. Like, you know, like there's, Julissa, you say that, you know, it should serve more people and it should actually address concerns that impact all women, like regardless of their socioeconomic status, it should be more intersectional. And then we have like a conservative backlash that's like, you have fuck, fuck these ladies go home and work. Um, Dana, I wonder what you thought about the article and whether or not you're seeing this backlash happening already. Absolutely. I mean, I think Julissa's dead on in terms of like the article did not cover the broad range of, I think, problems with like the word feminism. It's like a pillar that too much is being, you know, trying to be, be supported by that one word. Like, there's like a broad range of issues that the word feminism is trying to encapsulate and to, to not a successful degree. I think what, what the article was really touched on for me that I think I hadn't really seen in print before was this idea that feminism won a lot, a bunch of symbolic victories in terms of like, for a period feminism was really popular and trendy and you could wear t-shirts in public that said, I'm a feminist and that was great. But because there was that influx of just visible representation without much behind it. Like, while we were winning these symbolic, I think like arguably capitalist victories because companies were realizing it was profitable just to slap feminist on things and it would sell more like Republican lawmakers were winning actual tangible victories. And so then rightly, especially marginalized women who weren't seeing the benefits of feminism being plastered everywhere when it was just like, you know, privileged white women who were making a profit from this. Like, of course they're going to, we're all going to feel like distanced and a little bit betrayed because the victories hadn't been actual policy victories. I think that you, the capitalist aspect of it is, is interesting. Emily Favreau and I had a long-standing running joke where whenever we saw a shirt that said something about feminism on it that cost more than $100, we would like take a picture of it and send it to each other. Wait, Emily and I did that too. That's so funny. Well, you're cheating on me. That's fine. If I'm going to merge the text. Yeah, if it's going to be an inside, I think that's a great inside joke to have with a lot of people because I think Dana, you're totally right that it, once people realized it was something that could be sold, it got kind of defanged. Like it became instead of like, okay, feminism is about ensuring equal access to reproductive care for all women and all people who need reproductive care, regardless of their income, regardless of their socioeconomic status, whether or not they have children, whatever their race is, they should all have access to health care that is quality. That seems like something that we should have always been fighting for. Not like, I felt like through the marketing lens, it kind of became every woman deserves to be beautiful. Yeah, it's like women should be empowered, but it didn't mean anything. It just meant like, I guess continuing to make money in these profitable ways that didn't actually challenge anything. Right. Right. Elissa, what do you think? So it was interesting because the article hit me a little bit different than I thought it would, because the reason I knew off the top of my head the date that backlash was published by Susan Floudy is because I was a sophomore in high school. And we went to the bookstore when it came out. I think we saw Susan Floudy on the Today Show or something and we went to the bookstore and we got the book and it was like our Bible. Like we carried it around, we quoted parts of the book to each other. It was like a very meaningful thing. And then my freshman first, I mean, it was maybe two weeks into my freshman semester in college is when President Clinton signed the Violence Against Women Act, right? Which I remember so vividly too, because Lifetime TV for Women was one of the only times a television network had lobbied Congress on behalf of anything. And I remember there were these commercials and they were really a part of making sure here was this TV channel that women watched and they were like, we fucking hear you. And we make all these shows about women who get beaten up and like, maybe we should do something about it. And so that was a time like when I was so young that I remember action, like shit was happening. And now here I am many, many years later. And we're doing an entire show about whether Rose is going to be overturned this week. And so when I really sat down and think about it after I read the article, I thought she made some very good points, which is like we've turned it into like feminism has become sort of like something for social media, like something to buy a kutra month to express your support, right? You've got the mug, you've got the hot, you've got the sweatshirt. Do I have sweatshirts? Sure, I do. Not gonna pretend like I don't. But I think that and at the time you think you're supporting an organization, right? Like that's how it started. Organizations that were doing the work would sell merch so that you would buy it to give them money. And then it became just like any brand out there was selling this stuff. And you were like, oh, you look back on it, you're like, why do I have that gap sweatshirt? You know, it's like, and what was I doing and what was I thinking? And so I thought she had a lot of good points. And it's like, what is the intention of feminism now? And there's no one group that's the spear. You know, I think also back when all of these movements started, there were far fewer organizations, right? And so now it's like, well, what organizations actually doing the work? And why am I donating to this one instead of this one? And like, what are your stated goals and principles? And I think that it's very hard to understand now. And because of that, it's people are less active. And I think also for people who have been active for a long time, and they see all the backsliding, like everything that's happening with Roe, you're like, and like, Julissa said, you know, the wage gap between Hispanic women and white women hasn't gotten better, it's gotten worse, and it's worse than it is. It's like, what's happening then? Like, how is anything working? Yeah, I do feel as though white feminism has felt like I got mine and like kind of abandoned and continuing the fight for people who don't have what they need, you know? Like, I got my almost equal pay, like our producer Fiona pointed out to me in a conversation we had the other week that in some cities, what women and men make, if they are similar education levels, is exactly the same. There is no wage gap. There's only a wage gap when you introduce different like race categories. And that is a concern. You know, that's not a concern that went away just because in some places white women get paid the same thing as white men. It should be a concern for every woman until every, all of the wage gaps are erased. You know, it's sort of like the most privileged people get what they're, what they want, and then stop fighting. Julissa, I wanted to kind of talk about what you were, you were kind of saying that the article implied that there was something wrong with feminism but didn't quite get to it. Do you, there's a part of me that thought that maybe she was going to get into like semantic debates. Do you know what I'm talking about? Do you think that's what was implied? Like, I'm genuinely curious. Like, yeah, yeah. So I think, so just a quick comment, you know, I think that that when we say, you know, the wage gap doesn't exist in some places, it does still exist, right? Because of what you said, like introducing race to it. But like, you can't, you can't disconnect the two, you know? So I think even like, and I think that's, that's to me the biggest problem with feminism is that it always centers white women. And once white women, once there is no wage gap for white women, then we go around saying there's no more wage gap in cities where it's like, actually, no, there's still wage gap. Exactly. Yeah. Once we say, oh, the US has like low mortality rate for giving birth. And it's like, well, no, because black women are still dying when they're giving birth, like much higher rates. So there's still a problem. You know, so I think that's, to me, that's like one of the biggest problems. And you kind of mentioned it, right? When you said, is it is feminism sort of one of those things where once the most privilege are good, then we sort of like put our little tennis shoes to the side, you know? Yeah. I mean, just to jump in real quick, it reminds me of what that I think Senator from Louisiana said about his state's maternal mortality rate. Basically, like it's only high because of black women. It's like, Well, yeah, Senator Kennedy, thank you so much. Yeah. So it's high among women, women. What the fuck are you talking about? So like that was a, I think that was a moment where he was America's foremost white feminist in the way that you're talking about it. That's exactly kind of, I think, the kind of framing of this issues that always centers white people in this in this struggles. And when we do that, you know, we're missing a big part of the fight and we're missing a big part of the people who could really be energized to be part of the fight who don't feel like our needs are being served or centered in this conversation. So I, and I think that that kind of leads into your question about what she talked about semantics. I mean, a little bit, I felt like she was going there and then she stopped herself like, oh, maybe some of these things are valid and it's not just like petty little infites. But you know, I mean, I think even towards the end, she says that it's like it's painful, right? Like it's painful how feminism has been attacked from so many different in so many different directions. And whether, whether fighting about the things that are wrong with feminism leads to then less rights for women overall, right? I do think she was kind of going there. And I think you can do both things. You can be critical of the movements in which you are in. And at the same time, yes, we all collectively should have similar things that are driving us, right? Like we all should want there for women to have a choice about what to do with their bodies. We should all be behind like women getting this paid the same as men like, yes, and those things are getting attacked from from the right. And I think we should try to build movements that can withstand the very needed criticism and change that needs to happen with their movements. And at the same time, keep fighting against, you know, the quote unquote, like real enemy. Like, I think we should be able to do both of those things. Because if you don't have a healthy movement, if you kind of don't have a strong movement, then any push from the right is going to topple it. Right? So you've got to make sure you've got a strong base. And I don't think we do. And I will argue that when, because feminism has sort of been defanged, as you said, and become sort of this commercial thing for just like any company to slap on a t-shirt, and it's become, or at least the symbolism of it has become sort of chuggy for lack of a better word, it diminishes our ability then to mobilize for the actual important policy changes that we need. Then we don't have that, you know, those symbols no longer have the power that we need in order to galvanize and make people excited so that we can actually make policy changes. You know, as we're having this discussion, I have been thinking a lot about a stat about Gen Z. And Gen Z is much more queer identified than any generation that came before. I think one in six members of Gen Z are queer. And so there's a part of me that thinks that having a conversation about like men versus women, you know, in such a binary way will be seen not as pass\u00e9, but as a little bit outdated within a few years. I don't know, like, Alyssa, what do you make of that? I think that's probably true, and I think that means that there needs there needs to be new alliances for lack of a better word, because like what's not diminishing is the role of white men, you know, and so I think that, you know, if we look at how the pie is divided, if we're talking about like work, right, like professional jobs or whatever, like the amount of like white men is not shrinking, it's just that the one piece of the pie is, you know, available to everyone. I think there just needs to be more alliance building because like the real changes and the space that needs to be made for other people to have a seat at the table is not increasing. They're just making like smaller groups of people. Right fight for fight against each other instead of the people who really still retain all the power. Yeah, that's an interesting point. Here's something that was brought up in the article that has been like haunting me, and that is the characterization of feminism as cringe, and whether or not a movement should even care about whether or not it's cringe, like our social movements kind of by their definition, confrontational, sometimes annoying, interrupting, you know, aren't they kind of inherently cringe? Julie, is there like should feminism want to be cool? That's a funny question. I guess it depends on like who is describing it as cringe, you know, it's like if the right is describing it as cringe, then like who gives a fuck? Like I don't care what you think, you know, like, yeah, you can think I'm cringe, whatever. If it's sort of like people who are on the last and who see like the problems and who you know, think that it's cringe, then like maybe we should kind of look at it. But but if we're being called cringe because we're not cool, then like, yeah, who cares? Like that doesn't, that doesn't matter, you know, being what is being cool? Anyways, like what is cool? I will say the problem with being cringe, I agree completely that being cool doesn't matter, but it it also diminishes, I think the ability to like get young people excited into what the movement actually could be. Yeah, I think that that some of what feels a little bit cringe to me just like as a cultural observer is that the there are people who really were a part of something that made a political difference at a, you know, at a time, remember like the women's march, going to the women's march? And there are these like middle aged white ladies all hanging out in groups, you know, like carrying signs and like the people who live in the $5 million homes and put the signs in their yard, they're like, in this house, we believe in science, love is love, like that sort of a thing. But you know, they would be the first people to call the police on a homeless person who was like camped in the, you know, yard between the sidewalk and the street. I think that that's maybe what the cringe of it all is, is sort of like there's a lot, there's a sort of like nimbyism in feminism where it like doesn't seem to want to engage with the stuff that's like confrontational. I don't know if I don't keep using that word, but I don't know if like social movements should just be all fun all the time. I think that in a lot of cases, it's just like you, what you're doing is you're going to be annoying until things change. One of the authors cited in the article specifically says what is cringe is that the movement has tried and failed. And that's what makes it cringe. And I totally disagree with that. Yeah, to me, it is cringe to have failed and not admit you're failing. Like it's, it's cringe to be like, we're fucking killing it when you're not fucking killing it. That is cringe. But to try and fail, I mean, so should no one fucking try. I mean, that literally undermines every movement happening right now that hasn't seen radical success. And so I totally disagreed with that person's point in the article that to try and fail is cringe. That's that is wrong. I think that is wrong. Yeah. And I also would say that it's not a complete failure, you know, like many years, a lot of if we're talking specifically sort of about women's reproductive rights, a lot of women and other people with uteruses have been able to get abortions and have been able, you know, it like it's not perfect. But certainly women have had more rights since, you know, Roe v. Wade was first brought to the Supreme Court. That's just a fact. We have had more rights. Have they been perfect? No. Did we maybe take our foot off the pedal? Because we thought, Oh, we got it now. We're good. Yes. While the right never has taken their foot off the pedal, you know, the moment Roe v. Wade happened is the moment they started, they kept move a license. I would even say started they kept move a license. They were even more energized and they have made it their single number one purpose to overturn Roe v. Wade and they have not stopped. You know, and I do think we kind of took a pause. And so it's time to put our shoes back on and get out there. You know what really strikes me every time there's a moment where it seems like these rights that people had taken for granted are suddenly very tenuous or people realized that they're tenuous. I feel like people who have been plugged into this have to explain over and over again how bad things were very recently. You know, like, I feel like every single time I'm like, Hey, have you heard about Buck v. Bell? Do you know Buck v. Bell, the Supreme Court case that still stands that made it legal for the state to sterilize people against their will. Like that stands that is a supreme in the state of California, for example, was forcibly sterilizing prisoners until shockingly recently. I think that there's just it's I feel as though sometimes I am just on a hamster wheel of re-explaining this stuff over and over again. Like, yeah, you know, birth control was illegal up until like 1964 in some places. Yeah, a woman couldn't get a credit card without having her husband's signature until the 70s. I feel like everybody should know these things at this point. But every time something like this comes up, people are like, what? I had no idea. It's almost like people deliberately don't listen or don't like care to retain any information about like how tenuous these right the rights that we do have are. Julie, so you look like you are saying something. The only thing I was going to say is that like, yes, I do think I do think some of the blame is on us for not knowing. But also, it's like, you don't know what you don't know. Yeah. You know, it's like also our educational system doesn't teach us any of these things. Like, you know, I don't remember learning about Roe B. Wade in like history class. You know, so it's like, where do you learn these things from? Like where? Tick tock. Now tick tock. And then it's also like, okay, well, we can go to tick tock, but also, you know, misinformation. So yes, I would check in the sources, you know, right. Right. And places for people to learn about these things like libraries, public schools are under attack across the country. So while we're in a time when information is like, technically more available, we are losing people who are able to help us sort the information. Librarians, librarians are people who should be able to help us with like media literacy and to obtain information. And there's not enough of them. Teachers are not teaching classes that can be construed as making people feel bad for who they are, which usually just includes making white guys feel bad for who they are. Yeah. It just seems like we're sort of up against it. And I guess maybe I'm going to chuck myself now, because I can be fresh. I'm like old, right? I can be frustrated that people don't know about things like, you know, Buck V. Bell in the history of reproductive rights and reproductive justice in this country. But maybe do you think that Goldberg's piece was getting at the fact that for young people, maybe the barrier to entry for feminism is a little bit almost like strident. Like we're Dana, you're reacting to that. I almost feel like the word feminism, because we don't have that incredibly clear goal now that that I think feminists had in the past, or it was like, protect Roe v. Wade, you know, the past equal rights amendment, like one consolidating thing, I think correctly at this point, like feminism has a lot of iron and a lot of fire. It is harder for young people who aren't as educated on the history of the movement or understand how tenuous the victories we've won are to find out like, what is feminism doing other than selling t-shirts for to make rich people richer? That's a great question. I mean, and like the first thing I'm part about, like the whole history of it too, is that I bet you anything that there are, you know, I mean, I don't think we're old, but since you called us old, Erin, there's a whole generation of adults. I feel like you're old when there are people who are like 25 who are in a different generation than you. When there's like adults coming, oh Fiona, thank you. I'm not old, I promise. I mean, so much. I definitely don't feel old. I definitely have a heart that is like a lot younger than I actually am in years. But I bet you anything that there are quote unquote, and those quotes are Erin's quotes, old feminists, old, old gals who don't know about a lot of history, you know, who don't know about the Madrigal Ten, the women in Los Angeles who were sterilized against their will, because they couldn't speak English. And the judge said that it's because they couldn't speak English, but if and that they were that the reason they were angry is because they got sterilized and therefore could not fulfill their quote unquote Mexican duties of rearing a large family, right? Like there's so much history. I mean, has anybody heard of like Martha Piquotera, who was like an incredible feminist in the 70s who was there at, you know, the the women's meetings who was complaining about Chicana is not being involved in those meetings. Like there's so much more history that people don't know. So it's not just like, you know what I mean? Like, there's so much stuff that people don't know. And and I don't think that that should feel or that that should be a barrier to entry. It's like, let's try to learn it. You know, let's let's be open to new information. Yeah. I mean, I do feel like the tumblerification of like feminist and sociological discussion has sort of made it so people who are maybe new to the discussion end up exposing themselves to people who are at a very different level of knowledge and who are maybe frustrated or tired of explaining themselves what feels like over and over again. And so sometimes when I when I say strident, I don't mean to be sexist, it was using it ironically, but I just wanted to clarify that. I think sometimes the that it's almost like you have to be born a perfect activist or it feels like the community is going to, especially in social media, it feels like you could be punished for not just coming on like a perfectly formed person who knows exactly how to express themselves, who never gets anything wrong. And I think that we're just like, like I have yet to meet that person. Personally, no, I like in real life and in like history, like there's not a single, a single perfect activist, even in the past, even the best of them had flaws. Right. Right. I just I hope that Goldberg's piece about the backlash coming was wrong, but I feel like just the cyclical nature of things and the fact that, you know, Joe Biden is apparently our Jimmy Carter. I worry that we're coming up on a Oh, no, everybody was like, Oh, God, who's going to be the Reagan? Is it going to be Mike Pence? Is it going to be eight years of of Mike? Sorry guys. I think we're we're sort of in a in a moment right now where we're on the edge of things changing and backsliding and not for the better. And we're going to just have to figure out a new way to kind of rise from the ashes because this is like a bad moment. I will also say something that really pisses me off is like the right rise of like ironic trad wifeing like, you know, the fuck is that? Oh, Aaron, do you know what I'm talking about? It's like, yes, young women are like rediscovering and like painting in the language of empowerment, like you could stay at home and just like take care of your babies as if a new thing they're discovering. Oh, right. See, as a as an evolving activist, I ask questions. Yeah, which I think part of feminism and my feminism is I'm like, that is wonderful. Like every woman should have the choice to do what she wants to do. But they're using the language of activism to paint that sort of like retrograde thing as like a new exciting and powering thing where it's like, well, wait, backup, hold on, hold on, right, right, it's like the like sub stack contrarianism comes for her housework. Exactly. That's not a new idea. Yeah, it's an old idea. It's it's gone around that it's now ironic. Right. There was this one, and I wish I remember the people's things, but I don't, but there was this like on Twitter, there was this woman who's running for Congress. And she posted a picture of herself in the bikini and posted next to a picture of a body positive model. And she's like, why are we celebrating her body? Like, I have five kids, and I look like this and like, why are we made to feel ashamed for posting my body? I am proud of my body. And I'm like, that is cring. Like literally no one is telling you not to be proud of your body. That is, she really said, Oh, why is this woman allowed to be proud of her body? But I'm not allowed to be proud of my body. And you're like, who's saying you're not allowed? Do you proud of your body, girl? You look good. So does she? You know, right? Pandemic really accelerated us all getting to the point where we conduct ourselves publicly, as though we're arguing with a mirror. You know, like, have you ever had those like rehearsed like, well, guess what? You're not going to, you know, like a conversation that if you're having it in real life, like, I would fully start crying because that's the it would be such an intense confrontation. But like, in a mirror, I'm like, Oh, yeah, well, you're not good for you that you have five kids. And you look like that. Yeah, five great. I mean, that good. Good for you. That's, that's a, that's a feat. Congratulations on your collagen that you were genetically gifted with. I'm sure you worked hard, but some of that is also nature. Okay, let's take a break. I think we solved feminism once again. I think this is like the eighth time we've solved feminism on the show. Problem solvers on the show. Absolutely. Like in that, this is my second 30 rock reference of the episode. But do you remember the episode where Tracy and Jenna have shirts, they become the problem solvers. And one of them has a shirt that says the problem. This is a solvers. Oh, what an incredible episode. Okay, let's take a quick break. Problem solvers. When we come back, we'll talk about what we're feeling petty about this week. Okay, welcome back. You're still listening to hysteria. I'm still here. Alyssa's still here. Dana's still here and Julissa's still here. We are going to talk about what we are feeling petty about this week. But first, a little housekeeping. If the names Beyonce Drake and Wendy Williams mean anything to you, heard of them. Be sure to check out this week's episode of Keep It. Not only will you get Ira and Lewis's uncensored opinions, but comedian and actor Joel Kimbuster stops by to discuss his new Netflix movie, Fire Island.

All three organizations provide community building, gender affirming, and life-saving resources to the queer and transgender community all year long. So we're excited to be helping out to learn more and pitch in visit crooked.com slash Pride Fund. So next week, we will be pre-recording an episode for the 4th of July week because crooked offices are closed and nobody's going to be working. So we're doing a special solicited advice episode where you can write in questions for us and we answer your questions. We all absolutely love doing these. There's so much fun. I want to come back for that. You're calling it. Yeah, Fiona, mark it down. Julie so wants to come back for solicited advice. But yeah, these are always some of our favorite episodes to do. We love getting your questions. You can send it to us over email hysteria at crooked.com. Sometimes I get them over DM. We prefer email just because that's easier to organize. But if you want to DM me on Twitter or Instagram, I can't guarantee I'll see it. But that's another way to get in touch. You can also, if you don't mind it being public, you can tweet it at us. I'm morning Gloria on Twitter and Alyssa is way master 44. Alyssa, master 44. Alyssa, master 44. You could have just gone by Master Monaco. I wonder if that was all taken. It was all taken. Anything close to my actual name was taken. Wow. It is a master Monaco conspiracy. Yeah, but you could tweet it at us. We'll put out some stuff on social also soliciting solicited advice questions. So you can ask us anything. You can ask us about like career. You can ask us about love. You can ask us about sex, but we will not answer the questions. We'll not answer. Alyssa does not like talking about sex. I don't. I'm a modest lady. Master 44 is in no sex zone or sexual mystery. You can ask the question. But are you allowed to like, like for example, like can I answer? If you answer a sex question, but Alyssa is going to sit there covering her eyes because she, I don't know why. I just imagine like a busting blue candle. I won't cover my eyes. I'll just be like, move on, move along, move along. Nothing to see here. I've got nothing to say. Help them find the clitoris. Oh my gosh, that's so funny. Yeah, so some of this questions about about anything and we'll pick as many as we can. We'll answer them on a show that'll come out, I believe first week in July. So look forward to that. So let's get to the things we're feeling petty about. I'll go first because this is something I think we all have things to weigh in on. So as Dana alluded to at the beginning of the last segment, there's always an article. Like every week there's like the article. Do you remember the bad art friend article? Oh yeah, I still think about bad art friend. I still think of the bad art for the, remember the, they wrote the cat person story. Oh yeah, being the article. And then they wrote the cat person story about me being the article. Yeah. And then there's always, you know, some article. There was a great one this week that I was like, this is going to be the article. And it was about a woman who was like the queen of the nimby's in California. But then it got upstaged by other like the articles. And this is the, this is the one that came out on Tuesday. So it was a little too late for our episode planning purposes, but it was on the cut. And I don't want to like pile on this writer because they're getting plenty on social media and stuff. I mean, look, all the tens of thousands of words I've written over the course of my writing career. I've gotten some shit wrong. And I've been real stupid about things in the past. And so everybody gets things wrong sometimes. So I want to, whatever, let's just focus on this specific piece instead of the writer herself. So there's a piece on the cut. Great publication. This piece is not good. Um, the piece is called canceled at 17. The article is the sad story of a teenage boy who one day found out that his name was on a list of people to look out for that was posted in the girl's bathroom at school. Uh, and, and this teenage boy, Diego was canceled as a result. Now let's talk about why he appeared on the list. Diego appeared on the list because when he was at a party, he showed his girlfriend's nudes to people without her permission. Um, so here's what I feel petty about this week. This seems pretty obvious, but like the article was written in a very sympathetic way to the boy. Not to the girl who had her nudes shown at a party. Uh, don't do that. That's what I feel petty about this week. Don't do that. The person you're supposed to feel, that is a good reason to be canceled. Like if a bad reason to be canceled is like, um, you know, something that is, is not true. Something that is, um, you know, like a decade in the past and you totally moved on and you've made amends, like this is a legitimate reason to be canceled for. You know what I got canceled for in eighth grade? I got canceled for wearing too much brown. Yeah, people get canceled for way stupider reasons in high school, showing nudes to people at a party. Can I weigh in here? Yes, of course. Okay, you guys. So according to any episode I've ever watched of Law and Order SVU, not just cancelable, criminal, it's fucking kitty porn. This is crazy. How is this even a thing? How can you defend it? It's like I was so confused by the article that was like, this seems pretty clearly like a crime. Justified. Yes. Yeah, uh, canceled by the law. Yeah, no, you just broke the law. You're going to jail. Oh my God. And can I also say I thought it was a really interesting story, like in the abstract about like the way social media has changed, you know, teenage interactions and the way that like, you know, power and information are sort of tied. But you didn't have to frame that story as a quote unquote cancellation, which is already like a loaded, weird term. You could just be like, this girl had this violation happen to her and this is the interesting way that her school responded and isn't, you know, isn't it different than when we were kids or whatever. But like framing it the way that it was framed was just baffling to me. Yeah. See, that's why I didn't want to like pile on the writer. I think that it might have also been an edit. I'm sorry. I mean, no. 20 months after he developed a crush, 18 months after he'd fallen in love, dot, dot, dot, dot, uh, Diego, who is enormously appealing. I'm sorry. No, the writer, she deserves some of the fucking Okay. I'm just trying to be generous. I'm trying to be like, okay, like, but yeah. Okay. Fair. Fair. Maybe I'm coming at this with a little bit of a bias, but that is a pretty big That's pretty bad. That's pretty bad. That's pretty bad. And it's like, she's like, oh, you know, poor him. He got canceled because he appeared on this list and so his friends canceled him. And I'm like, you know what? His friends should have canceled him when he showed them the pictures. Yeah. You know, like it's not because he made the list is because he fucking went around violating his girlfriend's or his crush's autonomy. Yeah. That's why he should be canceled. Yes. That's a good reason. More people should be canceled for that. That should be something cancellation should be a deterrent of antisocial behavior. Yes. Cancel people. Anyway, that's what I feel petty about this week. Okay, Alyssa, what are you feeling petty about this week? Okay, guys. I don't know if mine's it's like partial petty partial public service announcement. Okay. On Instagram stories. If you are posting a story, I need you to pay attention to your font size. Okay. Oh, because I can't enlarge it like I can do on Maine. And so it's like, if you're reposting us something from someone else, just take a minute. Use your thumbs, make it a little bit bigger. If you're typing something, think to myself, can anyone but me read this with my perfect 2020 vision? Because not even my bifocals can help me with half of your stories anymore. So that's what I want to say. Please make your ship bigger on IG stories because it is literally legible. Okay. No, there is very petty. Think of the bifocals, I guess. You guys look at these. They're so big and they still can't see half of what's on there. They should do like a magnifying like iPhone cover. So you can. Something. God, this is not been a good episode for me. Like I might as well get my cane out be like things are going downhill fast, you guys. I think, you know what? When I do get to cane age, I'm going to think of it as another accessory. It's going to be the baddest cane that ever was. My cane's going to look like this. Yes, exactly. And you can come up and we can just be like the golden girls and we can have all of our canes walking through town. So, Jalisa, you're going to have like a rock and roll McDonald's cane, essentially. Dana is going to be like a like a. I want like an old European. Yeah, she's got some noble blood type. Yeah, I want like a lion, you know, carving like a gargoyle. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You'll tell the children riddles, the all people are rich. And then when you die, the one that was the like feeble little boy who was the gentlest kindest one will understand that you were just explaining that there's a treasure map in the cane. Oh my God. All I want is to be to age into a witch. That's like I want a sassy London streak of gray hair. That's all I want. Yeah, I think that's that's a great goal. Dana, what are you feeling petty about this question? I know that like, you know, in theory, people have been wearing masks for like, hopefully two plus years at this point. But people have also forgotten how to cover when they sneeze and cough for some reason. And so I feel petty that whether you're wearing a mask or not, the polite thing to do when you sneeze or cough is turn away from who you're with and lift your elbow. I don't know if they haven't taught everyone this in school. They taught us this in elementary school. It is basic politeness. And when you're not wearing a mask, it's very important. I have seen people pull down their masks to sneeze and cough. Nightmare. Nightmare. Yeah, geez. I mean, I think we've all learned that it's the inside of the album now. Yeah, it's the inside of the album though. It's perfectly nose and mouth shaped. It fits really well. It's by design. It's one of the good, good design features in the human body. Yeah. There's so many bad ones and this is one of the good ones. I think cancel culture should exist for people who pull their mask down to sneeze. That is those people should be. Okay, that's a good thing to feel petty about. Uh, Julissa, bring us home. What do you feel petty about? All right. I love you all. I really do. But please stop asking me to do shit for free. Oh, oh, got it. I thought you were talking to me specifically. I was like, I was like, oh no. I was talking to the audience. I mean, and probably not hysteria listeners, but this is what I'm feeling petty about. It's like, I already do a lot of free things. You know, I visit a lot of classrooms for free. It's like a teacher's always reach out and they're like, can you please come to my classroom? I'm like, yes, I will zoom and answer your kids questions, which I love doing. But if you are part of a company and this is your DEI, uh, budget, like, do not ask me to do things for free. Like I make a living writing and speaking, like, how do you think I pay for my mortgage and my blinky water bottle? I need money. I am not generationally wealthy and my labor is valuable. And no, I cannot do your corporate thing for free. So stop asking me. No more free things. Yeah, I feel that. Why? Why do people think that like you get paid? Yeah. Yeah. I agree with you about the like teacher thing. Like if somebody asked me to come to a classroom for the most part, it's like, yes, they're buying their own markers. I'm not going to ask for a teacher to pay me for something. But I think that yes, the expectation that writers and speakers do things for free is a little annoying. I was on the church of Satan website the other day. I knew you'd bring it up at some point. Long story, because I want to start a Satan high school in Maine because a Supreme Court just said that Maine's law that excludes religious schools from being able to receive scholarships for students is unconstitutional. So I want to start a satanic high school in Maine. But first, there's several steps between me and Satan high school. I need to become a Satanist first. And I wanted to like figure out what that was about because I was like, is this going to be weird? Anyway, this has kind of pulled up. One of the things, look, Mark, one of the things the state and the church of Satan website, which by the way, different from satanic temple, which is the one that I was actually interested in, but whatever church of Satan website, very funny. If you like cantankerous tones and like kind of they refer to homes as layers. And there's this one thing that's like, please don't ask us to, we charge a membership fee because we're not altruists. We're Satanists. We want money. We need money to do things. And I was like, I feel that Satanists. I totally get it. Anyway, I was so tempted to change my IG bio. I do not do free things. You should. It's totally reasonable. Yeah, with like a little parentheses, it says, unless you are a teacher and you're buying your own supplies. Also, if you're a teacher at like a private school, like that has a ton of money, then like pay me. Like I can only do what I do because I get paid. Otherwise, I would have to go back to work on Wall Street. So if that's the future you all want for me. No, definitely not. He asked me to do shit for free. Keep Julissa off the Wall Street. Julissa, I got a good tip from somebody once, which I have not implemented, but they said to create your own assistant account. And then it makes it so much easier for you to say no because it's your assistant saying no. I realized I just said that on a podcast. I have an actual real assistant. Oh, shit. Oh, you fancy. And she does say no for me a lot. But then I feel bad because she's like, they keep asking and I've already said no. And I'm like, that's a personal problem. I was like, stop responding. Just don't respond. Oh my god. Okay. So you heard it here. Hopefully last because she shouldn't have to repeat herself. Do not ask Julissa to do things for free unless you are somebody who is working in public schools and really could use a free gig from Julissa. That's but that's the only thing that you should ask her to do for free. Okay. Dana and Julissa, thank you so much for coming by today. Thank you. Alissa, thank you for being my writer.
