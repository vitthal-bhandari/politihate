Now, I've been honored to get to know him over the past several years, and much of what he has shared regarding men and masculinity has shaped my own personal perspective of how we are to show up as fathers and husbands and leaders in our business and community. Today, we talk about his latest book, Fire in the Dark. We also do a deep dive into the roles of masculinity, individual responsibility, the heroic ideal, and ultimately why we as men look to the gods and what we can learn from them. You're a man of action. You live life to the fullest. Embrace your fears and boldly charge your own path. When life knocks you down, you get back up one more time, every time. You are not easily deterred or defeated, rugged, resilient, strong. This is your life. This is who you are. This is who you will become. At the end of the day, and after all is said and done, you can call yourself a man. Gentlemen, what is going on today? My name is Ryan Mickler, and I am the host and founder of this podcast, and we want to welcome you here and welcome you back. We are doing great things. We've got good things in the works. We've got our exclusive Brotherhood, the Iron Council. We've got our new battle planning app. We've formed partnerships and alliances with great organizations and companies. We've got our exclusive Brotherhood, the Iron Council. I'm just blown away with how quickly we've been growing, and that's a testament to you sharing this work, putting it out there, making it visible, banning with us, and believing in what it is we do, which is to reclaim and restore masculinity in this degenerate, broken down society. Culture is deteriorating around us, and it's up to us as men, fathers, husbands, business owners, community leaders, strong, noble, courageous, capable men to write the ship as it continues to deviate and go off course. So, we're doing that today. I've got a conversation with the one and only Jack Donovan. I'm going to introduce you to him in just a minute, but before I do, I want to make a mention of my friends over at Warrior Poet Society. They've got a new network that, if I were to describe it very quickly, I would say almost a Netflix for men. You're going to have all kinds of topics from an exclusive show from me with Order of Man to other tactical trainings, firearms training, fitness. I mean, you name it. If it's a topic that's interesting to you, you can check it out at Warrior Poet Society Network. So, if you go to orderamand.com slash WPSN, orderamand.com slash WPSN, and you can use the code order, or D-E-R-E check out for a 10% discount. Again, that's orderamand.com slash WPSN. All right, guys. Let me introduce you to my guest today. A lot of you guys already know. Of course, who he is. His name is Jack Donovan. And fortunately, I've been able to get to know Jack over the past several years. And we've spent a lot of time via Zoom, even face-to-face talking about masculinity and what it actually means to be a man. Now, I was introduced to his work years ago when I read his book, The Way of Man. And since then, I've been fascinated with his interesting and unique perspectives and his willingness to share what has only increasingly become polarizing thoughts and ideas about masculinity. He's an extremely fascinating man and has really caused me to take a hard look at what I perceive as the responsibilities of men and what it means to be a man and how we can and should show up in the world. So I enjoy the conversation, as I always do with my friend Jack. I know you guys are really going to enjoy this one as well. Jack, what's up, brother? I think we're on officially, I mean, we've had plenty of conversations, but I think officially we're on, is this round three? Three or four that you've been on the podcast? Three or four? Yeah, somewhere in there. Anyway, it's always good to talk with you, man. It's always funny because every time I have a conversation with you, because I'm a Christian, a lot of guys will bring that up. Well, you know, he's this and he's a man. He's this and he's that and he's a pagan. He doesn't believe this and he doesn't believe that as if, because I'm a Christian, I'm not allowed to have additional conversations outside of the realm of Christianity. It's a very interesting concept to me. It is weird. And it's not, I mean, obviously, I mean, we're talking about the new book and that was one thing that I dealt with when I was writing it, because I could have written a niche book for a pagan audience. But the guys I want to talk to are such a bigger group of guys. And I didn't want to be limited by that. I wanted to be, you know, I have so many, the older I get, I just want to be surrounded by awesome guys who are doing awesome things and not be like, well, what do you believe about this? I mean, there's certain things that are like breaking points for me, especially, you know, over the past like years, but, you know, I want to be around guys who are trying to be excellent all the time. And, you know, I like thank you for having me on this show. I definitely, I want to compliment you on what you've been doing all these years. You know, I've been writing in the Manus field or about men's issues for, you know, about a decade, a little bit more. And I remember when it was just a got a bunch of guys writing angry blogs, you know, who were a little broken and whatever. You know, you're really bringing a lot of things into almost really the mainstream, which was not happening. I mean, well, you just had a congressman on your show the other day, you know, which is pretty amazing. And that's what needs to happen if any change is going to happen. You know, it needs to be broader people. Yeah. Yeah, it's funny that you talk about the quote unquote, man, I actually don't like that term. It exists. Yeah. It's there. And I think labels serve their purposes in that we can, we can roughly assume what that person is about. But when I hear the label, Manosphere, you're exactly right. I hear things like broken individuals. Essentially, when I hear Manosphere, what I think of is guys who are basically the equivalent of Third Wave feminist for masculinity. They're so broken. They're so hurt. They can't mature. They can't fix themselves. And it's somebody else's fault. They're victims. And somebody else did something to them and screw society and screw everybody else in general. Yeah, that's what I think that's what it was. I would say, you know, maybe in 2012 when the man came out or like 2014 or all that. That's the way it was. And I think there has been a big change. You know, you have like Tanner speaking at like Manosphere events. He's talking about like productive families and all that kind of stuff. So that kind of stuff is just changing a lot. And it's good to see it. You know, it is good. And I've also seen it develop and mature. And this might just come from the guys who, you know, 10 years ago, we're talking about how to pick up chicks to now their dads. And now their husbands and now their business owners. They're leading their community. And they're like, maybe picking up chicks isn't the ultimate goal. And let's change this idea of the quote unquote Manosphere to adding value and enhancing the lives of the people that we care about, whatever that looks like for you. Yeah. And that's, you know, for the individual wise, he matures too. I always say that, you know, there was a big discussion in the Manosphere about like moving away from that as well. And I was like, well, there is an ever evergreen crop of young men who need to figure things things out about women. And so that's always there. That's going to be there's a new group of 18 year olds every year that need to figure that stuff out. But obviously that if they stay there forever and they're, you know, I mean, we can't all be damblesarian. You know, that's the life at times I'm thinking, you know, maybe there's something to that. I don't know about this. He's definitely the Lord of the earth. I don't know. I mean, I mean, I think about, you know, you look at that and I kind of equate it to this. Maybe it's a weird metaphor. Maybe it's not a great metaphor. But, you know, you think about a video game that you're playing and you play, try to to gather all the resources and the new tools and the new skill set. If you have all the cheat codes, it's cool for like an hour. And then it sucks. You know, for me, I look at my life and I've been married for nearly 17 years now. I've got four kids. We've got mortgages. We've got a business. We've got this and we've got that. All these things that, you know, quote unquote, we're supposed to have at this point. And it's challenging. It's difficult. But it's the challenge that makes it meaningful and significant to me. And as much as, you know, sometimes being single and not having kids is, you know, sounds pretty appealing at times. Sure. There's also a tremendous sense of value that I think is void in that type of life. And maybe that's just the level of maturity on my part. Yeah. Yeah. And also, I mean, there are going to be different strokes for different folks. You know, like different guys need different things and different things are to work out. I mean, I went through a period a few years ago. I'm like, kids, how can I make that happen? You know, like, I definitely had a moment with it. I don't think that's what I do or what I'm really here to do in the world. But I don't think that would have been a smart move. He would have backfired. What makes you say that? Well, I mean, I do have another relationship that I've been for 23 years. So there's that. I'm a little, my life is a little more subtle than people think it is in a lot of ways. But, you know, that that would have required. A very non-traditional arrangement to do something very traditional. And I don't really, I don't think that that's really how I would have wanted to do it. You know, so it just, it just wasn't the right choice for me. I decided. And I think. And also, I'm in a weird, I'm a weird artist too. I need to be in my own head and not worry. You know, I, I rented this office so that I could not be not new work at my house. So, I get to walk around and talk to myself and be a weirdo and make like I'm working on music. I don't even know why right now. I'm like learning teaching myself music production. You know, I need to do stuff like that. And that's kind of who I am. So, you know, it's, it's, there are a lot of guys who I think. And this is a something that. You know, it has to be addressed as well as in, you know, the man conversation. Let's say that it's happening all around the world. Is that there are going to be a lot of guys who are going to end up being single for a lot for most of their lives in whatever we that way that means whether they're single and don't have kids or single and divorced or single and. You know, in various relationships at different times, you know, not just like playing the field every day because sure that is that that is going to get sad for anybody. I think by the time you're, you know, if you're doing that for 20, 30 years, but you know, the guys have long term relationships and whatever and they go move through them and different things and. You know, not. There's a limited number of women who want to have traditional marriage marriages. Right. And I think that's increasing actually. So I assume I should say it's decreasing that traditional concept of marriage and monogamy, etc. Yeah, yeah, I mean, that's and while I think, you know, it's having a little bit of a renaissance in some people's mind as far as coming back and be like, Hey, maybe this wasn't such a bad idea after all. And but there's still, you know, I like less available women who are going to be interested in that world. So I mean, there's certain groups of people who are going to fit into that better and certain who aren't. So I think that there's just a lot of different groups and a lot of, I always say different voices for different years. And, you know, there's, you know, as long as you're helping these guys live positive and productive lives in whatever way that means. I think that that's, that's, yeah. Did you ever read the book, Manhood in the Making? Have you ever read that book? I'll buy by David Gilmore, I believe it's by. Yes. Yeah, I think we actually talked about it so we did. That's right. You caught, I got mad because I thought someone was ripping me off and it realized that I had ripped them off. I forgot about that. Yeah, I, that was on your, one of your threads because it was a source that I had used like in 2007 and I forgot about it. Right. And then, and then you had the guy who was in one of the essays, I think, in that book. Yes. He wrote it. David Gilmore. Yeah, it was David Gilmore. I think it was like another Harvard academic. Maybe. I can't remember. It was something about that. Yeah. But he, I remember that. Being good at being a man versus being good at being a man versus being a good man. Being a good man. He had, he had said that kind of impassing and whatever and then I developed it later. Right. Something important. But, uh, I think that, yeah, that was where I originally had gotten that distinction from, but it was like years after the fact. I always get, so whenever I forgot about that, now you say that, but when, whenever I talk about that, I always give credit because I saw it there and then I give credit to you at first as well because you developed that. But the reason you articulated it, what I mean is, is you explored it, you, you dive deeper into it. But the reason I brought that book up is because in, in the book, he talks about, uh, the role of men is being a protector, a provider and a pro creator. I actually disagree with that because I see a lot of men out there who I would consider masculine mature men who are adding value to themselves, their families, their community society that for whatever reason, they, they have either decided not to, or physically cannot procreate. And I just don't think that makes them less of a man. And what I'm suggesting is that fatherhood doesn't define masculinity. But I do believe father, maybe a father figure, meaning that you can serve other men, you can groom other men, you can help them develop. But that doesn't mean it has to be your biological son, necessarily. Yeah. And, and, you know, this is my, my dude is George Washington right now. And he actually never had kids. He actually had some foster children and whatever, you know, they took in and he was a father figure for an entire country. You know, so that is also a role. And I think that he's an interesting way that you could look at that for guys who don't end up having kids. You know, like you can do a lot. And you can be a, and you know, I see myself at this point. I mean, I'm, I'm not a young guy. You know, I'm 46 and I've been around a little bit. And, uh, you know, I see guys doing things. And I'm like, you really shouldn't do that, man. You're going to regret that. You know, like, you know, you can be a little bit more of a voice of moderation on certain things where you're like, that's going to lead you down a bad path that you don't want to go to. And mostly it's because you and I have both have done a bunch of dumb shit in our lives. And, and we've realized like, okay, yeah, I actually did that 15 years ago. Yeah. That didn't work out for me. So you better get, but it's interesting because I see society as a whole buck the idea. And I think this is really the premise. There's a lot of things about your book, but really the premise of the book is society rejects the idea of like what you should and shouldn't do. And to me, I think about the timeless principles that we turn to in mythology, our religions, where regardless of how you feel from a spiritual perspective, there is some eternal truth to the way that we quote unquote should be behaving that will actually serve us very well if we adhere to it. Yeah, there was a, there's a big problem that happened in modernity, which is basically, which came from science, although it's not science's fault. You know, the idea that anything that we can't measure or find evidence for at a given time, even if it's traditional wisdom and is not valid. And we should throw it out with a baby with the bath water because we can't measure it yet. Right. I mean, because that was a big thing, you know, in studying feminism and studying like gender and stuff for years. They couldn't figure out what about men and women was so different. And now they have done more brain studies and hormonal studies and they actually have more data than they had in the 60s and 70s. But they did some people went to some islands and they're like, these people don't seem to care about the same things we care about. Therefore, all these things are socially constructed. And that's not really true. And what we're finding in whether it's dating or marriage or all these things in societies that there are certain things that maybe work out better because, and people have been doing them for thousands of years, not because they just didn't know any better, but because they had tried other things and they didn't work as well. So one of the things I said a minute. Of course. Yeah. And I talk about this. Here's the framework I use is that masculinity, femininity, these are biologically constructed dynamics, right? Like men and women are different. We know that anecdotally, scientifically, we know that. Okay, it's not a question. Right. So we have these biological constructs and then they're supported societally because they work. Right. So society says, Oh, yeah, the men are bigger, stronger and faster. So we need them to defend the village. Yeah. That's a societal support of a biological construct. But people seem to get that backwards. Yeah. Well, it's a rational division of labor. Right. You know, like, have higher the best person for the best job. You know, like the most skilled person and also there's other biological realities that go into that. Well, you need the women to have children and they can't do the hunting and fighting if they're having children because they need to be doing the children because someone needs to do that job. And we need to protect the women because they're a resource. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I mean, all these things are basic, but we were living this weird socially constructed time where, like they said, they threw the baby out with bathwater and now we're seeing, we're seeing ideas from the 60s and 70s being written into law now. And the idea that like, you know, us saying men and women are different is actually very contentious right now, which is strange. We have all the data and everything. We have more than we had then. But because we're seeing the people who are promoting these philosophies come of age and come into power as much as anything, you know, like a lot of these just gender theory stuff. I guess I got to see a lot of it early because I went to art school in New York City in the early 90s. And the art school I went to was actually a division for the new School of Social Research. So I learned how at a very young age, how to draw a line on a canvas and make it about social class disparity. All sorts of weird formulations that don't really match up. Yeah, yeah, but I mean, that's how you get an A. And that's what people have been taught for a long time. And so like that's, and at the time I didn't know any better and hadn't really explored all those ideas. But, you know, like you find out how you can write writes a description of a piece of art that you made that plays into some ideas about gender constructed gender and challenging that idea and all that kind of stuff. And I was doing that in 1994 or whatever. So, you know, I saw a lot of this stuff coming way before. I think a lot of guys, when I started writing about this, a lot of guys were like, what's all that about? I don't have to deal with that. You know, like radical feminists or whatever. We're just in some faraway place that they didn't have to deal with. And now everyone has to deal with it. And so it's become a thing that's, you know, mainstream and a problem that no man can really get away from. It's an interesting point. I'm sure you're familiar with logical fallacies and ad hominem attacks and things like this, right? And one thing that's been traditionally painted as a logical fallacy is the slippery slope fallacy. Yes. Where, you know, oh, well, you know, you're projecting out into the future what might be, but that's a fallacy because that's not what is. And yet what you're explaining right now is a slippery slope. You know, you have a bunch of teenagers or early twenties going into these schools, learning these concepts, trying to get their A's, but also being frankly indoctrinated into this ideology. And now these are individuals who are CEOs. They're running for office. And now they're legislating based on what they learned 20, 30, 40 years ago. Absolutely. And, you know, the slippery slope thing, that wasn't necessarily destined to happen. It didn't have to happen, but you could see how it would. Right. And now it has, you know, something could have affected, you know, changed things along the way because that's the way slippery slopes work. You know, it's like, it does. It's not necessarily going to go there, but it looks like there's a strong possibility. Well, I think about that, even with something as silly as, you know, it being winter here in Maine and you got the driveway that's iced over. I mean, I don't have to slip on the ice. It's a stronger likelihood that I might because it's icy and slippery, but I could watch my step and be a little bit aware of my footing and actually get to my truck without slipping. But the odds are increased because it's slippery. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. And what's really happened and what I'm seeing more and more that people aren't really seeing. They're just becoming aware of it now is that because we really let all those people take all take over the culture. You know, they run all the magazines. Like there, there's no print media about any of us. Anybody really anything positive about masculine doesn't exist. Do you think people would care if we, I mean, look, I guess people care because both you and I are very successful in our own right. Yeah. But do you think if we were to create some sort of traditional media outlet or a magazine or a book or whatever that it actually could compete with some of these. I've heard the term legacy media. I'm not sure if I completely like that term, but I think we understand the point, the concept of legacy media. What are your thoughts with that? Well, I think that it wouldn't be a matter of, I mean, you're not going to jump on a new stands and airports. It's like tomorrow. Right. Of course. But I do think that that needs to exist because otherwise there is no counter. And so, you know, legacy media exists because it was, it's been around for, I mean, how long has the New York Times been around? Right. Yeah. You know, I mean, how many of us staff do they have? How much money they have? All these things take time. And so no, I don't think, and we live in a different era now. I don't know if you need to put out a printed magazine every month to make an impact in the world in the same way that you would have before. But, you know, hold my beer, maybe I'm working on that. So, are you announcing something right here? Like we got to know, man. Are you making an announcement? I don't know what I have to talk about. Somebody I'm working with on this project. But no, we could, I think that there needs to be more than one too. There needs to be a lot of print media because basically what is what is vanity fair or a lot of these mainstream magazines, whatever there. There are people with the same viewpoint congratulating each other for doing well. Like, yeah, I mean, I call it a big circle jerk. Right. I mean, that's really what it is. I mean, it was kind of, but, but at the same time, I mean, you're, they're doing it in a very sophisticated way and you're getting like high end kind of literature and interviews and whatever out of that and, and, and that's that creates this track record. You know, that we don't, that we don't have. I think that, you know, because I was talking about men's magazines a while back and really the men's magazines now are like what recoil, you know, like, like, I mean, look at things like men's health and men's fitness. I think it's not a men's magazine. No, no, they're not written for men in any way that we would understand the definition. And it's like they're, they're not even written for normal gay men. They're, they're written like the things you see on the cover and whatever. It's very urban and it's a very small population. They're really written for it. I think it's this, maybe they're lost leaders for some bigger company or something. What do you, so look, all right, let's talk about, let's talk about gay men because you bring it up. Like, so you say it's not written for gay men. But I think the stereotype is that it is actually, and I would like you to talk about that. Yeah. Well, I mean, I mean, regular gay men don't wear dresses. Yeah, good point. Good point. And I must suggest to me, too, for sure. They really aren't. I mean, most of those guys are like wearing jeans and t-shirts like everybody else and going to bars and they, you know, they're just trying to get laid and to live their lives. They aren't really all that. Like, that's a very small group with even in that population. Sure. Yeah, makes sense. Fashion, whatever. I mean, those guys, I mean, those guys are like, we're going to baristas somewhere. We believe that because it's perpetuated on TV. You know, so I'll give you an example. Sure. My wife and I have started watching this show, Shit's Creek. And I don't know if you've seen it, but the sun is a very flamboyant, obviously feminine gay man. And so that's what we see. And so that's what we believe. And that's always been the thing. And I wrote about that years ago, but it's that's obviously that they're the ones said in the big signals. If some dude's acting normal, you don't know it. Yeah, you know, that's he's blending in. He's blending in. And, you know, there is definitely a bigger percentage in that community of that way of behavior. Sure. And it's part of the stereotype. It's like, if you've, if you've signed up for that, now that's who I have to become. It's part of the package identity. That and so there's a performative aspect there. They change their language and certain things that when they become part of that community, you know, you hang out with, if I go hang out with hunting dudes, they're going to pick up their turns of phrase. So look, I'm so glad you brought that up because look, we're going to talk about the disparity between, and again, I'm speaking in generalities, the homosexual community, for example, and the hunting community, which I don't think generally you would associate with that with the homosexual community generally. Okay. So you use the term performative aspect. I believe that's right. Whatever community you belong to. Oh, yeah. If you're, if you're part of the homosexual community, the hunter community, the cross fit community, the, the, the body positive movement, the vegan community, pick a community. You get to exactly another good point. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Or, or, or I've talked about it. Guys are here, sick of hearing it building a canoe. It's like, okay, well, there's a community of woodworkers. Right. So, right. And there is a performative aspect. One thing that you've talked about that I really, really appreciate. And you actually checked me on this years ago. Is you said it isn't disingenuous. And I'm paraphrasing here. So I want you to clarify. But it isn't disingenuous to work on making yourself more. So some people perceive it as performative. And yet I think you make the case of, no, I'm actually just trying to be the best version of that individual who I want myself to be. Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. Everybody, everybody wants to make it, you know, because there's this value is such with being authentically whoever you are and unchanged in some way like you. Right. You just arrived. And that's who you are. And anyone who has really improved their lives in any way or made themselves better has had to work on it. You know, I mean, people look at like old things of me and they're like, oh, you're like, I'm faking now because I'm different. You're like, no, I said, hey, you could change who you are. And I did. And right. And people have talked about like my voice. I have a narrator voice that I use for different things. And now it's actually just a bigger part of my voice. It's not always, I mean, obviously I go all over the place and I'm, you know, if I'm going to be happy to party, I'm talking different way that I'm talking, you know, what I'm doing. Jacked out of a narrative voice. And so, you know, but it is, that is my voice has changed from doing that for long enough. That's become part of who I am. And I liked it that way. And that was the goal. You know, so it should be that, right? I mean, I have aspiration has changed. And that changes who you are. And that's a big thing that I've talked, and I'm sure you've experienced that with worth working out and with Jiu Jitsu and everything when you, when you are putting yourself through any kind of physical trial with, you know, grappling and so forth, you're fighting other men all the time. And that changes how you perceive yourself and them and, and whatever that changes who you are. And that's why I think that it's so important for men to do those kinds of things because they, it changes, it changes them. And it's good. And one of the things that I said, I've said it a few times recently, it's happened to me because if you would have asked me if I was when I was 27 years old, if I thought of myself as being strong, like physically strong. I'd be like, I guess I'm kind of strong. I don't know. Sure. Right. And now it's like a weird characteristic that people associate me with me that I like I've had to get used to because I got a lot stronger over a lot of years. And we were doing something in Jiu Jitsu, where there was this like 17 year old and I, he was trying to arm bar. I mean, I just lifted his whole body up. And, you know, and I got kind of in trouble for it because the coach was like, you should escape from that technically he's small. Yeah, the point is not to be strong. It's to be technical. Right. I was just laughing. I was here because I just think it's funny that I can. And I had to think about it. But like, am I a bully now? Like, when did that happen? You know, like, am I a bully? You know, and that's just because my body has changed and my aptitudes have changed. And so you just, it changes who you are in all kinds of different ways. And so that now, yeah, I, I, I'm a pretty strong guy for my size. And people comment on it all the time. And so it's just part of who I am. And that wasn't part of who I was before. But it comes from challenging yourself and changing, you know, like pushing your boundaries. You know, like, I'm sure you have a million things that you've done over the past few years that you're like, Oh, I can do that now. I mean, the same with narrating a book. I mean, or doing podcast or public speaking or anything that you have to do. All that stuff was fake until you make it. But it's weird because people will say that, and here's one of the things I get. Not a lot, but, you know, there's a fringe of people who say things like, Oh, you're compensating. You're over. And in a way, you know what, they're right. Because that's actually true. Like, I didn't consider myself good enough at whatever it is you're addressing right now. And so I'm compensating by shoring up my weaknesses. You're pointing it out as some sort of deficiency or flaw or negative thing. And I look at it and think, Yeah, you're right. I wasn't good enough at whatever. And so now I'm practicing whatever. Let's take you jitsu so that I can be more competent. Yes, I'm compensating. But that doesn't make me disingenuous. Right. Yeah, I mean, if you, if you, it's like, anytime you realize a weakness in yourself and try to fix it, you're over compensating. Yes. I recognize the weakness. Therefore, I have to work on it. Therefore, I'm over compensating. And you do a little bit, and this happens with masculinity and all kinds of things and everything else. There is a little bit of a pendulum like you, you may be overshoot a little bit where you needed to be. And then you become a little bit more confident and you settle in something that looks a little more comfortable. I mean, I would say I have to overshoot. You have to. I would say that with my early narration, like it's a little bit like my first book that I narrated was a little bit like overly loud. And it went a little big with it. And now it's, I can find a comfortable like place with it because I've been doing it for so long. And, you know, you have to feel out where the far end of it is and then find where it's comfortable and feels right. I think a lot of men are afraid of the perception. If I try quote unquote too hard, you're talking about narration. Oh, well, you know, if I do that, what will people think of me? Or if I go to jujitsu, what will people think? Or if I do this thing or that thing, people will accuse me or point fingers or laugh or poke or whatever it is that they do. And so they just don't at all. They just settle for mediocrity and then they try to justify to themselves. Well, you know, the reason I don't work out is because I'm happy with how I am. And that's a huge lie. And people know it's a lie and it's destructive. It's damaging to their own psyche and well being. Yeah. Well, people know it's a lie, but they'll get enough affirmation for saying it from other people who feel the same way. So it becomes very comfortable. There'll be a ton of other people around them who also are afraid to go try something new and then just won't accept who they are. And so there's this big affirmation cycle that a lot of people get in because people wouldn't do it if everyone was like, shut up your full of it. Which I think more people should say like, screw off, like, don't be happy with being fat. Like, and people say, well, that's, that's your, your, your fat shaming or your, your phobic of something. It's like, no, I just think people should actually strive to not be fat and instead be more physically fit. I'm not afraid of that. I just think it'll be better for people. Yeah. And, you know, that's, you know, as I finished up doing the audio book of this book the other day. That's one of my favorite parts at the end of the book where I talk about, I mean, there's certain, you know, truths that are self evident that have always been men have always recognized that transcend religion and transcend different cultures and whatever it's like, we've always thought it was better to be beautiful and it is to be ugly and better to be smart than it is to be dumb and better to be strong than it is to be weak and better be courageous than it is to be afraid. And, you know, obviously, you know, the person who can't move around because, you know, I've been heavier and lighter in my life and I can tell you just 15 pounds away from where I am right now is a huge difference in my capability. You know, like as far as me being just getting tired and just getting tired and being uncomfortable. Right. And, you can tell me that you're comfortable like that all you want, but if you're walking around at 260 and you're my size, that is not comfortable. It's not you have no idea like how much that hurts. And if you've always been that way, maybe you don't realize what health even is. You know, like, you've diluted yourself a little bit for sure. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, because how could you sleep at night if you didn't? Like, if you know, for example, look, I've been 50 pounds overweight more than I was today. And I remember a cathartic moment for me. I went into the gym and I picked up a 45 pound plate and I'm like, no wonder I was tired all the time. I, a 45 pound plate is not insignificant. That's a heavy chunk of weight. And so I'm picking this up. I'm like, holy cow. This was at night. This was wrapped around my neck. Yeah. This was wrapped around my lungs. And no wonder I was snoring and I had restless legs syndrome and I was uncomfortable and I couldn't sleep and I was exhausted because I was carrying this around every day, all day, even into my sleep for my entire life. What a horrible position to be in. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's, as it said, that should be self-evident. Yeah. Like to most people like that looks uncomfortable. I mean, I always people, I always see people like try to run when they're really heavy to lose weight. I'm like, that's got to hurt. Like I've tried to run heavy and I wouldn't start there. We're doing pullups. Yeah. Right. But I mean, look, I come in. Look, I'm not going to judge it. Look, I see, I see obese individuals in the gym. And I think that's awesome. Excellent. No. Yeah. Because that person is trying to improve themselves. Yeah. They're always afraid that people are judging them and maybe somebody who has a really bad. Of course, there's always an a-holes are. But yeah, when I see people like that, I'm like, well, would you rather than be there McDonald's? Exactly. They need to be at the gym. That's where they should be. And so that's, they're working on a problem rather than just not working on a problem. I think what people run into a lottery that they run into or they tell themselves is that those pursuits are more about vanity than they are functionality or feeling good about yourself. For example, I've been broke in my life and I've also been in a position where, you know, we're relatively wealthy and we can take care of our finances and mortgages and buy the things that we want to go on the vacations and whatnot. Right? And I'll hear people say things like, well, you know, I care about my kids too much to like worry about pursuing my career and building wealth. It's like, yeah. Well, okay. I can appreciate that. You're presenting a false dichotomy here though and saying that you can either be wealthy or care about your kids. There's a third and an infinite number of options where you can actually build wealth and still be an extremely successful father figure, husband, patriarch of your home, et cetera. All right, men. Let me take a quick pause on the conversation really, really quickly. I think most of us pride ourselves in being prepared to deal with whatever life has to offer us. After all, it was Douglas Wilson who said, the real man gains renown by standing between his family and destruction, absorbing the blows of fate with equanimity. And the question remains, are you really prepared for what may come your way? And that's the question that we're working to answer this month in our exclusive brotherhood, the Iron Council. We're going to be discussing and challenging each other to focus on the priorities of preparedness, showing up our weaknesses and basically just holding each other accountable to put ourselves and our families in a better position should disaster strike. And on top of all that, you're going to get the accountability and guidance and direction when you've been with us inside of the Iron Council. So to get prepared for whatever life may have to throw at you and unlock access to the accountability needed to thrive, you can learn more and join us at orderamand.com slash Iron Council. Again, that's orderamand.com slash Iron Council. Do that right after the show. For now, let's get back to Jack. Yeah, I mean, in fact, you could be more successful. I mean, there's that big. There's that idea that this old kind of 1950s or 80s or whatever thing that comes around where like the successful man never sees his children and he's always far away and there's songs about it and all that kind of stuff and figure it with that popular one from like the 70s or 80s is. But we're dad becomes some just becomes just like his dad and then, you know, whatever, but there is that idea, but I think the other is happy medium. And obviously you have a lot more to give your kids if you have more money and and and as we've learned over the past year, especially money is freedom. It has a lot to do. I mean, I was lucky enough that I could read the space and that I can have guys over here to roll when I thought maybe the gym is might all close down. You know, like, oh, I can go do that. You can or you can build a home gym where you can do. There's a lot of things that you can do that you can't do if you're poor. And man, I was I was glad that I've I've been a delivery guy making like no money. Really for most of my life, I made about the exact same amount of money for years and years and years. And, you know, I've only been self employed for better than five years, five, six years, something like that. And yeah, I mean, man, that would have hit me hard. You know, when I had nothing in the bank, really, and like, you know, no cushion, no anything, you would have been desperate. I would have been desperate. Definitely. And then a lot of people are in that situations too. I mean, I'm just lucky that I was not, you know, at that point. I don't know if you're lucky or I mean, let's let's not let's not gloss over fortunate events, but you've also created it for yourself too. Yeah, I mean, I've definitely made some smart choices that I'm proud of. But, you know, I mean, there was a lot of years where I was equally smart. I just didn't figure it out yet. Good point. The guys who have a lot of potential and they're just not there. Yeah. You know, like at 25, I wasn't there. And so it's like, that's the luck of it is like, when when stuff happens to you in life, right? Right. Well, and you said, you said something interesting that I don't know if I totally agree with you said, wealth is or money is free to me. I mean, I said something like that. I think it can represent that. But I also think if you become so fixated and addicted to the wealth proportion of it without what it represents that it actually can be a self and pose shackles. Because if all you're chasing is the dollar or the zeros in your bank account, then are you really presenting and giving yourself freedom or are you just shackling yourself to chasing that endeavor or that pursuit? Yeah. No, I agree. I mean, there's, I mean, I look at, I definitely look at money as freedom because I just want to have enough money to do the stuff I want. You know, I just want to have to work on cool projects and do the stuff I want. And that's that's, but yeah, no, some guys are really become obsessed with money itself. And I wish maybe I was a little bit more that way because I would make more money because there is a thing like, if you're super into making money, you get excited by it. And you're good at things that you get excited about to a certain extent. And so guys who are really into making money, you know, have that going for them that, you know, I don't root. I'm like, I'm being fine. This is cool. Like I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm at, you know, like I'm satisfied where I'm at. But, you know, so there's a happy medium, I think there, you know, with that. But definitely yet, if you think about nothing else but money and obviously status, like status purchases and things like that. There's certain people who get fixated on that kind of thing. And then, you know, then you're buying things you can't really afford. Right. You know, I'm working to afford the thing. I mean, it's that fight club thing like by, you know, to buy things we don't even need, you know, right. Well, there's status purchases, but then there's also status signaling and status virtues like, you know, I'm more, I'm more honorable than you. Right. I care more about the animals than you. And so you're inferior to me or, you know, I care about gun legislation because I don't want to see people die. And so that makes me, that makes me superior to you or I care about open borders because, you know, I care about people and you don't. And so these are status, status signaling versus status purchases. Right. Well, it's really easy to gain status by having a feeling. I mean, that's what that is demonstrating a feeling. All the things that you've worked for that, you know, would theoretically make you better than me or more accomplished. But I have a feeling that's better than your feeling. Therefore, I become, I mean, that's an easy, easy way to make you feel like you're better than somebody, you know. Yeah, you don't actually have to accomplish anything to have a feeling. That's so. Yeah, I mean, everybody has them. Yeah. Like, like, that isn't something unique to you. We all have a feeling about things positive or negative. Yeah, it's like, I feel very strongly about many things. That doesn't mean my opinion really even matters sometimes. But I think that's actually one of the problems of social media. I love social media because it's afforded me the opportunities that you and I have to talk and, and us to build this movement and you as well to build your movement. And share your ideas. But, you know, one of the problems is that we've given everybody a voice and they begin to believe that their voice is relevant or equal or superior or just as good as anybody else. And look, the fact of the matter is some opinions matter and some actually don't or they carry less weight than others. Yeah, yeah, I mean, it's, you know, it's, you know, it's like the cliche. It's like if you do anything athletic online, there's a million people who have an opinion, but most of them don't know what they're talking about. Right. Like, you know, like it's, you know, it's whether it's someone coaching a still from a just to like, like, I had a posted a picture of me rolling with somebody and you get people coaching it. I'm like, it's a, you should have done this. You should have done that. Like it's a steal of like within within. I took 3000 pictures that day. That was a steal. But, you know, and we get the same thing with lifting or anything like that. You always get some guy who's 18 and read three blogs about it and is telling you what to do. And the absurdity of that was, I mean, when I used to hang out with this professional power lifter, you know, who was like a 900 pound squatter and he was always having people telling me to know how to squander and like, you know, and like, who are you like that. And that's one of the bad things about the democratic ideal, I think, is that it created the sense that everybody's opinion is always equal. Like, and that's not necessarily what I think the founders really meant. But it's very American, I think, even more than anything else. It's like people even say, you know, just comments on the internet. Right. Everybody has, everybody's opinion. People hate it when you close down comments. And I'm like, I don't need comments on this. And you don't, I always say, and this is just me from being on the internet for a long time. Like, I don't have to provide a platform for you to insult me. You're free to do that. Like in some other way, create your own platform to do that. But I don't have to like provide the space for you to do it. Right. That's like you're coming into my house and insulting me. And I'm like, I'm not doing that. Yeah. And here, welcome, come in and stay here and insult me and my family and put us at risk and threaten us. Sure, sure, sure. Yeah. Come on in. Nobody would ever do that. Yeah. No, thank you. Not going to do it. Well, I think when you take this concept of freedom and freedom of speech and the right to say things, if you don't marry that and couple that with individual responsibility, that's where we run into issues. So, you know, for example, I have an individual responsibility to listen to you and other people that might conflict with your ideas. And then it's my responsibility as an individual and a leader of my family and friends and colleagues and people who follow along to then discern. Okay. Is Jack right here or is Joe right or maybe Jack's partially right and maybe Joe's partially right. But it's an individual responsibility for me to discern that information, not just to assume that both you and Joe are equal in whatever your thoughts or perspectives are. But we've absolved personal responsibility, right? It's not, oh, no, it's not the individual is Jack, it's your fault. If you're saying the wrong thing, that's your fault. No, it's the person who's trying to decipher that information or not whose responsibility it actually is. Yeah, yeah. I mean, that's, you know, obviously, you can incite them to whatever, you know, and then, and then it absolves them over responsibility for their actions. Yeah. What's your take on? I know we haven't talked a lot about the book because, I mean, every time we have a conversation, I love it when we go a thousand different directions. But one of the things you talk about is, is the concept of religion versus spirituality. And, and, and I'm always curious about that because I am both a, I would consider myself a spiritual and a religious person. And I'm really interested in your perspective on the differences and the values of, of each spirituality and religion. Whether religion, generally speaking, is an established form. You're doing something that's, that's been repeated. Actually, ritual, I think the original Latin goes to mean the writer proven way. So it's something that's been tested and you, we do it a certain way all the time. Right. And that's the way most churches are and so forth. And so there's a certain way that you do things and there's certain establishment and structure to that. Whereas when people say spiritual, sometimes they mean that they're, yeah, they just want us to see. They just want to say something that doesn't mean anything. Yeah. They want to say something you're ugly positive. The one I hear all the time as guys will say, you know, I'm up here in the mountains or I'm fishing and this is how I connect with God. I'm like, that actually might be true. Yeah. But they make it sound like anything outside of just organically connecting is the right and proper way. Yeah. Yeah. And obviously there are a bunch of ways to, you know, catch that fish. Right. And for again, different voices for different people. We were different and different things work for different people. I do think that, yeah, a lot of guys do have that experience and, you know, being out in nature, you do ascertain something eternal. There's some mountains are bigger than you and they're older than any of us. You know, there's big old things out in the world. I think that you can appreciate them that way. But that's, you know, to say that the also, you know, studying a religious text does not have value. I mean, that's like wisdom of mankind written down. For thousands and thousands of years. Yeah. For thousands and thousands of years where you're talking about like, you know, some of the myths or whatever that I'm talking about, where they're talking about the Bible. And so much of it hasn't changed. And it's that's that's one of the great things about, you know, when I was writing this book, you know, I was seeing so many overlapping ideas. Right. And, you know, whether you're reading, you know, ancient Greek philosophers or you're reading, you know, the Habamal from the old Norse. There's huge parts of it. They're just basic good guy advice. Yes. You know, it's a Heraclitus, you know, the agony and works in days and like that stuff is like, you know, basic guy advice like you shouldn't spend too much money. You should respect this and you're going to have to work hard if you want things in life and things that either you or I would say to anybody if they asked for good advice. Of course. They were giving the same advice in ancient Greece and and they were attributed to Odin in, you know, the old Norse and so much of his just good advice. And so like to say that there's no value in reading that good advice is foolish and can be lazy, you know, because some guys are not readers. They don't, they're just like, they don't want to read anything. And, and that's a little bit of laziness, you know, in certain ways. So it's harder for some guys and it is for others. But, you know, I think that we all can do that. You know, if you can make it through life, if you can read an email and you can make a comment on the Internet, you can share. Read a book. And you can also filter it through your lens and determine what is accurate and what is good and what is righteous and what will serve you and what won't. And what is useful at what time in your life. Yeah, good point. It changes with books is that, you know, you can read a book when you're 25 and it's garbage to you. Like it's like there's nothing or you interpret it entirely different way. And then, you know, as you get older, you might come back to the same book and like this is amazing. Like this is this is exactly right. This is exactly what I read. I wanted to read right now. Right. I mean, I did that with a lot of Nietzsche's work. You know, it's like you read it and, you know, for the quotes, like most people, they read me will read Nietzsche and they're like, here's some, you know, some badass quotes that I can put into some stuff or whatever when you're younger. And then, you know, I get to a different point in life. And I think in a weird way, I mean, each, I have a bunch of stuff in common. And, you know, I can listen to an audio book of, you know, it's not fake Zarathustra and be like laughing out loud, like, Oh, I get that. You know, it's a really good one, man. You know, like we're having a conversation, you know, I couldn't have done that at 25 because I didn't know enough. You know, I didn't know enough about certain things that I didn't know the references he was making and all kinds of things. So you can get different things out of different things at, you know, different points in your life. And I think that goes against the grain of what I've dealt with as a doctor in a popular culture, which is just take the sound snippet and then you interpret it through whatever lens or whatever narrative you want it to fit. And then it means what it means. Like Nietzsche's God is dead, for example, you know, you read that quoted a lot. Well, let's actually think about the context in which he was saying that. Let's look at the other text that supports that or that that dances around that and then look at it as a collective body and determine what he was actually saying versus what we did. What we're saying versus what we think we want him to be saying. Right. I mean, obviously like that that's a big, a lot of Christians hate Nietzsche and you know, he hits an issue, of course, for sure. But I mean, he was like that father of the pastor, but it's, yeah, if you look at the context of that and that was actually the first chapter of the book. And then we talked about that because what he was really talking about as a collapse of moral consensus. Right. A collapse of like agreement on what is good. And what it what what is the right life path and what is all the values of society we're really collapsing. And it was probably in part because you know that the break between Protestantism and Catholicism because when it was all Catholicism, everybody was on the same page. You know, Pope said that's what we did. And then there's that one break. And then that really started a lot of other breaks that eventually became tons and tons of different like sex and things and. And so you have a whole bunch of people with a whole bunch of different takes on things. And that that creates a lot of room to move for different people. And that's what he was really talking about. And I think that we're existing in the like final and well, I don't know. I mean, it could go deeper. I don't know. Like, we're like this collapse of moral consensus is what we're really seeing in America right now. And all around the world is that we can't agree on what is good and we can't actually even agree on what facts are. And that's a huge problem in society because then I literally don't trust anything I read in the news because like anymore. You can't. How can you? Yeah. And that's new. That's very I mean, 50 years ago, you know, Walter Conkite said a thing. Everybody's like, Oh, well, clearly that made some sense. That's exactly what it is. Yeah, that's supposed to be what happened. But now I assume they're lying to me about most things or that they're there. They're lying or that that information is incomplete. Or, you know, we haven't, you know, like they have shooters and so forth like that. You know, the first day commentary is always wrong. Right. So here's what everyone's going to say. Yeah, but then people get pissed at you because you didn't offer commentary. That's what people do to me is like, well, you know, you have this shooting situation and you didn't provide any commentary. I'm like, I know because I would like to see how this develops before I formulate a concise coherent opinion on the actual thing that took place. Yeah, instead of just running your mouth, which is what they want you to do. They run your mouth and tell me how to feel about this. Yes. What, you know, that's the job of a pundit. Really. They want you to fund it. Tell me how I'm supposed to feel about this event because I'm not sure how to feel about it. You don't know yet. If you're being responsible about what comes out of your mouth, you don't know yet. And that's one of the things. I mean, as I said, talked about Washington a lot in the book and that was one of the things that he was really good at. Although, I always wonder if he would even survive in modern society because he would have waited for a long time. I didn't think he would have played the game that's being played today. Right. Right. And someone wrote an article recently about Trump that said, because now that he doesn't have Twitter, he can't just run his mouth all day long. And it's actually kind of better because I guess he made a statement about some stuff that Biden was doing, but it was like a complete thought. Right. Instead of 40 characters or whatever it was. Yeah. Yeah. And, and I think that that's really what someone at that level should be doing at this point, instead of just like running their mouth. After each thing happens every single day. You know, wait until you form a responsible opinion about something that you can really get behind in that you're not going to have to back away from it in 15 minutes when the evidence all changes which it will. Well, either they either they'll back away from it, but more likely as they'll double down or their craft their narrative to fit to fit, you know, the craft their, their perception of it to fit the narrative that already exists in their mind. You know, one of the things I've seen with journalism in particular is it used to be that we would report the facts. So, for example, Jack Donovan and Ryan Mickler had a conversation on March 24th at 157 PM. That's the facts. Now, you can interpret that how you want, but now it's like, well, you know, Jack and Ryan talked about how they hate religion and, you know, and, and how they hate fat people. And so it's like they craft all these narratives based on this little sliver of a conversation that they don't paint within the, within the entire context of what it is that we actually talked about. It's wild, man. I mean, I'm fighting with Wikipedia and I have been because they started an article about me and it's the worst. And it's basically a long BuzzFeed article about anything that I've ever said that has offended anyone. Yes. And that's all it is. It's just quotes about they quotes about people who have been critical for me as just used to describe my entire life work. Right. And, you know, and as I said, we have a problem that we don't have anybody writing on our side. You know, like about anything. I mean, I'm like, it's really skewed because, well, I know I've sold thousands of books this month. And I get letters as you do every day for men who are like, Hey, you really changed my life. Thank you. You're doing something really positive. And we're all that stuff. And we both get that. And that's really the truth of what I'm doing. But the truth in that perspective is like, you know, here's all the things that somebody who doesn't like anything that Jack Donovan has ever written, ever said. Well, and part of the reason is because you can't grab like a quick sound bite of that. You know, you can't you can't extract just a quick sound bite of the nuance and the context and everything else. And this goes back to what you were saying earlier. We've become so lazy. I remember this was probably months ago. I made a post about a book. I was reading regarding Greek mythology and somebody had quipped back. Aren't you Christian? As if being Christian excludes me from reading about Greek mythology is like, I can explore these concepts. And I think that's what you do a great job illustrating not only in your work generally, but in your book of like, let's look for these truths. You know, maybe they're conjured up. Maybe they're myths. Maybe they never happened. Yeah. Is there still some things that we can learn from this story that might actually impact our lives in the in a positive? And what's absurd about that is that most of that material and especially the Norse material, but much of the Greeks, a lot of the classics we have because we have because monks sat around copying them like it monk. And he traces that around writing all that stuff down and translating it. And I mean, that's the only reason we have any of the Norse myths is because it's nori Sturlus and is, you know, who was a Christian wrote down a lot of this stuff. And a lot of this material is recorded by Christian monks. And obviously, I didn't know that it was the value. Oh, oh, totally. Yeah, yeah, it's all it's all written out my Christians. And because I mean, there is no, there is no written material and proto dramatic, like the language that they would have used at that time. Sure, because they wrote, you know, it's going to be translated and documented and scribed. It goes away. You know, and most of the people couldn't even write. So it was a preliterate culture. So like, yeah, they didn't have that. It's funny because I'll say something and somebody will say, well, you know, you know, Jocko said that I'm like, well, actually Aristotle said that 2000 years ago. Nobody said anything new. We're just kind of regurgitating it and then saying it in a way that is maybe more indicative of the times or the language or the way that it can be consumed. But it's all already there. Like, we're just saying it differently and it might might apply to you or it might. You might resonate with it or you might not, but we're all saying stuff that's already been said. Yeah, and somewhere another I mean, unless we're responding to something that wasn't invented yet. Yes, sure, of course. But in general terms. Yeah, I mean, that's, that's why I love the great stuff because they actually wrote everything down. So we actually do have that. And so we see all of their going back and forth and thinking about stuff. I mean, the way that they thought about religion and philosophy was also very varied because we have hundreds of years of that. And so they're like, I don't know if the gods are real or not. You know, there was, there was that going for hundreds of years. You know, like, I don't know if the gods are real or not. Maybe they are that, but you know, other people said that they absolutely were. They have different stories about how they evolved. You know, like, here's the one creation story. Here's another creation story. There's different authors have different takes on it. Yeah, to me, it's just the wrong target. You're focusing on the wrong issue. Look, I have faith that, that what I believe is true and accurate. I wouldn't believe that if I didn't think that was the case. But look, right. It's also faith, meaning I can't prove that. I don't know that with a hundred percent certainty. That said, it's the wrong target. And the right target is that what I believe has served me and millions of other people well. And if you learn that from, from Buddhism or Christianity or paganism or whatever, I don't care. We're all trying to improve. We're all trying to get better. Let's serve each other. Let's help. And I don't care which God you got it from. Let's just do it. Yeah. Yeah, no, absolutely. And that's, like I said, that's one of the big things that I came to about this book was looking at all these patterns and where they overlap. And here are the things that men have always talked about some basic ideas. They've always talked about the same things and they're talking about them with different gods with different names at different times. But they're all doing the same things. Like in this book, I talked about, obviously, you know, there's the archetype of the warrior, which is almost always the same. You know, it does the same story. And Joseph Campbell and people like that talked about this as well. Right. There's some very simple features. I mean, I can nerd out and tell you why Superman is basically the striker. And then I talked about this book. Oh, he's powered by the sun. He was lightning comes out of his eyes. He was adopted. All the things that Heracles was you can find the Superman myth that's been reinvented. Yeah. What is the significance of the whole solar concept stays solar, the solar concept that you've really embraced over the past summer years? Well, you know, I talk about the book about the idea of the father and then the father in darkness. And, you know, that's the hidden part of being the father figure is that I think that you have to obviously go into a place of confusion and indecision before you make the decision to do that. And then you have to go through the, oh, if I do this, if I tell them this, they're going to do that. If I tell them this, they're going to do that. I mean, that's what being that leader really involved. This, this, you know, depth into the darkness and confusion. And as far as the solar ideal, you know, I, I am a guy who goes towards forbidden things. I've always done that. That's just who I am. You know, if something, they tell me something's bad, I'm going to go look at it. Like I'll say for myself what that's all about. Yeah. I mean, that's who I am. And, you know, I'm, I'm, that pushes, I think, a lot of men to identify as being that. And I was associated with a lot of darkness and a lot of had that kind of thing around me a lot. And, but that's not really who I am. I'm actually a pretty happy guy. I'm not morose. I'm not focused on death, not focused on hurting people or, you know, insulting them and making life bad. That's not really who I am. I, I got into writing about masculinity really because of the heroic ideal. You know, I was obviously interested in all these bad things and whatever and villains and so forth, but they, I can't think of anything better in the world than heroic masculinity. I think that that, and when I saw that that was dying in the world in some way, and we're being degraded or being, you know, dismissed. That's kind of what got me signed on in many ways to, Hey, this is really important and people should care about this. And so I've just been exploring that in different ways for years. And it became the, the, the, the, the, the solar thing to me started out at Vol Gang, my land and I, you know, I had, there was this dark, dark culture that, you know, was really part of contemporary kind of odinism and that kind of stuff that was this. And that's, I think has to do with a lot of factors, but I'm like, there's too much darkness around us. And it's like, we need to get more solar and it just became that. And, you know, where their bones everywhere. Like, we need to change this. And I like to write things up. My joke has been a goal. I want gold. But it started out as an aesthetic thing, but then as I looked at it more and more and more, this idea of the sun as representing goodness and knowledge. And it represents truth as well. Light is especially, you know, I think about that in the Christian faith is that light is always synonymous with truth and goodness. Yeah, shine a light on it. Yeah. Yeah. And so all this, these ideas come really from this idea of the sun. And I talked about the in the book, The Idea of a Sky Father because that's also a very old idea and transcends religion. There's every religion kind of has a father in the sky. And in many ways, I think that comes from him. We could, you know, talk about context or whatever, but, you know, men need to look up to something. And literally, when we're boys, we looked up to our fathers, but not really our father, but the idea of a father, because you can't be your father. You're going to be like him, but you're not going to be him. You're going to be something else. You'll be an idea, like a platonic form of a father. And I think that men throughout history, it's like, well, what does the father look up to? You know, like, what's the father be on the father? This higher idea? Like, what is the most perfect idea? Like, of everything that you're trying to do in your life, what is the most perfect form of that that you can imagine? And that becomes God. In many ways, like this, this is completely. Yeah, I mean, that's your ideal. And that's what you, that's your North Star then. That's the thing that you're trying to become more like. When you judge your own behavior, you're looking up towards this ideal that's better than you and being like, I want to be more like that. Right. And what would that do? I actually had these made, because, you know, I've been talking about George Washington. I had little bracelets made that say, what would Washington do? Because, oh, really? I'll have to pick one up. Yeah, yeah, that's just, it's just for fun. I haven't even put them up for sale yet. I just, you know, I've had a bunch of them made. But, yeah, I mean, that's, that's a pretty good idea. Like, what would Washington do in this situation? It's probably a good answer. Yeah, that's a good point. As you know, it's funny, as you were talking about that, I just picked up this new watch. It's a Garmin watch. And it's the, I think it's like the Phoenix solar version or something. And as I picked it up, I was thinking of you. I'm like, man, this reminds me of Jack. And it's actually got, you can't see it, but it's actually got like a little thing of like, how often I'm out in the sun. And, and, and that, the sun, what's interesting about this watch is the sun actually recharges the battery in the watch itself, which is kind of an interesting concept. Yeah. So it's kind of funny. You know, I think about that even in our faith, you know, in Tanner's very much the same way because we, we should have the same faith. And I don't know if you guys have talked about this. I know you guys are personal friends, but in our faith, we have the, what we would, what we would say is the highest degree of glory, which is the celestial kingdom, which is signified by the sun. Like this isn't this isn't any new thing, right? This is as old as man himself. Yeah. Yeah. No, I mean, no, I love talking to, we've sat here in this room actually and talked about the ritual and religion and stuff for hours. We have a really good back and forth about that kind of stuff because, you know, at the end of the day, we're talking about a lot of the same ideas. Yes. And, and that's what I think is really interesting. And I think that's right. That's also really important. That's one of the reasons why I wanted to go in that direction with this book is because we're at a really, you know, rough time in history for men. As far as the, and I'd much rather reach out to all these guys. We're in the same fight. Like, you know, there's a lot of people would be like, one divide us in all kinds of ways that don't matter anymore. You know, like there's a real problem with masculinity and freedom right now that is like super seeds, all other concerns. I think, and that's, I think really important to look for these commonalities. Like, what do we both care about that matters? Rather than like, you know, what is this, you know, minutia that we can, we can debate. Let's argue about Mr. Potato Head as opposed to let's argue or let's get on the same page about, you know, serving our families and the people we care about and making ourselves more capable and having some money in the bank account and creating some experiences for ourselves, which is really what everybody wants. Not the fact that Mr. Mrs. Potato Head is this or that or gender neutral. Like, nobody actually cares about that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I think that, you know, that especially, you know, for all these guys who are talking about men in masculinity, we have, we, we're in it for basically the same reasons. You know, we care about the same things to a greater or lesser extent. And so let's find those commonalities and what's, and that's why I think the solar message has kind of caught on with a lot of guys. Creating all kinds of like solar accounts and all. I know I've seen them all. I've seen a bunch of them like, yeah, that's Jack's influence, which I love to see, man. Yeah, yeah, and it's great and it's so positive. I can't be embarrassed about that. No, I've seen the same thing with Sovereign Team. Like the sun and being strong and being emotionally controlled and all kinds of things. I'm like, nothing to be ashamed of there. Not at all. Yeah, I feel the same way about sovereignty. You know, I wrote that book three years ago and I see you guys talking about sovereignty and I see their Instagram handles and their, their user ideas ideas as sovereign so and so and so and I'm like, that's awesome. Whether they learned it for me or somebody else, I think. Yeah. Great. Because it was there long before I ever introduced it. That's for sure. Yeah. Yeah. But I mean, yeah, it's great to put that kind of stuff out there. And that's something you could really be proud of at the end of the day. You know, you're, you know, it's undeniably positive influence, although I mean, I guess someone else, someone else would disagree in some way, you know, the people who were, you know, against headhead or whatever. But it's, yeah, I mean, I think you really have to grasp it straws to say that trying to help men improve themselves is somehow a negative thing. But, you know, like you said, people do grasp at those straws and people do it. But it's not, not something worthy of consideration. Yeah. No, absolutely. I think that, you know, at the end of the day, I think we both be proud of what we're doing and putting out there and that's, that's, that's exciting. I mean, it's good to have a legacy that you can be proud of. 100% and, and something that you can share. This goes back to the pride thing and knowing that, you know, your children will pick up some of that, not all of it because they're going to get their own ideas, but they'll pick up some of that and other. It's just a good thing. Well, Jack, man, I appreciate our conversations. I'm looking forward to getting together with you person face to face at some point here in the near future. But guys, if you haven't picked up a copy of fire in the dark, it's already out. Correct. This is, I know this is an advanced copy, but I think it's already out if I remember correctly. Yeah, it's out in paperback right now. Probably by the time this airs, it'll be on audible because I finished that. I'm just getting the submission ready. So did you do that in your own, you know, narrative voice that you were alluding to earlier today? It's so much work, man. It's a lot of work. Yes, I did. So, and this one had so many different languages in it. It's like, oh, did I use Greek and Old Norse and Iranian in this program? And I have to look how to pronounce them all. So it's a work worth doing. Yeah, yeah. I mean, people really like to hear authors read in their own voice. And so I think it's worth doing. And so, yeah, I, I definitely enjoyed it as I got closer to the end. Yeah, no, I bet. I bet. Well, Jack, I appreciate you. I do appreciate our personal friendship. And I also appreciate truth be told some of the things that you've challenged me on in positive ways, of course, where you pushed back on an idea or an information or something that I've shared. And I thought, you know, coming from you, a man that I respected admire, I take that to heart and I really ponder over that. And sometimes I agree and sometimes I don't, but the fact that you're willing to share it. And then I respect you. It says a lot. And I just really appreciate our friendship and our conversations over the past several years. So thanks for joining us, brother. All right, guys, there you go.
