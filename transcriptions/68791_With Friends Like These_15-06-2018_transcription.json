    "text": " Hi, I'm Anna Marie Cox and welcome to With Friends Like These, the show where we talk about the differences between us without letting them divide us. My guest today is Charlotte Clymer. She is on the rapid response communications team for the human rights campaign and we are going to talk a bit about the Trump administration's sort of still developing ban or restriction on trans people in the military. So we're going to talk about Charlotte because now spoiler alert here, Charlotte is herself a trans person and then further spoiler alert, I got to know her before she came out as a trans person. Now, those two things are not the most important things about her and her experience is not actually super typical of a trans person. And so actually she and I talked a lot about whether or not we were going to talk about this stuff. And she was her instinct was kind of to not and we talk about why she had that instinct and I won't do too many spoilers but we talk about that. Very meta conversation. But I wanted to have her on and I wanted to talk about this stuff because even though I consider myself pretty educated about inclusivity and sensitivity, I think I do the best practices for those things. I actually found myself having some kind of awkward interactions with Charlotte. Now super fans may know that I have had another trans person on the show who's great, the very super awesome Parker Malloy. And I've never felt that awkward with her because I think I've known her since she transitioned and also for a while I didn't even know she was trans. So in some ways it's been pretty easy for me to figure out how to interact with her. I'm not self-conscious about it. But with Charlotte, I am super aware of whether or not I'm doing things right. And so well, we talk about it. I ask some stupid questions like, what does cis mean? And we talk about the importance of getting your pronouns right, but also about not being too embarrassed or self-conscious when you don't get that stuff right. Because I think the real goal of anyone who's trying to be a good ally is to make and maintain real human connections. Which suffer or get neglected when someone gets too scared of making a mistake? Charlotte and I also talk through a listener question that deals really directly with people wanting to be helpful, but not really knowing how. You know what Charlotte and I don't really get into specifically is something I'll say right now, which is why these questions and this issue is so important at this very moment. 2017 was the deadliest year on record for trans people in this country. Non-fatal trans violence is also on the rise. I think we're at a time when visibility and real acceptance haven't caught up with each other. Unfortunately visibility is always going to lead acceptance. And it's up to people who want to be allies to lead more on acceptance. Now I think there's still some liberals and progressives that dismiss trans issues as social issues or identity politics. But to echo a little bit something you'll hear me talk about later, that is exactly right. Trans issues are about society and identity. But they're not really related to who trans people are. They're related to who we all are and what kind of society and what kind of people we want to be. So all that and even more with Charlotte climber coming right up. Welcome to the show Charlotte climber who is the press secretary for rapid response at the human rights campaign. Hi Charlotte. Hey, it's good to be here. So rapid response I kind of want to like quiz you now. I want to like throw things at you and make you respond. Oh god. There's a lot of news you could be responding to. You must be busy. It's pride week. I am very busy. Every day it just never ends. Well it's pride month first of all let me correct myself. And then also at the same time it's pride month we're living under an incredibly repressive administration. So yes we are. So yeah, I imagine you must be busy. I specifically wanted to have you on to talk a little bit about an issue that's kind of faded from public consciousness a little bit I think because we do live in just an onslaught of shit. It's true. It's true. It's true. Which is the ban on transgender military personnel. Which was you know that's right eating like many other policies it can kind of stand in for the whole Trump way of approaching the world because it was you know decided on the fly as a sort of quid pro quo to an interest group. The policy wasn't incredibly well thought out and when the policy did get a little more thought out it was thought out badly. What is the status of that right now? So right now it's circulating the courts. And illegal who's a great LGBTQ organization is pursuing it in the courts. And HRC and other LGBTQ orgs are backing them up with communications organizing and what not. So it's being challenged in the courts and I'm hopeful but I don't take anything for granted and nor should anyone else. I will say that on the merits of their arguments they're complete bullshit from beginning to end. I mean just a just a long line of never ending bullshit. So that's good. No I think there's something I suspect that there you know I often describe my audience as well meaning white people. There's probably also a huge portion their well meaning cis people. So I'm actually going to ask a question that I did not realize I was going to ask which is could you explain what cis is? Yeah so transgender is basically having a gender identity that's different from the sex you were assigned at birth. Sis gender is that the way that you conform to cultural expectations is in line with the sex you were assigned at birth. It doesn't have to be a perfect overlap but in general if you are assigned female at birth for example and the world perceives you as female from the get go you're cisgender. And what does cis stand for? Oh cis stands for cisgender I'm sorry. Well I mean actually just what I'm just curious now does it have a particular meaning why it says TIS or is it just? Oh no idea. No clue whatsoever. I haven't given much thought to that. Because I think there's sort of again among the well meaning cis people there's like okay I know that means not transgender and I want to do do right and I want to be inclusive so I'm going to just go ahead and identify that way. And then I think that there also might be some misunderstanding about why these arguments are bad against having transgender people in the military. First of all cis is from the Latin derived prefixes me on this side of. So that's where that comes from and I feel a little smarter now so I appreciate that. And trans I mean you know obviously it's going it's in a middle ground of sorts. So okay so let's go through these arguments right. When Trump tweeted his ridiculousness last year the crooks of his argument was based on financial stuff he felt that providing health care for transgender folks in the military was an enormous burden on the American taxpayer. The Rand Institute did a study on this and they found that based on their best estimate the upper limit of what transgender folks would cost in terms of health care every year in the US military 8.4 million total. That's total out of you know our enormous military 8.4 million and on the lower end they guessed probably or they estimated somewhere around 2.4 million dollars. Now you compare that to something like for example I believe it's the F-18 fighter jet project that's cost got billions and billions of dollars over the last 15 years and it's still gone nowhere. You compare that to the you know studies that come out every six months about the Pentagon losing several hundred million dollars that they can't account for. You know I would even compare it to you know the and I can't get this exactly but I think believe it's something like 30 to 40 million dollars the US military spends on Viagra alone every year. I get to say something about this which is someone pointed out to me like we shouldn't use that talking point too much or make fun of it because I mean it is like a serious health issue for people and if we want to take that. No and I was going to say the exact same thing. I don't believe that should be used that way and I do think it's a good comparison because it's talking about reproductive health and our larger health related to reproductive systems and the way that we derive some kind of cultural esteem from how we present to the world right. That's right. Yeah I think it's a great direct comparison. It's like if you think that's important for someone you know then you should probably think that having your trans identity validated is important for people. Absolutely. Absolutely yeah I would never want folks to make fun of those who use Viagra or Cialis or anything like that but it does speak to the sheer bullshit of that argument. Just the idea that you know it's too costly. It makes no sense whatsoever. I mean God Trump is replacing the refrigerators on Air Force One at an enormous cost. I want to say something like God I can't get this right exactly. I have a $25 million or $30 million or something like that to replace those. Some enormous amount and you know you have the military parade that's going to be this year ostensibly in November. That cost that ironically costs right around the same amount that it would be to fund health care for openly transgender people in the military for a year. So I think that was a lovely little bit of irony. And see that's a much more of like a you know phallic symbol than the Viagra thing that's like. And that's how you saw things. I want your listeners to know this because civilians may not know this. There is not a member of the armed forces who would ever wake up in the morning on a Saturday or whenever the hell this parade is going to be held. And thank gosh I wish I could be in a parade today. It's annoying. It is tedious. You know you just spend all day doing this hurry up and wait kind of routine. So the idea that we're honoring the troops by hosting a needless parade that's going to cost me when that money could go elsewhere. You know and that's why you saw all these polls in the army times military times in which you know most service members thought the idea was ridiculous. Because it is. And you have now brought up something that I wanted to ask you about which is you just referenced you have been a troop. I have yes a troop indeed. And also you are transgender. That's right I am proudly transgender. I'm a transgender woman. So I would like you to speak a little bit to the other argument that Mattis made secretary Mattis made about trans people in the military which is that it would be bad for unit cohesion which is I think something they just say when they don't like it and they don't like something. People made that argument about integrating along race lines as well. So and yeah you are you are hammer on the now with that one. You know that's the same argument that was brought up with you know a black folks free of black folks serving during the Civil War. It was done integrating troops in the 40s. It was done with you know the repeal of no nastole tell which we found to be completely the opposite. It was done with the combat exclusion policy on women being lifted recently. And not only you know what I you know and I think the last study I read on it was that not only was there no loss of unit cohesion in those units. But having women in those units is actually beneficial to unit morale and cohesion overall because they just bring something different to the table. Maybe a different perspective or a different life experience can be useful. But back to the you know you followed up the transgender thing. All four service chiefs recently when testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee were asked by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand if they you know could conceive of any sort of examples of unit cohesion or morale being affected by the open service of transgender service members. And not one said that all four said they had no evidence that unit cohesion will be a problem. So I'm not sure where you know Mr. Mattis retired general Mattis is getting his facts. But that's that doesn't seem to be the opinions of those on the ground. And people may wonder like you can't you could speak to the general issue of unit cohesion because you're a veteran. But you were not out as trans while you were serving. No I was not. I was not. I was not out of trans. But I will say that I did before I leave see as few folks who were starting to transition. And it was kind of an open secret. And no one had an issue with it because these soldiers did their jobs. They were right place right time right uniform ready to get the mission done. And that also speaks to the other side of this argument is that you're going to have in the military we call them shit bags you're going to have shit back soldiers people who just don't care. And they're not living up to the standard. But you see that across all general identities, you know, sexes, races, religions, you know, the soldier who doesn't live up to the standard kind of transcends all of those categories. So if we're going to talk about standards that we need to talk about, for example, the young men in infantry units who aren't measuring up to their PT standards but are given chance after chance after chance to measure up to them. Some of them will go three or four years during their enlisted service without meeting those standards. So I again, I find the standards argument just bullshit. And I'm interested too. So you were starting to transition as right before you left. No, no. Okay. You knew people who were transitioning. Right. Right. Other people friends of mine who were starting a transition starting to get hormones. And they were already, you know, like one of my friends and I won't say our day of on here because we didn't talk about this beforehand. But oh, well, excuse me. Let me let me back up her. Oh my God. I meant I did it again. Can we cut that out? That part out, Annamarie. Did you miss gender someone? I miss gendered. Yeah, by accident because I was thinking of thinking of them when they were in the service. If you don't mind, I would actually like to keep that in because I want to I like I've made mistakes like that in talking to people and I people make mistakes like that. And I think what's important is that we catch ourselves and try to do better. Yeah, absolutely. I didn't want to make him feel uncomfortable if he heard this. Right. But no, I think that's a great topic for discussion. Yeah, because I'll be honest, Charlotte, I because I knew you before you started transitioning, it took me a couple took me a couple times of talking about you before I got it. Oh, yeah. I got it. And I'm going to use the word straight, but you know what I mean. Right. Before I came out. Yeah. No, that makes complete sense. What I've told, you know, all my friends and family when they mess up is that, you know, you're trying and that's what matters to me. I'm not going to get angry with you if you accidentally misgender me. And I don't speak for all trans people on that, but you know, as long as a person approaches in good faith, that's what matters to me. No matter who you are, brushing your teeth is one of the most important parts of your day. You have to do it to stay healthy. Quip knows that and their team of dentists and designers is focused on helping you take care of your mouth better.

Journalist, Maddy Hassan is known around the world for his televised takedowns of presidents and prime ministers. He hosts up front on Al Jazeera and is a columnist for the Intercept and in his new podcast, Deconstructed. Maddy unpacks a game-changing news event of the week while challenging the conventional wisdom in a tight 30-minute package. A little quicker than what we do here. He starts his show with his take on one topic and what the mainstream news is getting wrong or what context is being missed. And then he goes into a deep analysis in conversation with his guest or guests of the week. And get this, his guests have included Judd Apatow, Bernie Sanders, and Hassan Minhaj. So he kind of covers the gamut, I would say, in terms of who you might be expecting. It's everyone from comedians to politicians to, for instance, Stefan Clark's fiance. So you're going to hear from a lot of different people. And this show has covered such topics as the violence in Gaza, from the perspective of Israeli activists against the occupation, and of course, police shootings as through the eyes of the fiance of Stefan Clark. Also, he's talked about the dangers of John Bolton with former diplomats. As a Brit and a Muslim and immigrant based in Donald Trump's Washington, D.C., Mede-Hassan gives a refreshingly provocative perspective on the ups and downs of American and global politics. Deconstructed is a show that cuts through political drivel and media misinformation to give you a straight take on one big news story of the week. It is out every Friday, just like this pod. You can listen and subscribe at theintercept.com slash deconstructed or on any podcast platform. You were going to tell the story about this friend of yours. So I've worked. Right. So my friends, he was already presenting as a woman, but more butch and kind of butch lesbian in his own words. And I don't think anyone really cared because he just did the job he needed to do. And I think that's what at the end of the day matters to most. And I would say all reasonable adults in the military. And was that helpful for you to see people be accepted that way, to see that your friend be accepted that way? Yes, it was. It absolutely was. You know, at the time before I got out, Don't Ask Don't Tell was under pretty heavy debate. In fact, I think it was, I mean, I must have gotten out two months after or two months before it became official. Don't Ask Don't Tell. And, you know, the debate was raging. And I knew, you know, Dave Downer was no way in hell. I was going to explore this part of me that needed exploring. That desperately needed exploring because it was just asking for trouble. But seeing, for example, my friend as he went through his process and did it without apology, that definitely meant a lot to me, especially down the road when I needed, you know, folks in my life who I saw were success stories in that way. I know that we are having kind of a natural conversation about representation right now. And I think it's valuable, but I still get blown away by how much each individual instance of representation can matter. You know, like just seeing someone who you identify with doing their thing. And I would not be out right now. We're not for people like Sarah McBride, Laverne Cox, Janet Mock, you know, these trans folks and many more beyond them who lived out and proudly and didn't feel like they had to apologize for the people they are. You know, the day to day lives, and I'm, you know, obviously I've learned this quite a bit more since I came out, but the day to day lives of trans people are so just, I think, filled with stress and anxiety about how to calibrate yourself to the world around you that you need a reminder and looking to folks who are in the public spotlight that, oh yeah, that person is, you know, proud of who they are in their surrounding my people who love them and care about them. And obviously they have a lot of folks who support them. So there's hope for me, you know. So yeah, I feel like, and you know, I hesitate to say this because I don't want it to be misconstrued. I, ever since I come out, I really feel like I have an obligation, me personally, and not other trans folks, I'm only speaking for me here, is to go into every space I can as a trans person, not to make a big spectacle, but just to be seen, just to be seeing as who I am for other people to see me because they may be going through the same thing internally and not have the support yet to come out. Seeing those things in our media, in film, on TV, and in our politics, you know, seeing Deannika Rome, when her election against arguably the most anti-LGBTQ state legislature in the country last year was enormous for me. You know, that happened, I want to say that happened a month before I came out. And it really, really meant a lot to me. And I think that was one of those little pushes that I needed to, you know, get over the hump of all the anxiety. And I'm struck by, it's not just famous people, but this friend of yours who was transitioning in the military, that, you know, his experience, just being himself and being supported by others, that that mattered. I mean, it sounds like it mattered as much as Laverne Cox could matter. If not more so. If not more so. You know, for a long time, he was the only person I had in my life who I was close to, who I could talk about these things. You know, years before I came out, I was confiding in him just little things. And what he said to me over and over is that, you know, there's no right way to do this. And you got to take your own time with it. Don't feel like you're on anyone else's timeline because you're not. And, you know, having someone tell me that really took a lot of pressure off and allowed me to kind of navigate whatever challenges and, you know, contingencies I could see on the horizon. I was, I was openly, I was out as genderqueer for three years. And when I say genderqueer, you know, my particular presentation as genderqueer was more, you know, with a touch of feminine, but mostly masculine because I was too scared. I was really scared of kind of just taking that, that next step, that huge step of telling people, you know, how I really felt. And at the same time, I was looking at working with my therapist through all these issues. And I don't want to take up, you know, too much of the podcast was talking about this, but I knew from a very early age that something was off, that something felt incongruent with the world around me, or with, you know, how other folks were experiencing things. But, you know, my problem is that baseline, that's a big challenge, right? But then, you know, I grew up in an abusive home. So, I didn't really have any adults that I could talk to about it. You know, I was, you know, sexually abused. And believe it or not, that kind of complicates things because it entangles the way that, you know, you can perceive sexuality versus to drydity versus, you know, how folks interact with you based on that. And so, you know, I said it, when I sat down with my therapist, I didn't bring up the general identity thing for a good three years. And finally, you know, I approached it with her, and I remember that session, it took me, and I'm not kidding about this, it took me three or four minutes of just trying to get up the words, of just trying to tell her how I felt inside and how I'd always felt inside. I felt really shamed by it. Not only a embarrassed by this issue, but also just a very large sense of shame that I couldn't talk about this without feeling bad about myself. So, we had a lot of untangling to do. And so, it blows my mind that there are millions of folks in this country who don't have that, who don't have that kind of access to therapy, access to medical support, who don't live in a city like DC with, you know, my large network of friends who were immediately supportive when I came out, you know, kind of reached out with open arms to ask what they could do to help. And not to mention, just having a platform where if I get pissed off at something like the Lyft driver who was nasty to me a few months ago, I can go on Twitter and talk about it. You know, most trans folks can't do that. So, I feel very lucky and at the same time, I, that's why I kind of feel like I personally have an obligation to kind of use all of that privilege that I have to help others. I'm sorry to answer. You know, I am honored that you shared that. I think it's really powerful to hear your individual experience. And I also really appreciate you acknowledging the privilege that you have. And when people think about what they can do, you know, when these well-meaning people who may not think that they can do much about like trans visibility or trans equality, what you can do is support policies that give more people the tools that you had. Right. That's right. And also you can love people for who they are. You can accept people for who they are. I think it's really interesting. There's a talking point among conservatives, social conservatives. I don't, you know, our terms are so fucked up these days. Like, I don't even know if that's even the right way to describe what I'm talking about. But who are like, it's such a small percentage of the population. And I'm like, yeah, we don't know. We don't know. We don't know of a small percentage. And what we do know is that there are a lot of people walking around feeling unloved and unsure of who they are. And that, so being accepting of the people in your life, the way you talk matters, if you're someone who thinks that you don't have trans people in your life, you should still think about how you speak. Right. You should absolutely think about how you speak. Yeah. Yeah. I think we're, you know, I have someone who I have, I cop to, I used to use really incentive language under the umbrella of it being funny. I don't think it's funny anymore. And then the other thing I wanted to point out about what you had to say inclusive of your point about privilege is that I know when you and I have had background conversations about this, like you've pointed out that your experience is not representative of trans experience in general, and that there are a lot of people who don't bring, you know, who don't have the privilege to stand on that you did. And those voices and experiences need to be heard more. Like, I think a lot of media kind of flocked to you because you were kind of public facing before you came out. And your story got told pretty widely and you got supported because you're in DC. But you have been, you've tried to be pretty careful about raising up other voices. Yes, I mean, you know, and I don't think I've done it perfectly as, I don't think anyone can do perfectly, but I, you know, I've made mistakes in the past with just general, and I think this is something all allies make in general is just mistakes about space. And you learn over time how to navigate space in a way that is helpful and not prohibitive. I've been very self-conscious about, you know, just the amount of space I take up in what the public feels about trans people in general, and how they perceive them. Because, you know, I am a transgender person, but I'm white, identify as Christian. I have, you know, a pretty good financial privilege. I'm able-bodied. Yeah. You know, there are all these things that, you know, not to mention, I live in one of the more trans-friendly cities in America, if not the world, DC. You know, these are things that I have to take into account. And so when someone invites me onto a panel, I'll say, you know, have you thought of this trans-monive color who's doing really great work? Or have you thought about getting someone from a community of disability who's working on, you know, those issues? It's very important that, you know, we're good allies, even as we do encounter oppression. And I'm not saying people do it perfectly, and I'm sure as hell don't do perfectly, but being willing to make mistakes and reflect on them is really important. And I think that's a lesson that we all, especially in this field, especially with our platforms, have to have to be more conscious of. I want to make clear to listeners that this seems hypocritical that we're talking about this. Like, I would just got after you. I really wanted to talk to you because you are kind of a Twitter friend that I wanted to have you on the show because I think, you know, your story is interesting. But you also were, you know, pretty clear that you wanted to raise up some of their voices. So, who is someone that I should be paying attention to that listeners should be paying attention to? One of my favorite activists, especially in DC, is Ruby Carado. She's a transgender woman who founded Casa Ruby, which is the only bilingual, multicultural, LGBTQ organization in DC. And, you know, she is all about opening up her doors to transgender, genderqueer, gender-narc conforming people in addition to the wider LGBTQ community. But she's been really essential in just providing this community of resources and support for LGBTQ folks in the DC area. And I would say the DMV area in general. So, she's pretty amazing. All right. So, she's considered her, you know, penciled in. I have to obviously talk to her first, but I definitely appreciate it. I just think, you know, no one's perfect at it. And this show is, I try to treat this show as an exercise in recovering from perfectionism. So, the imperfectness of this exchange and booking you is very much appreciated. But speaking of getting better- And how to make mistakes. Let's all make mistakes together. Yes. I want to take a quick break. And then we have a question from a listener that I wanted to have you on specifically to talk about. So, we'll be right back. So, Thrive Market is a store, an online store for people that would go to, you know, your other brand of health food store that I couldn't name, but I don't think I'm supposed to. If you go to that big store, that's a big health food store that rhymes with moon's. You'll probably like Thrive. They sell all the top organic and healthy products for 25 to 50% off in a ship straight to your door. They have all the top premium healthy or organic products that you could find it that I usually get from the moon. But unlike your typical organic products that are marked up to premium prices, Thrive Market sells the same premium products at wholesale prices. Now, how do they do that? Thrive Market cuts out all the middlemen and works directly with the brands, and then they pass the savings to you. That's sort of how direct marketing, you know, works. And Thrive Market does that. And even better, for everyone who signs up, Thrive Market donates a membership to a low-income family, a veteran or a teacher. So, together, we're all making healthy, living affordable for everyone. It's a company I'm honored to support. Now, they also make it really easy to shop. Not only does it have, you know, everything you would get at that other grocery store and ship straight to your door. But if you have specific interests and specific dietary concerns, you can sort by that dietary concern, organic, vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, paleo, sustainably farmed, all of that, you can just sort with a click. So, get 25% off your first order in a free 30-day trial. Keep in mind, the prices are already 25 to 50% off. And now they're giving you that extra 25% off your first order and a free 30-day trial. Do the math. I won't. But that's a very good deal. If you spend $100 at the grocery store, it will be around 50 to 75 dollars on Thrive Market because of the already low prices. And now they're giving you an extra 25% off. So, if you're making a grocery run this week and you are not looking forward to it, why not give Thrive Market a try and shop from your home?

They do the homework for you. That's ThriveMarket.com slash friends. If you have a defined personal style and maybe even more, if you don't, you know how easy it is to fall into a rut and wear the same thing every day. I mean, there's something to be said for that. But at the same time, it can feel like a rut. And if it feels like a rut, that's a problem. If it feels like a uniform that you like, fine. It feels like a rut. Well, you might want to switch things up and I fully, heartily, personally recommend Stitch Fix. This is a service that I use before they became an advertiser on the show. I'm a huge fan. They are the personal stylist for people that don't think of themselves as needing personal stylists or who thought they couldn't afford a personal stylist, perhaps. You give them like your Instagram feed and your Pinterest page and someone, an individual person who will write you a personal note, picks out some clothes for you, picks out a few outfits for you. And with summer coming or having come depending on where you live, where we are, it's still pretty cold, is a perfect time to try and some new things. So maybe you need some new looks to get through the wedding season or maybe you need some options because it's 100 degrees outside and 50 degrees inside your office. Stitch Fix will help you with all of that. You just tell them your sizes, some information about your lifestyle and your preferred budget. And again, this budget can be anything. You don't have to be a very fancy person. And one of their stylists will send you clothes and accessories, pick just for you. You don't even have to leave the house. Why is it so many of my advertisers are about not leaving the housing? I feel a little tight cast, but I also enjoy not leaving the house.

Stitch Fix.com slash friends for 25% off when you keep all five items. So we have a listener question and I have some audio for it. So let's hear that question now. In the summer of 2016, I started my first academic job at a small rural college. I realized pretty quickly that it was the widest place I've ever lived. And over time, I've also realized that the culture of the campus is pretty regressive. Well, there is a small group of us who are advocating for things like staff and student training to promote inclusivity on campus. We have been met repeatedly by resistance from our colleagues as well as our superiors. What are some steps that I, a well-meaning white heterosexual woman among a group of white heterosexual faculty, can take to make sure that all of my students are safe and respected outside of my classroom. So Charlotte, I feel like this is like this is what HRC does, right? So I also want to say I really appreciate kind of the place that woman is coming from. So what do we do with this well-meaning person? Okay, I think, first of all, it's good to embrace nuance. You know, individuals can do a lot, but you're not going to do everything overnight. And so giving yourself, you know, kind of the space and not to rhyme here, but the grace to slowly be a force of change in your community, or in any space that you live or work is good. And it's not only beneficial to you, but beneficial to the folks you're trying to help. And the reason I say that is because the experience of, you know, a teacher in, I don't know, a really progressive school community in LA is going to be different from one in, say, Round Rock, Texas, you know, where I lived for several years. It's going to be different in the way that resources are available to you. And if you have supportive school administrators or parents who are not knocking down your door, because you were quote unquote too liberal in your classroom, I will say, here's the baseline. I wish more than anything that I had had someone who I could have talked to when I was a kid about all of this. And, you know, when I think of my favorite teachers, there's no way in hell I would have talked to them about gender identity and feeling like I was really a girl. And wanting to, you know, explore that and know more about it. I think baseline providing an open ear and letting, you know, your students know that you're someone they can talk to about these issues is huge. I mean, it's enormous. It really is. Going beyond that, respecting pronouns, teaching your class, you know, why pronouns should be respected, you know, enforcing, you know, the way that, you know, your students talk to each other in regards to gender identity or sexuality. And those are just the baseline, right? Going beyond that, lobbying your school board for education programs or awareness, you know, cosponsoring an LGBTQ student group on campus. And I would say letting whenever possible students lead these efforts is really good. Because, and this is something you and I talked on background about, there's, there's, there can be some tricky politics with, with being an ally and trying to help and being full of good intentions, but maybe taking up too much space. And so I would say whenever you can support a student-led effort to make folks more aware of LGBTQ politics and the struggles of LGBTQ people that much better for it. I was thinking about this particular situation, this person's in, and how we knew you mentioned pronouns and the first segment we were talking about how in our individual lives just be respectful and loving, that it is also really powerful that when you can kind of be casual about inclusivity, you know, when you can use correct gender pronouns, even if there may be like unwieldy for most people, if it's a they, let's say, or something like that. And you just kind of do it, you know, or you talk about someone's gender, or you talk about gender identity in a way that's not, you know, an assumption about hetero normativity, right? Like if you, for instance, in class, I don't know what you, I can't even remember. I don't think she said what she teaches. If you're in a class and someone uses pronouns, you know, male pronouns to discuss an unknown person, like you might be like, Hey, you know, let's not do that. And also if you, if people make assumptions, you just in like, I, like my dad is a professor. And I remember he did this before it was cool, but I remember being moved to even though I'm his daughter, like hearing him use she to describe like some hypothetical actuary, he teaches actual science. And he was like, in a class saying like, so this in this problem, you know, we have an actuary who's dealing with a insurance company who wants to know the risk, you know, risk of this particular cohort and what she needs to do is, right? And how does even like doing that can matter? And if she's in that conservative environment, I think even that can be an important kind of signal to people. And it makes me sad that some folks, you know, even some progressives roll their eyes at that, but that can be really important. It can to hear someone you respect, an authority figure, kind of signal, and you know, ha ha virtue signaling, but no seriously signal that, you know, if you're if you're a woman out there who wants to, you know, be an astronaut or head up NASA someday, you know, I support you if you are a queer kid, you know, making a point about pronouns means a lot. Yeah, making a pronoun about using his little things, right? Like not assuming like saying partner rather than husband or wife saying spouse rather than husband or wife, you know, I mean, I think that my thing lately is that I no longer say mom and dad, because I used to say, you know, if you're a mom and dad or whatever, I say nice, now say parents, like if you're a parental figures or parents or whatever. I do think that that stuff matters. And also again, like if she's in this conservative environment, then that stuff is going to stand out, you know, and her students might be able to to know, yeah, she has virtue signaled and maybe if I show up for office hours and have a question about something this person will, you know, listen, and not judge me. They'll be open. Yeah. When I was at West Point, I remember vividly, there was a class and my my friend happened to be in the same class. He was. And it was about 10 of us. And this old grizzled, retired one star general was teaching the course. I think it was calculus two of a not mistaken. But, you know, he made a point of doing the same thing. Like he used a female pronoun for like some fictional, you know, a higher level mathematician. And I think if I'm not mistaken, one of our classmates said she is like, yeah, she she did this. And it was so funny how casually he dismissed that that, you know, fellow cadets question. And next to me, my friend is like, you know, pinch me like, you know, that look at this guy, like he gets it. You know, he seems to get why things like that are important. And then sure enough, you know, over the rest of the semester, it was clear that even though this was, you know, this, this kind of grizzled retired army officer, he understood the importance of feeling like you belong and feeling like it's not silly for a woman to believe that she can, you know, be a great scientist someday or, you know, for someone to be attracted to someone of the same sex or for a person who's in the closet to, you know, not so be apprehensive down the road about coming out as transgender or non-binary or genderqueer of sorts. So yeah, we laugh at virtue signaling. And I know that there are some folks in the progressive movement who kind of think it's nonsense, but it's not. It really does save lives. It really, really does. And I will say about virtue signaling, what I say about social justice warrior is show me the word in those things that's bad. Right. Just as a warrior, all seem like good things. Virtue and signaling, those seem like good things. You know what it is, by the way, I think it's because, you know, a lot of folks these days are too afraid to be vulnerable. We have this really big strand within the progressive movement. That's all about ironic detachment and not taking things too seriously. And I've even heard, you know, I've heard the term regressive applied to people who do believe, yeah, it fucking matters that, you know, transgender people want certain pronouns or want to serve in the military, you know, or that a woman, you know, doesn't have to be in a workplace and hear rape jokes or her boss, ask her out. You know, these things matter. And it scares me how much certain folks in the progressive movement are not introspective enough on, you know, the issue of, you know, maybe I'm not taking this seriously enough. Maybe my privilege is kind of blinding me to this. Doesn't make you a bad person. You know, it doesn't make, you know, having privilege doesn't make you a bad person. But when you're, when you're aware that you have privilege and you willfully ignore it, that does make you an enormous asshole. It really does. I can't think of a better way to put it. I was just funny. I was just talking actually, so I did an interview for Barbara Boxer's podcast, which was interesting. Everyone has a podcast, including every former senator. But she was asking me, she was actually kind of adorable, because she was like, you're a young person. Tell me about young people getting involved in politics. And I'm like, I'm 45. And she's like, you're young to me. It must have been a little good, though. Yeah, I didn't know it felt great. But she was talking about the young people in politics thing. And I was like, well, I'm actually Gen X. And I kind of did this like sort of thumbnail history, which included pointing out that when I talk about Gen X, I actually am talking about largely like white middle class people, right? That our stereotype of Gen X is this fear is actually a smaller cohort of a whole generation, you know, and but I can speak about that white middle class experience and that we aren't actually super involved in electoral politics. I mean, we were getting more so, but, you know, our our affect for whatever reason, and partially like the media we grew up in, the economic climate we grew up in, we're pretty, we're much more throw spitballs from the back of the class, in our approach, which I think, you know, worked for the Bush era, for sure, right? Like that was, you know, John Stewart way of looking at the world. It was definitely like my won't get way of looking at the world is like, uh, you know, God, you know, politicians roll eyes, make jokes. But that that has not translated well, right? And I actually feel like I look to younger people because I throwing spitballs from the back of the class is no longer the appropriate approach. No, it's really not. It is you have to be up there in front raising your hands, you know, uh, like Reese Witherspoon in election, right? You got to be just be there and not be afraid of appearing earnest, uh, not be afraid of of of really wanting something. Like I really actually want something, not a kind of like, Oh, that'd be nice or wow, you're weird for wanting something, you know, right? Like, what, what the hell is that? I don't understand it. I think you're right. Why is it bad, you know, that, um, I don't know, it's just this, this very strange thing where it's become uncool in some circles to care a lot about something and to show that you care about it. Yeah. Um, you talked about, you know, being part of Gen X and, you know, you know, you lived through the nineties and it was this, um, you know, really interesting. I mean, I'm not saying it was perfect, but you had an economic boom and, you know, there were certainly issues that you had to worry about, but we could rely mostly on government knowing what the hell they're doing. Yep. Um, and then, you know, Bush comes in and things kind of start to fall apart pretty rapidly. And what I've noticed and I've seen this in myself, by the way, I am not innocent of this at all, is that those of us with privilege and especially those of us with white privilege, you know, we kind of discovered all of a sudden that, oh yeah, uh, black citizens are getting, um, you know, uh, murdered by police for no reason, uh, and being incarcerated at higher rates. Um, you know, those of us with male privilege that, you know, women are, you know, being raped at disproportionate rates on college campuses and sexually harassed in the workplace, not getting paid, you know, not for what they do. And there's all these things that I think points to a frustration among those who don't have that privilege and haven't had the kind of privilege that insulates them from the world's problems that are, you know, deep in the nitty gritty. And so we kind of get defensive. So, you know, when, when I think the thing I've seen most of all is the 47% figure, right? 47% of white women. I don't know. I'm sorry. It's the opposite. 53% of white women voted for Trump. Yeah. I say it's and women of color have rightly brought that up many times. And then, you know, they're not saying, you know, you, they're not saying you're a bad person because you're white. They're saying you're not being actively engaged. If you know white women who voted for Trump and yet you're not using your privilege and access to them to change their minds. And they're absolutely right. Like how much, you know, how much have I reached out to, you know, folks back home in Texas that I know, to ask them aggressively, like, you know, why are you supporting this, you know, awful person? Okay. Well, Charlotte, hold on just one second because you personally, I would say you get a little bit of leeway because we don't want people to, you know, be aggressive about asking for accountability if it puts them in any kind of personal danger. Sure, sure, sure. So I wouldn't want you calling up your most like bigoted Texas relatives, maybe like, you know, like, you know, you know best. Right. I'm sorry. Yeah. I'm just telling you personally, because I care about you, like, I don't think it's your responsibility to call the most, you know, people who will listen to you. Yes, you should. You know, but we know who that is. I appreciate that. You know, like, we do. Oh, we definitely know who that is. No, that's a, that's a really good point. I, and I probably should have profficed that like, if you don't put yourself in an unsafe situation, don't take on labor that, you know, you shouldn't be taking on, but if you can, if you have the space, if you have the space and privilege, then you should. If it's always going to do is hurt someone's feelings or make for an uncomfortable moment or two, then go for it. Like, yeah, absolutely. If all your risk is whether or not you, you're going to get a coffee invite next week, then maybe go ahead. If you're going to get snubbed at the, the block barbecue, right? Right. Well, anyway, I really appreciate you coming on, Charlotte. I am, you know, we've, we've talked on the phone. We've, we've, you know, we're Twitter friends, but I feel like, you know, actually, you know, now we're friend friends. And I just appreciate the work you've done. I appreciate the fact that you are out and living your life and, and being visible to other people that may not have a lot of other visible trans people. Again, the thing about trans people is that we have no idea really how many there are. So let's everyone be careful about what you think, you know, we don't make assumptions. But being visible is really important. Do you be okay if I give a, a parting thought real quick? Because I want to kind of cover my own ass and that of other people. You know, I really appreciate folks who've listened to this and considered what I had to say, but just know that listening to me on this podcast does not give anyone a license to walk up to your transgender friend and be like, please teach me about these things. Right. You know, Google, Google it if you have to look up resources on HRC.org or Lambda Legal or the transgender law center. You know, put the labor on yourself. Don't put it on your trans and on binary friends. And don't assume their lives are just like mine. And because they're likely not, they go through a different set of struggles than I do. So just want to put the point that out real quick. There are lots of books people have written books. So many books, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, Janet Mock has written a couple, like four, maybe three, which she's a wonderful writer. And so yeah, read and all you need to do with your trans friends is just not be an asshole. That's not being asshole. And I do that with all your friends. Just don't be a, you know, asshole. I'm trying to not usually have word on here, but we don't have FCC to worry about. So, you know, let's go for it. Don't be a fucking asshole. Don't be a fucking asshole people. And I think we're the title for our show. Anyway, and thank you for all you do, by the way, thank you for the visibility that you give out to other people. And you know, the fact that you do try to bring folks on this show who may not get that kind of visibility. I mean, just, I really appreciate that. I know others do too. Now a bit of super fan housekeeping. In last week's closing episode, I mentioned that some of the enthusiastic, but critical feedback to our Starbucks episode kind of put me in a bit of an existential tailspin. And I want to be super clear about this. That is on me, not on those who were giving honest, but maybe negative reactions to the show. Please do not mistake my using that criticism as a way to beat myself up as a plea to not criticize the show. I think one of the absolute coolest things about what I do, what we do here is knowing that this show makes a difference in people's lives. That's a gift and a privilege. And it's also a responsibility. Because if I'm going to presume that you take me seriously, I'm going to take you seriously too. And if I want to have an impact on your life, sometimes it might be an impact that I wasn't hoping for. So, you know, feedback is welcome at with friends like pod at gmail.com. That said, it is always easier to hear people's criticisms when they come framed with care and respect. So, you know, be nice. And I would say that goes for any criticism you might have for anyone. And you can also send any questions you might have to that address with friends like pod at gmail.com. I hope everyone takes care of themselves this week. You deserve it. See you next Friday."
