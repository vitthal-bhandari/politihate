Hey this is your first time listening we're very serious here all the time. All right so get serious. This is CTI that stands for Cruz the Internet all right what we're gonna do today is we're gonna put up topics on the screen we're gonna talk about them we're gonna speculate on what's true what may not be true and then we're gonna come up with some opinions of action that we can all take as individuals to help solve some of these problems going on in the world now other times you tune in you might be surprised to find out that this is actually an entrepreneurship business personal development show and you're probably asking yourself why do we talk about what's going on in the world if most of the content is geared towards winning in personal development and building your business well because you can't plant seeds where the soil is not fertile and if we don't have fertile soil of freedom to plant our entrepreneur seeds in there is no entrepreneurial fruit and some of you guys have trouble understanding this concept so if you tune in other times you're gonna get different kinds of shows they're all gonna have to do with you getting better we have Q&A F that's where you get to ask questions and we give you the answers now you could submit your questions a couple different

usually these people have done extraordinary things we let them tell their story we talk about how these ordinary people have done extraordinary things and how you could do extraordinary things as well and then other times we have real talk real talk is just five to twenty minutes of me kind of ranting and what I think needs to be said and sometimes we have 75 hard verses and that's where we bring people on if you guys didn't know I do have this program it's not very popular at all it's called 75 hard and if you're interested in it you go to episode 208 on the audio platform and check it out it's free but we bring people on who have used that program to reclaim control of their life and kick ass and become better humans and we talk about that how you can do it too so that's the show that's the rundown of the show and then we have this thing that we call the fee you're gonna notice that I don't do ads I don't do red ads I don't take money from sponsors I finance the show myself

helpful for you guys in your business careers we ask you to share the show you know a lot of you guys messaged like man where have you been or I just find out about you or you know this message should be heard by everybody well that's up to you guys okay so if we do a good job please share the show if we don't do a good job don't share it it's real simple so that's the fee when I say pay the fee that's what I mean all right so what's up man what's going on guys nothing you guys some more weird shit you want to do bro so what's going on with you man so busy yeah so the biggest thing you've got going on right now that we got to talk about is the book release that you just had yep let's talk about the book we're day seven in the book prepared a manual for surviving worst case scenarios it's about a two-year project but I hear you know guys hit me up all the time like I want to do something like this and like invest 20 years of your life doing the thing and then come to the table and be prepared to do that thing right so really cool I'm very humbled and honored that Penguin random a big publisher picked me up and it took a long time to kind of get things dialed in but we released at June 6 on D-Day I didn't post about the book on D-Day because I feel like that's disrespectful that wasn't even chosen by me by the way yeah if people ask me like oh you're dropping on D-Day that's awesome and then I get you're dropping on D-Day that's kind of like screwed up I'm like every book drops on Tuesday yeah and they gave me a book a date of June 6 or like July whatever and I was like this is the appropriate day let's drop it and here we are seven days into it that's awesome how's it going so far so good I don't know how the book world works yeah right did you hit the list and and to be honest I want to hit the list I'm not going to say that I don't want to hit the New York Times list because that's a profound thing for a writer which means you get position to broader broadly influence that's why I want to hit the list what what is like give people a basic rundown of the book because I think this is a book that is very useful for anybody who is thinking about what could go wrong right because like dude it's overwhelming there's tons and tons of shit that you know you have all these people out there saying you got to do this you got to do that you got to do this and it's like fuck dude I can't be prepared unless I go out and buy a thousand acres and grow my food and have water stored for five years like it's it's a lot and you know what I think is cool is you're making it you're making it accessible and and easy to understand for people yeah we call disaster and equal opportunists right doesn't care your wealth bracket your political affiliation it will hand you your ass the same and so when I started this company I actually said to myself if I can get like a liberal in San Francisco to come out of his dwelling and go hey man this stuff is like reasonable like I want to take care of my family I want to be self-reliant I want to be independent then this applies to you right so it's not an extreme fringe of preparedness it's like reasonable things that you could apply to your everyday life an example in the pillars of preparedness as I define it I have seven pillars for intangibles these are things like situation awareness decision point planning a resilient mindset those things you can't like pay for a course to get but there are tactics right there are things that you could do when I talk about resilient mindset for example I was talking about your boy right here walking in I ain't seen you guys in what couple months it's been a while and then I see him and I'm like dude he's like where he used to be stacked down here he stacked you took all that and put it on top of his shoulders he must be quietly working he's doing something on the snake that's what that is what the fuck are you doing I was on a more so I didn't to twinkies just one now dude I've been doing some rocks at home yeah but the he was something didn't move but you look good he looks amazing yeah and I see that and I go well he's building resilience in his life now if you ask about tools and tactics like we recommend things like instead of focusing on it EDC as your pistol because you think that's being prepared when statistically it's improbable versus being healthy and well following a protocol like 75 hard and getting fit it's like that should be the focus so when people read it I've already got the feedback where they're like dude I thought it was gonna be like how to shoot move and communicate like an operator like guys one my my field of experience is very narrow I can tell you how to plan an operation I'm very good at that counter terrorism all the things but when it comes to this idea preparedness it takes SMEs it takes subject matter experts from every field which there's a there's a time in place for every expert to be conduit to a consumer who's like how do I get prepared we make the recommendations it's like go to 75 hard do the program build resilience in your life and that's what it is it's a protocol and structure so people can wrap their head around it and then what I hope that does it plants the seed and when they're done they go and like I want to I want to live this lifestyle because you can't make it a hobby it's like it's like trying to be healthy and fit as a lifestyle and you go to the gym two times a week right that's a hobby it needs to be part of an integrated element in your life and that's a lifestyle that's a culture and that's what we want yeah bro that's cool I think a lot of this idea of prepping really gets tarnished because you know it gets made out to be this like extremist thing you know you have to be some sort of like far right survivalist extremist to like even pick up a book and read but I think it's important for everybody no matter where you live whether it be inside the urban areas especially if you live in the urban areas I think to the counties to the to the rural areas you know to have some sort of idea of what to do because look man I think we're as close to disorder as we've been it's in my life and civil civil real civil disorder I think you know we have these situations like riots and things that happen right but I'm talking like total mass breakdown because dude if this if this conflict with with China goes a few steps further bro they're gonna start shutting down our shit and and the way things it appears to be is that our own government might shut down our shit and tell us it's China so we don't know but here's what we do know it's uncertain and we should be prepared and so I would appreciate personally if you guys would go support Mike's book where where would be the most helpful place to buy it Amazon Barnes and Noble your local book story it's it's out and about so anywhere that you can find books I would recommend the audible component a jack car he wrote the ford for my book set in the stage it's all downhill from there when jack car write your ford it's all downhill and he and Ray Porter who the voice the voice of terminalist did the voice and I did the voice for for my book but it's it's a good read it's short it's a couple hundred pages it's five and a half hours yeah and everywhere books are found it's there I went Barnes and Noble and Missoula and in uh in Wyoming and found it Barnes and Noble in the new nonfiction section there we go yep so guys show mics from support you know get yourself a copy or two maybe get one for yourself one to gift and let's uh let's help them get on that list all right it's fucking cool you're doing that bro I appreciate it thanks for the support yeah I've grown the other list right huh yeah well we're already on that list not that list we're already on that one touching yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah fuck the weiners are touching on that list man holy shit all right so what's going on DJ well guys we got a lot of interesting things going on out here remember if you want to see any of these pictures articles links videos go to AndyFussella.com you can find them linked there or you can drop down in the youtube description below and find these articles linked here um so before we get into our main topics I have to bring something up okay uh Mike CIA operative right you've seen some cool shit you've done some cool shit right um and I gotta ask you this question um in fact our subscribers on youtube have been meaning them they've been asking this question left and right um so we got to talk about it I got to bring it up Mike the question is do you believe in aliens oh 100 percent you know what I actually have a theory that I've developed in the shower this morning which means it's like clear oh this guy's gonna be clear this guy is gonna be good yeah aliens right now all the evidence and the things that we're seeing right now the whole world is shook social discourse the world is falling apart because we're eating each other alive and when you think about the saving grace it would be aliens it'd be Independence Day because that's the only thing that could bring us together against a common enemy besides looking at ourselves as enemy so sure I there's something going on and I don't know if that's deliberate and intentional like we're releasing the information a little bit at a time but I certainly believe after all the things that I've seen in behind you know behind the curtain of the CIA and special operations there certainly is 100 percent aliens that exist okay well I'm glad we got that because I don't know if you guys have seen this shit going on in my theories I know you got fucking theories I know we talked about it now on the show okay what do you think they want to hear my theories do you believe in aliens Andy this is how it goes it's abandoning me we get my glover here let's get Andy in here Andy is there a theory there yeah I have it is that I'm glad you asked so so my theory on this is that have you guys ever heard of intelligent intervention so there's a book called intelligent intervention it's very hard to find and my buddy Damon West put me on to it all right who boo Damon West huh no no no no they west this fucking speaker who spoke spoke Arteh not fool boo you went to prison oh gotcha yeah oh okay all right so anyway turn me on to it and I stood I think what happened real talk and I'm fucking Rogan knows way more like I think these motherfuckers came here like 12,000 years ago where we believe is the beginning of humanity and like altered the course like said okay here's some stuff you need to know this is what you need to do because when I watch these shows like if you read that book it's iope it's fucking iope like they have like symbols of spacecraft etched into stone from 12,000 years ago and then you look at these structures where there's you know a block that's millions and millions and millions of pounds and they're structured in an actual structure and if you go back to ancient Samaria that's where generally historians say that the first people came from which is like Iraq right mm-hmm well anyway this book kind of outlines how the aliens came here and guided like all the different tribes of people all over the world to like evolve and and dude I don't think there's any denying it because when you follow the course of history and the evolution of technology it's like these people were evolving back then with no communications across continent right in the exact same ways so it's very it's like I think that a lot of our I think a lot of our understanding of what is really happening is a complete one yeah like complete like I think they don't tell us I think they want us not to know I don't even think they want humans to know their own capabilities I think they they make people think that you know you know like this thing they tell us like oh well you know we only know what 10 percent of the brain does you know hemicubins only only use 10 percent of their brain what the fuck is the other 90 percent for how do you know I only use to it bro but if they told you that would you ever like when they tell you that do you ever think like oh well I wonder what the other well they said that the 90 percent doesn't do anything so they just for people forget about it and I actually believe that a big part of human capacity is able to manifest things into reality through your thoughts and I think they don't want you to know that because if everybody knew that and they knew it as truth the world will look completely different and it would be impossible for humans to actually rule over other humans you see what I'm saying so I think there's a lot that we don't know and I think that you know what they're releasing now like you were saying Mike I think that's just to take distraction away from all the shit that they're getting caught doing well I mean there's definitely things that have come out documents you know things talked about Project Bluebeam yeah right like have you heard about Project Bluebeam yeah you know so I mean there's things like that I don't I don't know there's two versions of Project Bluebeam right there's the version that it's aliens so Project Bluebeam is basically a conspiracy theory that they use holographic technology to create alien invasion so that people get scared right and scare them into control or to actually create the second coming of Jesus Christ so there's that yeah for sure yeah but there is a lot going on and I wanted to bring this up because I don't know if you know this Independence Day is playing on HBO right now for free so you know I'm gonna ask for something there yeah that's the thing man right and so I don't know if you guys have seen this but this came out of Las Vegas recently so this Daily Mail article reads headline reads Las Vegas UFO mystery deepens as cops install high-tech surveillance cameras at home where residents reported seeing 10 foot aliens with large shiny eyes so the article kind of dives into it so it reads the Las Vegas UFO mystery has deepened as police installed high-tech cameras outside the home where residents reported seeing 10 foot aliens with large shiny eyes Doug Papa a former police officer who has been following the story of the mysterious object falling from the sky said it baffled him when the Las Vegas police department placed surveillance cameras outside he interviewed the family who made the call and they told him that the cops installed the camera to quote protect them from UFO fanatics who might bother them despite being skeptical Papa who is a podcaster said he believes the family is somewhat credible police body cam footage captured a suspected UFO sighting in Las Vegas after residents reported seeing 10 foot aliens with large shiny eyes in their backyard a Vegas officer's camera picked up the object at about 1150 pm on April 30th after a resident reported something quote 100% not human on their property local tv channel eight news now reported the footage shows a bright blue ball of light traveling through the dark sky at speed here is the video it's a scene straight out of the ex-files a family in Las Vegas insisting something is out there after allegedly having a close encounter of the third kind i swear to god this is not a joke one witness calling 911 after they say an object fell out of the sky and landed in their backyard they're like night food they're like aliens to us big eyes they have big eyes the mysterious object that fell from the sky even the officers apparently saw that the green glow of the alleged human that the green glow of the alleged UFO is seen on this newly released body camera footage i have butterflies bro everyone saw a shooting star then these people said there's aliens in their backyard so when that 911 call came in less than an hour later police were ready to believe it it was like a big creature a big creature yeah like a long time to talk because i'm not going to be asked you guys one of my partners said they saw something fall out of the sky too so that's why i'm kind of curious did you see anything land in your backyard or but after a brief investigation of the yard officers closed the case as unfounded it does it does nine foot beans come back don't call us all right deal with it yourself i ain't dealing with that according to former intelligence officer david grush an alien crash landing isn't too far fetched grush recently turned over documents to congress claiming the u.s. government has a vast collection of vehicles that have non-human origin andrew dembert abc news new york and here's a copy of the police report from that incident a real thing it was definitely documented um but let's get into david grush right so so david grush started 14 years in the air force where he says he was told about the program by others who were involved grush he's 36 years old a decorated afghanistan combat officer who went on to work for the national geospatial intelligence agency and the national reconnaissance office his role was to act as the inro's representative when dealing with the unidentified aerial phenomena task force task force was specifically set up to investigate ufos um what i mean yeah i just don't i mean does this change much of what you guys you guys personal theories i have a theory about our evolution as humans and how it ties into alien but like i mean does this change anything i think it's no coincidence that these things are starting to be publicized considering the turmoil that's going on with all the other things um i personally feel that a lot of the reason that some of these stories are making the news now is because they're trying to distract people from looking at the things that are going on with joe biden in terms of him being found um to have been taking money from other governments for policy policy decisions over the course of many years and we're talking many millions and millions of dollars um and like i've been saying on the show i don't think that they're going to stop and this if this doesn't work it'll be something else they'll progress it further and further and further and i think we're at a point now where the the harder they push some of this shit the less people are going to believe them at all um and basically just move completely away from the media being credible in any way shape or form i mean i mean that's my best take on what's going on with the alien shit yeah i i think the same thing i look i that 14 year veteran who was the whistleblower on that project he said that existed um i have worked for the nro the national reconnaissance organization out of all the agencies that i work with the nro scares me the most the nro handles all the satellite systems that conduct surveillance across the globe and track intercontinental ballistic missiles that's open the open source version of it but those dudes are able to see and track everything that takes place in our country and on this earth and that's pretty scary so it's like the nro is the closest thing you're gonna get to a a deep state's action arm and so when i see this i go okay what's his intent you know what what's his task and purpose like why is he doing this and i tend to agree with Andy on this because look the the whole Biden payments the whole trump thing that's going on right now where he was just indicted on federal charges which has never happened in our country's history when you see all the distraction they understand the algorithm and how national media works how messaging and propaganda works and they understand what to message in order to keep the american people distracted and keep them focused on instagram comment post that's all they could do in their echo chambers but they can't get to the national level they can't influence people across the spectrum and so that's kind of scary when i look at the every morning i wake up because i do a a show called prep life on my my personal channels when i wake up every morning i look at national media headlines and i don't look for what they're putting out i look for what they're not putting out right and so i understand like hey what's real news well real news is biden's um and his sons and his families hundreds of millions of dollars even though it was a 10 million r payment divided into two one for the big man as it as it was reported and one for uh the son with 17 different federal accounts that the the banks submitted a complaint saying this is what racketeering looks like and that's not talked about national media headline news then i go oh what are they put in the news to get people's attention and eyes because there's something that else that's being passed under the buck and that's what's scary i i think that propaganda machine is so good at doing what it's doing they used to do it in the the 90s and 2000s with hollywood and influencing the masses and we see how that worked out for us as a country now and they're going to continue to do it with mainstream media into the election cycle and it's going to be scary yeah i also think that it's not just aliens that are to distraction i think this thing with the tranche it i think they want everybody arguing about this tranche it where it affects literally less than 1% of the population real life okay and ignore the crime in the inner cities ignore the migration that's happening which is actually an invasion okay and to look and argue over this thing and this is one of the things i get so frustrated with um with some of the patriotic or you know i think there's a difference between patriotic influencers and conservative influencers in my mind pro-freedom and conservatism are not necessarily the same thing um but it gets to be frustrated because they constantly buy into the fake outrage well i don't think it's fake i think it's real people are fucking sick of it yeah but they buy into the outrage uh that the media tells them to be outraged and they they they are unable to recognize holy shit we're falling into this they were doing exactly what they want and this is like you could see this in the rise of racially charged comments on both sides coming from black america towards white america and white america towards black america and none of that shit's okay like we have to remember who the fuck we are and what this country is about this country isn't meant for just one race of people no matter who that race is and we come from all different backgrounds we work together we build something great that we can be proud of and part of being proud of it is knowing that we built it from people and with people who are different than us i mean that's one of the biggest senses of pride that i think uh we as a country need to get back to right like that's what makes america america and every time that people buy into these outrage narratives whether it be a shooting or whether it be a riot or whether it be police violence or whether it be the trans thing or whether it be aliens we're pawns in their game and that's that's where people are failing to connect and i think the main thing that we can do to subvert their efforts to propagate us is by not complying and not getting outraged about fucking anything and keeping taking a pause and saying now man they're trying to get us not to notice this and we start talking in those terms they lose all their power they lose all of it and that's that's where we need to get to and that's going to come down to you know people forgiving people for some of the things they did to each other during covid or maybe five years before that or 200 years before that so that we can save our asses now that's my opinion so so you guys are saying it's safe to just stamp distraction on me i say that's why i think i'm not saying it ain't real i think it's very real i think a lot of things are real that they haven't told us about i also think a lot of things that they told us about are not real um some of those things that you can't even mention without people getting completely fucking outraged you know so we still have a lot of deprogramming left to do it's one of the things i like about what rfk is saying uh in his campaign you know he's running as a democrat you know i don't even think he i think he understands that he's not going to be president and i think he understands that by him running for president they're not allowed to really fuck with them in terms of like the laws of censorship and how it's a great strategy right and he's running an entire campaign of disclosure because he understands that you know his family directly has been one of the most victimized families of non-disclosure ever his uncle was killed by our own fucking government so i i think he's got a personal interest to disclose some of the shit that we've all been thinking is true and here's what's going to suck like people like us who are like man you know they're not telling us all this shit there's still a whole lot of people that believe that everything on the news is real they believe that everything that they tell us is real like when you question like when i question this shit on the show like bro i get people from you know like literally people still messaging me being like bro you're insane you're a moron you're this you're that it's like bro i haven't fucking missed in three fucking years okay i missed on two things i know exactly what they are and i i own it but the point is we still have a lot of deprogramming to do and and like bro it's going to be hard for people and like if the truth does come to fruition and we declass what's the fuck has been actually going on in the actual history of humanity it's going to be a lot for people to fucking swallow it once 100 but i think it's going to cause less mental illness than the shit they're propagating with us now bro like i mean bro like you know they're convincing everybody now that men can have babies and women are men and all this like it's fucking confusing is fuck like think about teaching that to a child you know what i mean yeah like i just rather know the truth like i want to know what the fuck's going on like where do we sit in the the uh intergalactical hierarchy you know what i'm saying like are we fucking bacteria right we're doing pretty good like do we need to worry about you know like this fucking fake freedom like facade for me personally is it's it's it's it's almost more excruciating than being literally ruled over because it's like bro you're making me believe that i'm free when i'm not really fucking free and it drives me insane you know so i don't that's real man well uh let's keep cruising let's keep this uh because this cruise chain train going uh well headline number one now

and they asked if uh they could use the restroom and the employee told them that the restroom was for the paying customers only which is a common practice at most establishments right um and uh and then after that they were actually they refused to leave then the police were called they were arrested for trespass um so that's the full story um now this miss phillips lady uh she the article says uh she miss miss phillips who oversaw the location as well as about 100 other locations uh would have been paid up to about two hundred thousand dollars a year was fired uh was quickly fired but in 2009 sued the coffee chain claiming it was due to racial bias um so following her victory on monday her loyal lower uh carlin manikachi uh said they were very pleased with the unanimous verdict she said that she quote uh she proved by clear and convincing evidence that punitive damages were warranted under the new jersey law um she claims that straw buck started punishing white employees who weren't involved weeks later in a bit to publicly prove they were handling the incident miss phillips alleges the firm ordered her to put a white male manager who had worked for the company for 15 years on administrative leave because of a race discrimination allegation against him the allegation was based on complaints non-white employees at the manager's store were paid less than white workers miss phillips said she argued the male manager didn't have a say in wages the lawsuit also said miss phillips objected to suspending him because she said the manager wasn't racist and she had never seen him exhibit discriminatory behavior she argued in comparison the black manager of the store where the arrest were carried out did not face any disciplinary action um charges were dropped on both men um article continues saying the two black men ended up reaching a settlement with starbucks in the aftermath for an undisclosed sum in an offer of a free college education they were both 23 years old at the time separately they reached a deal with the city for a symbolic one dollar each and a promise from officials who set up a two hundred thousand dollar program for young entrepreneurs but we thought long and hard about it and we feel like this is the best way to see that change that we want to see uh mr. Robinson said at the time um now a couple of thanks to mentions before we discuss on this i pulled up uh some of the crime maps going on in philadelphia at that time so in 2018 uh there was 353 homicides in philadelphia a 12 increase from 2017 uh this app uh the data that i'm pulling and maps the victims of gun violence there was 1147 non-fatal gun shootings uh 302 fatal shooting victims and that was just in 28 uh 2018 um where you know so so almost 80 when i fatal um 84 of those uh victims their cases never went anywhere their code cases 91 of the victims were male um 83 were black and uh more than half were in the age range of 18 to 30 and we can see in the last uh 10 years homicide rates are rising in philadelphia uh crime shots are everywhere right um and they are i thought you weren't allowed to talk about crime oh no we could talk about them oh it's real AF right yeah i just right thought that we just forgot about those yeah you know and and like you know but i i want to say this too this is one of my favorite pieces so they they they use this photo of the two gentlemen right and just like off that i what are we noticing what's those so let's paint the picture for audio listen so it has uh russian and dant\u00e9 the sitting on this nice little couch and behind them is just this wall of degrees and uh certifications and accommodations um well this picture was just taken at the lawyer's office this is all the law uh the lawyer's uh accommodations and degrees and things like that's trying to make them you know paint them up looking like nice young standing men well they might be they might not be well i don't know do you know oh i know why i mean i like dude i don't have problem with this picture no but let me behind saying like you know okay let's hear the rest well i mean it's just it's not me that that's pretty much it it's just the this the standard image that they try to paint like these were upstanding citizens and they're like guys at the end of the day black white yellow brown blue don't fucking matter the law is a law if you're asked to leave a place you have to leave it's called trespassing right you don't just get to say no i'm not doing it right like it is what the fuck it is i don't i don't believe this thing had anything to do with color i didn't have it like bro like you i don't know if you last time you guys been into fucking starbucks we know who runs starbucks right like these aren't fucking white conservatives that are running these locations right they're all pink and blue-haired you know typically leftist right that operate these starbucks i don't believe there was any type of racial prejudice what's so fucking ever but you know again anything they can use the time i mean bro i've been told many a times coming up through my life like where i used to have meetings and places like that and people are like well this is for paying customers i mean it's a common thing yeah it's very common it's a common thing man i just hate how the the spin so i mean like again it's just one of those things well remember too also bro i think i think also when this happened things were very different in the in the social environment you know like for a long time and you know people you guys can get fucking pissed about this but this is reality if you're white you can't say shit about anything like that's why i made the joke about the fucking crime stats like you can't point the crime stats because you're racist you can't even fucking say someone is black oh what do you what do you got something against black people no i'm just pointing out a fucking fact of the matter and we see this in the media right we see the media make tell these stories bro we're even seeing the media do this shit now where they're marking the fucking migrants that commit the crimes as fucking white yeah have you seen that like yeah drive the white crime data oh yeah like bro there's a complete bias against fucking white people it's part of the democrat narrative right now it's another one of the distraction division tactics and it's bullshit and the truth of the matter is um the reason that we because i'm not going to sit here and say that black americans inner city americans have it fucking the same as everybody else because they fucking don't but the reason that they fucking don't is because the people that they continue to vote for intentionally create hardships on them over and over and over again to maintain the control of their vote power so they can come in every two and four years and say hey you know what fucking white dudes over there they fucked up all your shit look at your neighborhood they did all this stuff they stole your funding they won't give you the money they won't do this when in reality you guys elect them meaning black people that you elect them they go to washington they make more palaces to figure out how to fuck the fucking black neighborhoods and treat them like shit and then blame it on the other guy and like that's what we've been going on for 50 fucking years and so if we're going to have some real talks about real solution this absurd shit that we cannot state facts of the matter when a black man commits a crime uh you know we have to be able to say hey we have 83 percent of the shootings that are happening in this area are committed by black males between the ages of 18 30 years old that's a statistic that's a fact that's not something you could argue or pretend doesn't exist and if you want it solved which all people should especially black people we have to acknowledge that that's a problem so how do we fix it and that's where the conversation needs to go in my opinion you know this shit we're like I bro personally I think race is fucking stupid that's just my personal opinion you know like I think I think it's uh I think it's things that you know we should be in my opinion America should celebrate the cultural diversity in a real way people who who come from different countries who have their customs and their their way of life those things should be celebrated but I also think there's an American culture that comes before all of that that everybody should buy into and be a part of and then we can celebrate the traditions and say oh this is a cool tradition outside of my culture I like that that's cool this is what we do in our people this is what they do in their people and we have all these different kinds of people it could actually be pretty cool but because of these assholes in the media in Washington we can't even get along for a fucking day because we can't even point the real problem and why wouldn't they want us to talk about the real problem why wouldn't they want us to acknowledge the crime data and say this is what's actually happening the reason is is they don't want the problem to be solved because it serves them and so you know I don't know bro like those dudes didn't seem like they did anything wrong and like but the reality is is you know like you said if a car if a place says hey you got a you got to be a paying customer to hang out here no no lawyer lawyer lawyer right now you say it whatever anything towards a mask yeah no lawyer how I can't say the word let me do it hanging around motherfuckers all right let me here's the thing they had no problem kicking us out and lock us in lock us lock us lock us up if we didn't wear a mask in these fucking places nobody fucking kicked me out anywhere you know what I'm saying like oh I'm just saying I mean we saw those videos all over the fucking place right there was no protest for those I can't see um I mean I can't see the population of people who are frequenting star books in the inner city of Philadelphia being a lot of white people period I mean it's yeah it's not like like the demographic is is not outside the ordinary this was in Utah be a lot different this is in Philadelphia I grew up in Daytona Beach in North Carolina and my my family my grandma who raised me as a kid lived on the black side of town by Bethune Cookman College I mean right down the road and and I mean it was everybody was black except me and my grandma and my dad and when I grew up in that yeah when I grew up in that um when I used to play basketball down the road all the black kids because I was the only pale skin dude used to call me Wonderbread and and it was like what the hell was Wonderbread it's like oh it's white bread I'm like but I'm not white right like I don't want to I'm not like a white guy like I don't look like a white guy like we bread at least yeah we let me get some mix some poppy seeds something some artisan bread and so when I grew up you're that swirl brand swirl swirls right um so when I'm predicting so so growing up I understood kind of segregation on we lived on the other side of MLK Boulevard which is all black and my grandma simulated in that environment and my grandma was prejudice I mean I wouldn't call her racist but she was prejudiced and and I remember like the little black girls who were next door running across her lawn and her saying some words that wouldn't be favored today but those same little girls grew up and respected my grandmother they went to her funeral and told everybody how much they love my grandma and so it was a different place back then in the 80s and then fast forward um growing up very diverse my uncle Weaver whose black is like that wall right there no offense Uncle Weaver he's purple um I can say that because he's my uncle right but he met my Korean aunt and we have a very diversified family black Puerto Rican all the things and so when I see stuff like this like Annie said it's all racially charged because we're trying to create a divide and that narrative is created by corporations the national media and at the end of the day what's what is the matter of fact the matter of fact like you said these dudes were loitering they're in a place an establishment if they want to fill crap HQ my business and they sat down at a table and they weren't buying shit I'd be like what's up what are you guys doing like oh we're just hanging out okay you gonna buy something right no get the fucking on my place exactly like if you're gonna buy nothing get out of my fucking yeah and so that's how it works because it's reasonable it's a bit it's reasonable yeah you have an expectation so when I see all this stuff unfold it's all charged what I'm pleasantly surprised from the article and I think as a positive direction is white people in this case getting um discriminated against and actually winning the case in New Jersey yeah that's rare it's a big precedent but but it's a big precedent it needs to happen more often because I mean dude it is it's I look at my race and I'm like I could assimilate with every race I think Annie's in the same boat too he doesn't look like a white guy and so he has the ability to assimilate blacks whites put a rigens and be the neutral race I love the benefit of being that I look at my friends who are straight white and I go dude it sucks to be you right now and and growing up it didn't because nobody focused on race they just focused on character and today we're in a different world and it sucks because everybody like you said is being swayed by a national media narrative and here's the thing like the inner city the inner city where crime is the highest where you know growing up dating chicks in Philly I had a girlfriend who was in Philly and I used to go there was a big shithole and I was coming from Washington DC and like oh my god this is horrible the reason it's that way is because everybody there buys in to the the narrative and they also buy it into the institution they outsource everything in the name of optimization and efficiency except that shit's not working anymore the system you bought into outsource in your health care outsource in your security outsource in your education all those systems are fracturing and nearly broken so it's time to take some of that back when I see dudes like Jay Z and Beyonce who I respected growing up and I love their story and they're up and coming story they're billionaires now and when you look at what they're doing for for for pushing people in the democratic narrative it makes me sick to my stomach and because if there's conservative principles like discipline like character like value that made them what they are and they're pushing people to that narrative who keeps those people suppressed in the inner city they're making them believe that they're victims they make them believe they're automatically automatically that's out the gate yeah that's the that's the main nefarious disgusting point of the agenda is making white people feel guilty for being white and making black people feel like no matter how hard they work or how hard they try or what they do that it's going to be impossible for them to get ahead because it's already hard enough to get ahead no matter who the fuck you are right so like you don't need this thought weighing on your shoulders they understand what they're doing they understand that they are demoralizing an entire generation of black youth from even trying and you know and then they turn to crime and these other lifestyle that we see right but you know I do think it's good that we're seeing this go the other way because I've been saying this on the show for years because it's a matter of fact white Americans are the only Americans that are legally allowed to be discriminated against inside of companies you can not hire someone or not promote someone because they happen to be white even if they happen to be better than the whoever else they're against okay and if that other person happens to be a minority of any race they can get the job just because they are that race over someone who's more qualified who happens to be white and that's not okay right that's not meritocracy that's not what this country was founded upon and it is discrimination and it's always been discrimination exactly it's just been accepted for the last 25 years where and people like a lot of people don't realize this has been going on for a long fucking time you know for for me to even come on here and speak like this about what's going on that would not have like if I would have said this five years ago on my show would have been complete fucking cancel complete cancel dudes are racist dudes are this dudes dude if we don't talk about the facts guys I don't give a fuck what color you are where you come from or what you think of me but if we don't talk about the actual facts how can you solve the problem okay how can we solve the problem of black men killing each other if we can't even say that black men are doing a fucking killing you know what I'm saying and the people who want to fucking acknowledge that statistic the most should be black people you would think you would think man one last little thing I want to pull up on this man because I saw this online and I don't think these guys did anything super horrible bro like these dudes look like they're all right dudes yeah I mean you know that's cool they probably should have been arrested I mean that's kind of I thought so too I thought I thought it and I could from watching that first video real talk like I could see why there was some outrage yeah if you're a cop use common sense when applying these kind of things just like you're here you got to go okay I'm up I'm out yeah like making this a civil rights issue is kind of they forced a hand that's that's the thing and that's what it was because there's another video angle where like it wasn't it didn't just start with you know 10 cops in the fucking Starbucks it started with I think one or two and they asked them like all right guys have been asked leave and they said no they said yeah but DJ that also comes from this belief that we're living through this civil rights renaissance for all that shit has already been happening it's already happened yeah like you are not the civil rights heroes of this fucking country bro that happened in the 60s right and you're not doing a sit-in because they actually leave because they wanted you to buy something you said no it's correct so it's not an appropriate course of action it's not you know like not everything has to be this statement like sometimes you're just an asshole you know what I'm saying like and guess what we've all been it at one time or another we can all we've all been the asshole right you know like sometimes we make it worse by doing things like this 100 percent man I want to show you guys this little thing because I found this online and it's I think it's so important because I think ultimately what this is coming down to is again like what's the task and purpose of these racially charged things right and I and I it truly is division it's divide and fucking conquer right and I saw this post and I want to show you guys this because to me it just it explains what's going on so beautifully and so I read it says if a white person has a list of things so the first thing is it says if a white person moves out it's called white flight and that's called racism the white person moves in called gentrification which is called racism the white person sees color it's racism the white person doesn't see color it's ignoring racism which is racism the white person doesn't partake in culture they're non-inclusive which is racism but if a white person engages in culture it's cultural appropriation that's racism right and it's like you know it's creating uh this this this point in society that I mean dude like yeah I be fucking dangerous man listen it's not that dangerous this only works if you fucking listen to it yeah like bronch give a fuck about none of that shit you say whatever the fuck you want about me I'm gonna live my fucking life you know I'm saying you want to call me a racist from the shit that I say pointing out facts and fuck you that's how I and if more people had that fucking attitude this shit wouldn't be a problem the problem here is that we have a bunch of fucking cowards that don't fucking stand up for themselves and allow themselves to be called things that they know they're not over and over and over again and basically just accept the abuse yeah and this go this can go for any category there's this same chart could be written a different way for other races the same way it's just like bro we have to stop caving the social pressures and start saying you know what uh I I moved out not because of white flight it wasn't because black people moved to my neighborhood I actually just wanted another fucking house you know I moved in because this is what I could fucking afford uh I don't see color because I actually believe in the content of character and judging what MLK fucking preach and you can disagree with MLK all you want but I think he actually preached a tremendous message that embodies America which is why he celebrated as a hero a lot of people said well he was a Marxist well he might have been a Marxist but he's saying a good shit the fucking I think represents what the fuck we're about uh doesn't partake in culture well that's because uh I got my own culture that you guys say I don't have yeah right uh I like hip-hop that's cultural appropriation well mother fuck I don't know what to tell you because that's what I like I call it culturally appropriate yeah like like it's just real easy to like you say like well you know it is what the fucking is bro like if we just all had that attitude and whether that be because black people get this same shit bro in a different way like you get this exact same shit from black people you do no because you stand for conservative value you're more conservative than I am you know a mirror buddy a mirror who is a conservative gay man he's been on the show um bro he gets blasted by the black community this exact same way that like if that said if a mirror up at the top and you went through all the shit they'd say the same shit about him yeah so this is about perpetuating a victim culture class so that certain so a certain class can have power over another class by just naming them a certain thing and this goes into cultural Marxism if you go read about Marxism part of what the strategy is is to shame people to the point where they don't resist and that's what we're dealing with now and all you got to do is just not be ashamed like mother fuck I'm not fucking this or that I'm doing this and you're not to explain yourself bro 90 percent of black people understand this is bullshit too do they not no they're absolutely or at least I mean they're definitely starting to realize it more for sure man guys let's keep this CTI train rolling we got headline number two headline number two reads Biden White House bans topless trans activists for inappropriate behavior at event for LGBTQI plus families we got seen this yeah who hasn't seen this right it's everywhere yeah February so let's dive into this a little bit so the White House I know my dad's seen it I didn't get pissed no but that's like did you see the White House? Was a hot chick with titties on the front? That's a man oh bro keep the same thing bro no he didn't bro I swear to god I had to fucking I'm gonna show you real quick this is what was on my show I told my dad so so listen conversation so sorry

that hot chick with the boobs and I'm like dad that was a fucking that was a man and he's like no yeah and so we had to play the video and I'm like there those are all dudes and then are the women and the women I'd explain it to him oh man hey bro he just got quiet oh he didn't say shit dude no dude he sitting right here next to me he just did the same exact thing so I had this pulled up on my laptop he walks by he was just funny yeah he's like he's like is that like an influencer or something I said well she's a dude so I will say this real talk that's the most feminine looking trans person I've seen for sure still a dude still a dude yeah so let's dive into this so the White House banned transgender activist Rose Montoya after he and other transgender activists flashed their bare chest during the pride celebration at the White House over the weekend Rose Montoya a biological man who believes he is a female what's his article from right bar they're fucking great they ain't playing with the shit they were there not with the shit attended the White House pride event and was featured in a video in which he showcased his fake breast other transgender activists women who believe they are men also flashed their bare chest showing scars from undergoing gender affirmation surgery Montoya covered the nipples of his fake breast as he shimmyed for the camera here's the video welcome to the White House thank you happy pride month right here happy pride life yahh yeah two gender children you are beautiful you are heard you belong understood you are and you belong the bravest and most inspiring people i've ever known and i mean you're welcome good folks can we take a little video hi mr husband she is an honor trans rights with human rights we dropped this at the White House so so after plenty of i did that's so fucking disrespectful dude like take away the fucking take away the the trans movement and shit like we're like we have fucking titties out on the White House lawn bro mockery it is fucking mock yeah real earth fake it's fucked up no that's why that's i think that's the issue yeah that's to me that's the issue this whole thing it's the standard man it's the standard and the continued degradation of our country um but the article continues it says after plenty of backlash across social media the White House told the New York Post quote this behavior is inappropriate and disrespectful for any event at the White House further it said those individuals in the video will not be invited to future events at the White House quote it is not reflective of the event we hosted to celebrate lgbtqi plus families or the other hundreds of guests who were in attendance individuals in the video will not be invited to feature events the statement at it now bro i only just do the whole alphabet like every time they talk about it add something new to it i can reread it can we try it what is the plus though hold on what's the g what's the plus g's gay but it isn't a lesbian that was lesbian yeah the g's for guys yeah but b is it aren't women that are lesbians lesbian gay bisexual yeah i know that but wow hold on what's the plus four plus is for everything else no no it's like the etc yeah it's like it's like whatever we left out it couldn't be like g no the plus you're missing the point of the question what's okay what's the plus four i don't know who's the group of people that they try to hide this community oh the pedophiles that's what it's for correct oh is it i mean like because i mean you can't say minor attractive people in the fucking yeah they can't just put a key and like all the people outside the lgbt community are all with this minor attracted shit not all of them okay but there's more than one yeah more than more than a few yeah um enough to where it's become a term yeah i can read let me read this reread this one more time uh quote it is not reflective of the event we hosted to celebrate abcdefg yeah right yeah i mean it would be fucking mine as well uh but rose montoya she did respond oh shit he did respond uh this was his response video here it has recently come to my attention that conservatives are trying to use the video of me topless at the white house to try to call the community groomers etc and i would just like to say that first of all going topless in washington dc is legal and i fully support the movement in freeing the nipple because why is my chest now deemed inappropriate or illegal when i show it off however before coming out as trans it was not all you're doing is affirming that i am a woman all you're doing is saying that trans women are women because for some reason people like to sexualize women's bodies and say that they are inappropriate now i would like to trans masculine friends were showing off their top surgery scars and living in joy and i wanted to join them and because it is perfectly within the law in washington dc i decided to join them and cover my nipples just to play it safe because i wanted to be fully free and myself i had zero intention of trying to be vulgar or be profane in any way i was simply living in joy living my truth and existing in my body happy pride free the nipple well listen bitch um i thought that's such a great i'm going to tell you something uh you your first your fucking personal beliefs don't supersede uh cultural norms and what people are going to be offended by and not be offended by and i i'm so tired of hearing all of these people talk about the things that they do that are obscene as if expression of myself and that's that makes it okay like sometimes uh you're gonna have to show some self-control sometimes there's things you can't do i can't walk through a fucking mall my dick hanging out and then say oh i was just being free free my shit in jail but if i was a trans person and i walked through the mall with my fucking fake dick hanging out y'all would fucking clap for it okay so there's a double standard here and this is crossing the line for i would say the majority of americans especially the ones who maybe like myself have had family members literally be fucking killed for the fucking country how about all your friends yeah it's disgusting yeah it's it's disheartening too because it's like you don't see this output of resources and you know speaking engagement for veterans or for holidays that involve patriots enjoy that long weekend yeah memorial day i mean did we get this memorial day we got you know Biden like putting across the Arlington national cemetery the two many unknowns to lay the wreath almost looking like he was going to fall over and so when i see this all the resources poured in this americans have to remember they're paying for this and look i have people in my family who are gay and they don't agree with this shit they hate this shit they don't and and one of my cousins who's gay whose husband's in the military um people have to wrap their head around like that shit is that should exist right even if you disagree with it that should exist but the reasonable decent human beings out there that don't throw this shit people's faces and and my thing is like she's saying conservatives are sexualizing the situation no your fake 34 double D's on your man chest pulling them out in public especially in the white house is what's sexualizing the situation and and we wonder why these people are being called groomers when you go out and you try to sexualize children because you want to push your agenda which is your persona it's not your biology it's your persona onto kids and making it their sexuality and they're and trying to change their biology that's where i draw the line and when i see this it's disgusting because it's like this is the white house like take some shit serious you could be a fuck up you can be old man you can be like not taking anything serious but that place like Arlington national cemetery is sacred ground don't fuck that up and he's fucking that up well they're doing that intentionally bro it's like when lizzo came out and played the glass flute all right she uh what's his face his glass flute uh i forgot what president was never been touched never been played they've sent her out like they're trying to destroy American culture and yeah James Madison's glass food okay like it never been played it's in a case who's gonna play it the first time fucking lizzo a fuck out of here you know what i'm saying i mean even the shit with the flags caught a lot of heat right because it should of how they positioned it right next to the american flag like i learned that as a 17 year old private in the army and this you never do that no bro flags if you're going to display the flag and with other flags the american flag is supposed to be higher and center of the other flags yeah well in the response to that was well it's being flown atop the white house and it's like that that's still not what this is referring to it's referring to any time it's grouped with other flags which is what this is you know bro these people are their own worst enemy like like dude nobody truly gives a fuck about how if you want to get some fake boobs and and live as a woman or whatever i don't fucking care and i don't think most people do the problem is like i've said in which most of you have seen because the clip went mega viral uh is these fuckers that are throwing it in our face non-stop bringing in situations that are not appropriate this is not a fucking appropriate okay men dressing up as women and shaking their dicks and balls in front of fucking little kids that's not okay and anybody who supports that that's in this community you're furthering the demise of your own movement okay because it wasn't too long ago where everybody was like gay people shouldn't even be married right and now people are saying fuck we should never let them get married and that's where you're the extreme i don't believe that but i'm saying what that's causing it's causing it would be what's going yes bro and and like dude there's so many gay people who sacrificed a lot a lot of real fucking sacrifice like real persecution to get the rights of of every other american and we were at that place and now this is regressing it because of shit like this and then this person gets on fucking tick talk and acts like they're the victim you're not the fucking victim bro you fucked up you know what you should say you should say you know what i got carried away in the moment i thought that you know my friends were doing it i thought it would be cool and i didn't realize it and you know what it was bad on me it was disrespectful and i apologize if you did that shit people respect the fucking community more but this thing of like completely playing the victim every time it goes back to the shit we were talking about about black crime like we cannot continue to allow the actual facts of what's going on to be swept under the red you were inappropriate own the shit and if you really care about trans communities and trans lives and trans acceptance then act like a fucking great ambassador of trans people don't pull out your titties on the fucking white house lawn where people have fucking lost family members and friends and generations of people have fucking died to have this country like be respectful of it and like dude if she would come out or hear whatever you want to call come out and say what i just said bro it would be a plus for the community another plus yeah no shit two plus guys let's keep this train moving our third and final headline headline number three headline number three reads CNN MSNBC refused to air potentially dangerous trump's speech to supporters dangerous to who right let's be dangerous like that 75 hard so so this is a Fox News article reading both cnn and msmbc refused to air former president trump's speech to supporters following his court hearing Tuesday where he pled not guilty to 37 federal felony counts stemming from his alleged and proper retention of classified records CNN anchor jake tapper defended the decision not to air the speech Tuesday night bluntly telling audiences it could be quote dangerous to do so uh quote bro these motherfuckers don't know what dangerous is they've never seen they now he says quote we're not carrying his remarks live because frankly he says a lot of things that are not true and sometimes potentially dangerous jake tapper tote cnn audiences and guest representative alexandria oscar Cortez out of new york early in the day tapper rebuked cnn producers for showing the former president celebrating with the supporters quote the folks in the control room i don't need to see any more of that tapper grumbled on there quote he's trying to turn this into a spectacle a campaign at that's enough of that tapper went on to warn audiences that cnn would air a clip of trump defending himself that was full of quote untrue and unfounded claims about the charges against him and the people he thinks are behind it uh msmbc anchor rachel mattow announced her network had made the same decision during her Tuesday night show uh quote we are prepared for his pre-fund razor remarks tonight to gain essentially be a trump campaign speech because of that we do not intend to carry these remarks live she began the prime time post suggested that uh suggested this was in order to protect the network's reputation and journalistic integrity uh saying uh quote as we have said before in these circumstances there is a cost to us as a news organization to knowingly broadcast untrue things we are here to bring you the news it hurts our ability to do that if we live broadcast what we fully expect in advance to be a litany of lies and false accusations no matter who says them she explained uh mattow claimed she was not celebrating the decision to censor trump speech and this was not a quote glib decision by the network to reveal they could reverse that that call if trump said anything newsworthy um so we got that and then i don't know if you guys also saw uh you got hillary clinton chime in on this bow trump indictment uh calling it profoundly disturbing uh hillary clinton reacts to republicans defending trump over federal indictment um there's any and like how democrats defending her for all her fucking shit exactly exactly let's let the fuck let's watch this video of uh a good old hillary here here's the video here look at her hold on a point of video place it'll look on her fucking face yeah i like this one here no she looks like the fucking joker from fucking batman she looks like the dude from uh she looks like what's named from the mask she looks like some of these american women need to punch her in a fucking face just figuratively a face of me yeah so let's watch this video here of her uh chiming in on that dude where the fuck is skirt uh i can't i don't know all right first of all fucking just anything goes now did you just assume that to do has that a bud light i think he won the national i think he won the national swimming title every sure yeah let's watch this video guys republicans claim that you got offs you did the same thing and got off scott free why did your friend jim combi let you off so easy that that's a really good question i can't figure that one out um you know i do think it's it's uh odd let's just say to the point of being absurd um how that is their only response you know they refuse to read the indictment they refuse to engage with the facts there's nothing new about that and what they refuse to admit is you know this is on a track about him not about anybody else no matter how much they try to confuse people and how much they try to you know raise extraneous issues um and it's going to be fascinating i guess in a bizarre and sad way to watch them spin themselves up if you watched any of the news programs this weekend i mean their efforts to defend this man are truly beyond anything that i ever thought possible in our country i mean it is so profoundly disturbing how this could have been the break this could have been the opportunity to say you know thank you so much for everything you've done for us we really appreciate it you know but this is kind of serious and so we're not going to you know continue to defend you but no they're all in again that's what the psychology of this is so hard for me to fully grasp uh it shouldn't be that hard motherfucker like you fucking assholes push this shit on everybody every fucking day all day long in a relentless fashion in order and demand us to go with you and believe everything that you believe and you do this every single day for years and years and years and years and years and now most of america most of america believes that this man is being unfairly targeted politically which i believe as well and i think anybody would common sense uh whether they are a republican or democrat knows it's true and you have gotten off doing all kinds of crazy shit including making up a fake fucking document that accused this man of being a russian asset and for seven fucking years you ran with that narrative and fucked our lives up and created division hate destruction all for your own political preservation so here's what you don't understand lady is that the more you fucking go at this man he's like fanos you're gonna throw more energy at him and the motherfucker's gonna absorb it and absorb it and absorb it and when it comes back to you your head's gonna end up on a fucking steak that's reality okay so these people here brought when this tide turns and i'm not advocating for this but i'm just telling you this is the way governments work the pendulum swings one way it swings the other way a little bit harder swings the other way a little bit harder and when trump keeps saying they broke the seal because that's what he was saying what he's actually saying is okay the gloves are off and when i get back in power dude i'm fucking doing whatever i gotta do to get rid of these people that's what he's saying and this and another thing to note about hillary clinton is it not only a shit complete fucking liar and a piece of shit okay and i'm i'm being nice yeah allegedly now i'm being nice okay she is so manipulative and if you watch her and you you got to understand she is completely aware that what she's doing is not she's not voicing her opinion she's actually leading the opinion of the people who fucking are still endeared to her which is less than less by the day so when she says what she says she's not saying she believes that she's saying that's what you should believe and she's trying to rally her people behind that okay but these people are in a fucked situation because you keep in dieting this dude you keep persecuting this dude and you want it to go this other way and you want people to give up and all it's doing is forcing your own people that probably voted for you to believe that we are now living in some sort of third world communist type country and they're like fuck this is bad even though i don't like trump this is really bad and people dude i've heard that from democrats since the shit started when he got indicted in new york like dude you know many democrats have reached out in the dms and they're like bro this is fucking crazy like i don't like trump but this is absurd and this can go really like dude they're getting it and like for her to sit there and say oh i can't grasp it well you can't grasp because people are sick of your shit we don't believe you anymore at all yeah i was thinking to myself i was like uh when he actually like why did why did your friend combi let's you off because i she's how the answer really answer was because i told him i would kill him if he didn't yeah you'd be dead you would have got killeried bro what you got on this i think the biggest issue is no matter what american americans and the citizens of this country are the biggest losers in this because no matter how you campaign whoever gets in the white house in the position they're going to spend the entire presidency their entire administration is going to focus solely on weaponizing the government to go after the other party yeah and nothing gets accomplished that's why all these uh in congress and the senate all these bills are getting passed and nobody's paying attention and that's what's set in the stage for calamity and chaos in the future is because all the wool all the distractions being pulled over eyes and nothing's being accomplished and we will be the victims of that at a latter time so we all losing this which sucks and i agree with any like uh fuck hillary clinton i worked under her when she was sec uh secretary of state during bingazi and i came back um i went to libya in october of 2012 to target abigatala and the shihads who killed uh everybody all the americans an ambassador and we handed over all that information really quickly you sasak did us army special operations command did and they didn't want to do anything about it because they said it was too political of a climate she didn't even say that she actually said what does it matter what does it matter what is it matter what difference does it make right it's like what it that kind of mindset that kind of um politician is the the real weapon of destruction in this country and that's going to implode itself and and i look at the the great reset and and whatever you want to call it i'm thinking like dude the only way you would fuck this is you have to start from scratch you have to start at zero there's no consultant that can come down and start to whittle away you gotta start at zero and build up zero to one and that's a scary outlook but it's the only outlook that saves this country and you know i'm not advocating for civil war here i'm thinking like you got it awards revolutionary war yeah figuratively and literally you got to burn it down yeah and the ashes you find the remnants and then you pick it up that's the only way because no other i mean when the richest people in this country politicians yeah they are they're going to burn it down this is why i keep pushing the culture move like i keep saying personal excellence personal excellence personal excellence individuals unplug yourself from their game yeah become not a non-customer a non-factor for their wealth okay because what's going to be required for us to really rebuild this country is to allow them to burn at the fuck down and write at that key moment where they think they're going to rebuild we fucking rebuild it yep and that's that's why we bring on people like uh michael cifer from public square and creating alternative economy like this isn't just as simple as like a bunch of dudes getting kitted up and fucking doing some work that's the easy part dude and that but what about tomorrow yeah what about the next day what about the next day and that culture that we're talking about consistently on the show personal excellence being the ultimate rebellion that will actually fix things long term when you say build from zero well if we're building the culture as they're burning it down and our culture is strong and we're all independent and we're all fit we're all healthy we're all making money we're all taking care of our families we're all prepared okay when they burn it down now all of a sudden they have a different class of people to actually try and control and those people can say no fuck you we don't fucking need your shit and they won't be able to rebuild the way they're trying to rebuild so like when people try to say oh you know will you say this but doesn't offer solution no it actually is the solution you just not thinking it all the way through yeah you're playing a short game yeah other thing people want there's all kinds of people calling for violence that have never done violence or never really will participate in violence and it's real easy to sit on the bench and say we need to fucking do this and this and this and this all this violent shit but the reality is is dude uh you're outclassed you're outman you're outpowered you're out this you'll get fucking killed so what's the best thing that you can do you can actually build yourself into an individual asset that is not dependent on their systems not just uh you know in every way not just one or two ways and now we're in a situation where whatever move they make it's easy to not comply because we don't fucking need them and if we don't need them they don't have any power which means we can rebuild and they can't but that's the other key point to that that whole thing too it's like you know there's gonna be a lag time in between the rebuild right like i'm with you michael let's burn it down right but like from from from that first match being lit they're burning down well i mean once you're about but i'm like our rebuilding right like yeah the americans rebuild of america right from the from the very instance of that first match being lit to burn down to you know set in the new foundation bringing everything back there's there's amount of time that's gonna span it maybe months might be even be years right where if you have the majority of americans that are not prepared are not uh personally excellent or self-sufficient right like that's only like that's going to make that process much much harder right whereas if you have the majority of american to our prepared our self-sufficient right are mentally tough right and have these things in place healthy earning income to be independent 100 percent securing themselves all this shit it's going to be a lot easier to have that rebuild because there's going to be an amount of time that it's going to take right now i don't know what exactly how long they're there well no that so it's important that we had that you know bro look if you're building it now by the time this shit hits bottom this shit is already built the culture is restored this is a cultural revolution that we need it's not a violent revolution it's cultural what they are doing is not violent they've done cultural that's why the fuck it worked they did it over fucking a hundred fucking years here okay this is a cultural revolution that has to be fought inside your own domain inside your brain inside your body inside your own life and that's where the revolution exists so all of you guys that keep crying for violence you're missing the fucking point because if you removed all these people with the way that culture is right now and just inserted in with some other people we'd be in the same spot in fucking six months right yeah so this is this is a different thing and it takes a little bit of critical thinking to like put it all together because this is not a fucking checkers game bro this is fucking chess and it's a long game so anyway that's real road is hillary do people still like Hillary Clinton like like real talk like dude my her her most i know her husband doesn't am i right i'm all right listen bro real talk real talk my democrat friends like my democrat family members who supported her fucking a thousand percent those people are disenfranchised with it so like who who's still rooting for this lady yeah you know these people use bots and technology this is no different than a fake fucking influencer on the internet who starts to believe their own shit believe it hi they believe the hype yeah they buy all kinds of shit and then they're like i'm a fucking big deal that's what these people are doing there's nobody in the street still supporting these people passing seats man exactly where is it exactly you got one dude pulling 80 000 people every fucking stop that he stops at you got these people that can't feel a fucking gymnasium and somehow they're winning elections the fuck does that tell you guys yeah well guys that was our third and final headline it is time for our final segment of the show as always we have thumbs up or dumb as fuck that's where we bring a headline up it'll get one of those two options and so with that being set our thumbs up or dumb as fuck headline reads Illinois man charged after shooting himself during dream about burglary initial thoughts guys initial thoughts interesting do we want to see more what we got here right it is Illinois not Florida right why they shoot himself like was a dream about him like getting overwhelmed and so he was he was fear and impending doom he's like i'm out boom dude yeah it depends where he shot him i'm not saying shit because i feel like no matter what i say it's bad karma because like bro i got friends they're like shot their fingers off like accidental shit yeah like i'm not trying to be one of those i want all my fingers i want all my fucking toes like i didn't talk of shit all the other appendages yeah i'm not yeah i want that too yeah and what did it get charged with okay well let's dive into it so uh this is a New York Post article reading it was truly a nightmare scenario this man thought about doing 75 hard shows New York Post there right right right so the article reads it says an Illinois man allegedly shot himself in the leg while dreaming that a burglar was breaking into his home and now he faces criminal charges for the bizarre incident official said mark em dakara who's 62 years old was found by deputies at his lake barrington home just before 10 p.m on April 10th with a gunshot wound to the leg the lake county sheriff's office said in the release investigators were told that dakara was having a dream that someone was breaking into his home located about an hour northwest of chicago while in a stupor from the nightmare terra dakara quote retrieved his 357 magnum revolver and shot at who he believed was the intruder uh quote when he fired he shot himself and apparently woke up from the dream the sheriff's office said dakara was bleeding so heavily from his wound that first responders had to use a tourniquet to stop the blood flow the sheriff office said uh fortunately the round discharge from the firearm went through his leg and went into the bed injuring no one aside from dakara he was taken to an area hospital for treatment of his gunshot wound according to officials no burglary had taken place at dakara's residence at the time of the shooting uh dakara was charged with possessing a firearm with a revoked firearm owner's identification card which is required in lonoy as well as reckless discharge of a firearm sheriff office said uh gun owners must have a foid card in the state of lonoy in order to legally possess firearms or ammunition it's unclear why the cars foid had been revoked in the first place well probably because he sleep walks and shoots him out of the shit that he's still sleepy man got a munch on new still time that dude legit looks like sleepy from snow whiteness and bolts like he like legit looks like him yeah it's poor guy yeah man yeah fuck man i want to know bro i know some people that really do sleep walk like serious like they like serious shit like bro i have this it's dangerous though right like you can't wake them up or nothing no dude i used to know this kid man we were friends with in high school we went to florida one time he went on family vacation with us and my dad woke up and he heard like this metal like the sound of liquid going on the metal and he went over and he was this dude was taking a piss in the fucking washing machine oh man yeah and like bro he was dead asleep like they had no clue what he was doing the next day when like we were making fun of him he's like bro i don't even remember that shit at all oh yeah like dude i know another dude who fucking sleep walks when he's drunk and he pisses on his fucking own suitcase when he's like sau? no i say no names but an a-sau yes i mean what what do we got what do we got on this i don't know man i don't know anything mike how would you set it yourself bro that's fucking tackleberry shit police academy bro it sucks his leg got in the way i mean legitimately i think the worst travesty here is he got charged for some shit for having a non registered firearm in the state of lnoy that's the most fucked up because the fact that registration at that level is getting law-abiding citizens who accidentally shoot themselves in their sleeve whatever the issue is getting them charges that's the exact reason why these registrations exist it's like it exists because confiscation but any of these things come like you get a ticket what you want to compound a ticket have an illegal firearm and will stack the charges that's what it's meant for yep i mean law enforcement officers deploy that kind of how many how many of these people that are committing these crimes in chicago killing fucking 30 and 40 people ever weekend are getting the same charge on them or have four cards i'm just saying right yeah it's like let me check in their foot yeah exactly good like are they looking at their forward cards to see if they're registered and are they catching that additional charge mmm likely not and i mean the studes dumb but i know dudes like andy like who actually have this problem and i had a period of time in my life when the v.a. was prescribing me ambian and trasadone at the same time oh that's a cocktail babe dude and then you stack a little whiskey on that i dude i would have uh i would wake up and be like where the fuck am i bro yeah crazy shit i know a dude who total his fucking car like that he fucking woke up he had ambian and i guess like he didn't react well to it and woke up like told like when i say told or wasn't like he hit something they told i mean like you look at the car and you're like holy fuck bro how is anybody alive he fucking lived and it was off of ambian because like he was fucking sleepwalking yeah i have the same z's yeah close to that yeah that's fucked up man so i mean what what are we giving this though i think it's dumb as fuck bro same yeah i think the dude's dumb like if you're you should probably secure your weapons a little bit better i'm i'm not the i'm not the prepared no he's dumb yeah he's dumb it will one he should a 357 revolver yeah right i level up and some automatic pistol man bro that's like that's seriously like some dirty damn shit yeah fucking uh police academy dirty hairy shit that's right right still intimidating fucking gun it is having on display but then use your block you know exactly something bro i got one of those smith and wesson 500 revolvers yeah that thing what a waste of fucking money that was holy shit bro i shot it for one fucking time at night and like got the flames and i'm like oh this is fucking this sucks it hurts my hand yeah can't fucking shoot it they make that shit a two inch barrel too yeah is the one that spits flames up it's got the big flame throw at the end of it yeah i got the long one you know i got to compensate right i'm saying it's also black that's why no oh hey that's what bro we
