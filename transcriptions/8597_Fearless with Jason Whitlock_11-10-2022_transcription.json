Alright now that we've got that out of the way we can get down to business and talk about why you're here for the show today. We have a fantastic topic a fantastic fire starter and then we'll get TJ Delano and Steve Kim to fan these flames I'm about to start so let's get it rolling. Quit blaming the referees for ruining the NFL. Take Jerome Boker and Carl Jeffers out of your crosshairs. The lead officials flagging defensive lineman for roughing the passer are soldiers following orders handed down from on high. The players current and former are responsible for undermining the integrity of NFL competition and feminizing the game. The players chose De Maurice Smith a beta male with a subversive agenda to lead their union. The players swallowed the anti-gene upshaw narrative and decided the NFL PA needed an executive director with no connection to or passion for football. They prioritized leadership that would be adversarial with ownership aligned with progressive politics and willing to rage a race war with an industry that produces more blackmail millionaires than any other. Useful idiots elected a Trojan horse to lead them. Players safety defined Smith's 13 year leadership platform. Like all marks his ideas Smith's platform uses the skin of truth to hide the meat of a lie. Sorry for stealing that voting but I had to. He paves the road to hell with alleged good intentions. He wants to make football safer. It's a virtuous goal but it has its limits. It's the equivalent of making carrot cake less fattening. You remove the frosting brown sugar, flour, cream cheese and butter and before you know it you're closer to making cold slaw than cake. The enemies of masculinity hate football and its perch atop American popular culture. They're waging a long war to turn football into soccer. A sport played at a high level by men and women. Smith serves that agenda. A DC lawyer Smith is the antithesis of his predecessor Upshaw, a Hall of Fame NFL player who innately understood the essence of football. The game sells gladiator-style violence to an audience that loves high-risk competition. Upshaw fought for players to earn as much money as possible in exchange for taking the physical risk. He was not unconcerned with the health of players. He simply understood the league's TV partners sell cake, not cold slaw. So who led the over-reaction to Tuatung Viola's concussion? Demary Smith and the NFLPA. Smith called for a full investigation of how the Miami Dolphins handled Tuah's injury in the game against the Buffalo Bills. Tuah left that game with either a back injury or head trauma and returned to finish it. Throughout the history of professional and amateur football, players have returned to games after suffering an injury millions of times. It's not remotely uncommon. Over the last decade, as corporate media have used CTE junk science to undermine football participation, every time a football player gets his bell rung, it's treated as a possible life and death situation. The same thing we celebrate in boxing or mixed martial arts we villainize on the football field. We pretend that 70% of men who participated in tackle football past high school or at risk of developing dementia by age 60. Its media-induced madness stummered to the fear mainstream media for a minute around the COVID flu. The real pandemic is fear. We're being programmed to fear football. Demary Smith is football's Dr. Anthony Fauci. ESPN is CNN. The NFL's concussion protocol is the N95 math. Who campaigned for the NFL to immediately adjust this called Cushion Protocol after Tuah suffered head trauma or a spinal injury on Thursday night against the Bengals? Demary Smith and the NFLPA. So who is ultimately responsible for referee's drum boker and Carl Jeffers flagging Grady Jared and Chris Jones for roughing the passer on routine harmless football plays? Smith and the NFLPA. They caused the hysteria that is rapidly changing the game of football. Troy Aikman complained on Monday night football that he was tired of the way the NFL was being officiated. He demanded that the least competition committee take the dresses off the players. Take a listen for yourself. Here's a call again or the play again. The ball comes out right there and the ball is possessed by Jones. He's going to the ground with car. His body's there. It's just where it is too much. I mean my hope is the competition committee looks at this in the next set of meetings and you know we take the dresses off. All right after watching that same sack strip of Derek Carr, Tony Dunge tweeted, this is not football anymore. I know we have to protect the quarterback but Chris Jones was recovering a fumble. We have gotten ridiculous with this. Aikman as a player and Dunge as a coach are both enshrined in the pro football hall of fame. Aikman suffered multiple concussions during his playing career. Dunge led defenses that feature concussion giving hitters like John Lynch, Derek Brooks and Warren Sapp. Football is not meant to be a safe space. Removing the hard hits and wrapping the quarterbacks in bubble wrap undermines the integrity of the game. So do all the limits on practice time and practice contact. The game that Troy Aikman played isn't the same one that 45 year old Tom Brady now dominates. The current game devalues Brady's accomplishments. We're turning Babe Ruth into mighty Mike Mancinko. You ever heard of Mancinko? He's the home run king of softball. He cracked more than 6,000 homers. He's not Babe Ruth. The NFL is fast-pitched softball with a bunch of guys getting very bonds money. This construct fuels a justifiable and unhealthy resentment among retired players. The old guys who actually built the league into a TV powerhouse sit at home nursing their wounds and watching Kyler Murray earn 46 million a season for playing a game they don't respect or recognize. You don't have to be Dick Fuches' age to harbor that resentment. If you played in the NFL 15 or 10 years ago you have a right to be frustrated. The frustration manifests itself in peculiar ways. The former players aren't matted to Marie D. Marie Smith or the union. They blame the people who the media instruct them to blame. Ownership. It's Jerry Jones's fault. It's Dan Snyder's fault. It's the billionaire owners. It's the white man's fault. He's their daddy. That's not true. This is on the players. They're poor stewards of a game that enriches them. The players follow Colin Kaepernick into the anti-American abyss. The players follow the alphabet mafia into the Black Lives Matter abyss. The players denigrate football. The industry that has produced more Black millionaires than hip-hop or even the NBA. The players won't defend the game that has been very good to them. They're so controlled by bitterness and envy and social media they'd rather tear down the NFL than leave the league intact for the next generation. Many of the former players want the NFL to fail. They made their money. They want the ratings to drop and for fans to walk away. They naively and foolishly believe it will hurt the billionaire owners who have a plethora of revenue streams. They don't care that it will deprive the next generation of players from acquiring the life-changing and generational wealth that benefited the former players. The intentional mishandling of the player safety issue is just another version of the long-form okey-doke Black liberals find irresistible. Deemoree Smith is football's Lyndon Johnson. Player safety is the great society initiative. The concussion protocol is welfare. And all the beta males chirping on ESPN are welfare queens. That's my fire. I'm going to invite Delano and TJ and Steve Kim into the conversation. Before I do that I want to take care of just a tiny bit more business so that we can just fall off into this conversation and forget about all the business. So guys hate going to the doctor.

Go there be a good little fearless soldier. Your wife will be real happy with you. I got one day I'll be right there with you. All right so let's bring Steve Kim into the conversation. I always I like to start with our visitors over Skype. Steve I think we've got this all backwards. We're blaming the refs for a problem that the NFLPA and the current players are actually driving. Do you agree? Uh partially do I believe the referees are virtue signaling based on the last dozen or so years and specifically the two-way situation. I don't think there's any doubt about it but look the referees in this case they got to have better football savvy at the end of the day they're the ones making the calls and particularly that Chris Jones play which I thought was interesting I've never seen a sack strip be called a quarterback or roughing the passer and so now we delved into the situation where you want to protect the quarterbacks who are the hope diamond of the national football league they do really run that association that you've made them untouchable to a point it's a penalty where if you hit the quarterback too hard Jason I don't know if you noticed this but the first two sacks of the game the defenders made it a point not to bring the quarterbacks to the ground and I'm thinking oh boy it's already started but as the guys got lathered up as they started to play the game of football they started tackling and just the hypocrisy um is striking to me this is where I do blame the referees if you're going to make that the new standard that you a quarterback cannot hit the ground like they're wearing a red jersey in practice make it across the board because in the second quarter Denzel Perriman flung the homes to the ground and everyone held their breath and was like oh there's no penalty and I think that's where the referees do bear some of the blame think about this if the Chris Jones play goes on flag nobody would have said a thing I still think to me they're the last barrier to making football football and to me that's not even a borderline place I disagree I think the referees do bear some responsibility you use the word some so me and so give me a percentage then if you had a choice between blaming the NFL the referees or the actual players in their association those three groups break me down on a percentage basis who you blame I'm go 60% the administration which is the upper upper offices that the more smiths of the world Roger Goodell and I'd go 20% to the referees and I'd go 20% to the players although and I sent you guys a bunch of tweets I'm glad that the workforce because they're important I'm glad that the current players are now speaking out say oh wait a minute wait a minute we didn't sign up for this we know what we got into let us play the dog on game the way it's supposed because without them actually speaking out nothing will change I hope last night is some sort of marking point where at least we get back to some sanity into this whole process Steve is only putting 60% of blame on the administration or the guys in suits and the players association I I I'm gonna go 95% TJ 100 these are time employees we had it they tried a program they started this in 2019 oh you're blaming the refs 100% no no 0 100% on the administration oh okay these referees are a bunch of part-time employees that don't even get benefits that's the people we're gonna blame for rooting the NFL that's like these these guys barely get a 401k match I'm reading about it as they're sitting here so it's like they may throw a flag knowing that everybody up top is saying okay good you did what we told you to do but the referees I mean some of these guys got social media and whatever and especially like the Dean Blandino's and Mike Prever they get crushed over social media when they make these type of calls nobody wants to be talking about this the good officials and if you're in the NFL typically you're a pretty good official don't want anybody to know your name you want to stay out of the way as much as possible and you became a referee because you loved the game and so 0% this is 100% I don't even blame the NFL PA like you I blame 100% the idiots running the NFL who have caved the woke idiots and said sure we'll wreck the sport for another reason don't blame the NFL PA even though we got to have an investigation tool got hurt and returned to the game we've never seen that in the NFL that's unbelievable we must investigate we're in the FBI let's raid Mar-a-Lago you don't blame the NFL PA and it's all on gudel there the NFL PA has always been full of idiots right they most and the NFL players in general these are a bunch of guys who don't know business they don't know anything except for what's right in front of them everybody you know everybody has their brand now and they think business is I'm popular give me money that's the extent of what they know about business so the NFL but do you remember he's Smith don't know anything about business he's in the business of manipulation and so the guys who know business the 32 billionaires who are up there should say kick rocks we've built the greatest business that's ever existed again to build more black millionaires than I've ever existed and so some people are going to get hurt in this violent sport we'll handle it as best we can. Delano I know you're not the expert here but you can be the arbitrator so one thing that hasn't come up in the conversation I think is worth raising is the potential that this was just a bad call all of us who watch sports series of bad calls now series but but the fact that it wasn't called the other way on on the Mahomesack would would make me question okay did the refs just get it get it wrong and I think people are starting to say you know roughing calls should be reviewable on the instant replay if we see a pattern of this moving forward then I think it's fair to say okay I definitely think that part of it has to be the NFLPA they they say we're looking out for the players we're looking out for player safety these guys are not just not just cards in a machine these are real people with real lives and real families so we want to do everything to protect them I think that's the NFLPA's position but there's another part of it which is you know the league itself and and upper upper echelon gadel and and you know sort of central administration I think it's worth sort of disentangling some of these issues because I know we you Jason in the column grouped a lot of them together right I'm I'm just curious to know what would be I guess the impetus for the NFL to want to ruin its own game I see why they would want to make the NFL gay because they say oh wow look there's 15 gay guys who like football so we can appeal to them but part of me just I keep going back to the same thing why would these guys want to kill the golden goose and my and maybe I didn't go in depth here but it's a part of my overall narrative for 10 years that the game's under attack by the left true and if you go back why Joe Lockhart Joe Lockhart was a Clinton political operative who got a who got installed as basically the head of media relations in the NFL and it was his job he was the Trojan horse within the NFL offices and it was his he he led how the NFL handled Colin Kaepernick in 2016 and it was all an inside job a plant the the NFL mishandled Colin Kaepernick and on the player's side of the player's union D Marie Smith is not a football person D. Maris Smith is a five foot six tiny human being that was a DC lawyer right tied up in the DC Democratic political operative game and all of that he the players foolishly got baited into smearing the smearing of Gene Upshaw for years that went on Brian Gump everybody's a sellout he's just there that and it was all to create this belief that hey you shouldn't be represented by a former player you need to be represented by someone who understands politics and can operate at this level and so they got a political operator running who does not care one bit about football players not one bit football players were pulling his underwear up and giving him a wedgie lock a road he was growing up and he don't care about football players yeah they got someone now so he's a puppet and that's why they're playing 17 games right now and that's why again and he and his whole brand is player safety that's so his legacy is put it ain't like I'm gonna get you guys the most money I can for playing this high risk sport and I'm gonna make sure you're taking care of post your career it's player safety his whole b-d-merry and player safety is an issue that the left knows football can't win yeah it's almost like say can this seat that I'm sitting on can it win a fight with my rear end no it cannot it's an impossibility where I'm at right now as a safety in football you can't win let's prioritize safety unboxing let's prioritize accidents in marriage you ain't on wind with too many men or women you know it's like that's the priority I'm gonna make abstinence the priority in marriage right it's all a long play to compromise football and it's working the whole everybody's focused on safety they're not focused on enjoyment competition everybody's watching oh my god I hope no one gets hurt breathing that's like bringing that mentality to a fight but but you did say in your column that gene up Shaw did care about player safety yeah and and you think there are ways to make the game safer without turning it from cake to coast law so my question would be if Jason Whitlock we pass all those steps they've done all they can okay is you they may take it as far as they can with the game in terms of safety actually because again people want to see the quarterback knocked on his rear end true when I go to a boxing match I want to see somebody hit the ground yep Deontay Wilder Tyson Fury somebody's got to go down for me to I want to do with Joe Rogan day when somebody gets knocked out that that's part of the joy of football and it's built into the game go ahead Steve thank you for boxing long time ago someone told me that was in the sport for years made they're living in the industry of boxing it's Steve you want to make boxing safe and I said well of course yeah how when he goes ban it it's the only way so we have to live with this sport the way it is and the actual participants and I've known thousands of boxers they want a box they know the rest they know what they're getting into and with that said with Demora Smith here's a question I have if you want to go about player safety and their well-being outside of football if you agree to that 17th game after 10 years of saying that football is too rough of a game if you agree to that extra week of pounding what type of medical benefits did you negotiate on behalf of your union forget the CTE issue I know of a lot of players because they say it on social media and I've actually met a few that have numerous surgeries that have nothing to do with neurological issues for years knees back all that type of stuff just from the usual pounding and they say you know after about four or five years my benefits run out so that's a lot of lift service that Demora Smith can say I care about the overall safety and well-being of my constituents but if you are not negotiating lifetime medical benefits and things of that nature it comes off as very very hollow but here's the issue going to what yeah go ahead TJ yeah well I can speak to that actually because I was I still get all the emails involved in the what the NFL PA is trying to get from people and so they actually pushed pretty hard they got dental for I still just having a year on a roster I get dental insurance and so they've tried some things last year and or last time they went had their go around in the negotiations that was the number one sticking point we went lifetime health care they couldn't even get a health insurance company to give them a bid they said it's too much don't even try so they actually went down this road not to not to defend the NFL PA who I hate but I'm just telling they that was their sticking point and they couldn't even get a bid from a company they said we're not doing it and so I think a lot of the things that they want that they're being denied is because I don't think Demary Smith is authentically negotiating on their behalf and it's like this whole adversarial relationship gimmick that everyone and the NFL owners are racist and I'm the black guy taking on these racist NFL owners Gene Upshaw already blew that up it's a partnership and that that's part of my argument where I disagree with Steve is because the players and ownerships although there's not equality there is a partnership they're junior partners in this game of football and so the junior partners are being led down a path of safety safety safety and let's take a dump on the NFL and call everybody racist this smearing and killing they're not being good partners and if they went and negotiated in partnership and I'm not talking about just playing nice and rolling over but these are partners we're all getting rich your billionaires we want to be as close to billionaires we can be let's figure out how to do this and where we can make as much money put a high quality product on the field and make as much money in the shorter period of time as we can for these players I think you can start if you're that's your mindset you can start winning some of these things in the negotiation but because and again part of this has to do with they spent 10 15 years brutalizing Gene Upshaw's reputation calling every name in the book for things that because it used to be well Gene he can Gene won't get him guaranteed contracts he's he's a house near grow he's under their thumb 13 years Deemoree Smith has been the head of the executive director show me anywhere where people are complaining about his inability to get guaranteed contracts the whole topic went away because Gene up they didn't need it to beat up Gene Upshaw and it was irrelevant when they were talking about Gene Upshaw because the signing bonuses and all that stuff had started under Gene Upshaw and we love to complain oh no yes there are guarantees in the contract when they hand you 25 30 million upfront that's a guarantee now is all of your contract no because in this game there's so much inherent risk we can't do that we'd have too many guys lay down and be like well and you know I'm injured I can't play give me the rest of my money it's not a possibility in football but a high percentage of the money now is guaranteed yeah particularly for the for the biggest stars that actually draw ratings the other thing that I find fascinating about this and and and I really want to all of you but Steve and in particular because we're journalists love to talk about legacy and you know how we see a player the whole integrity of the game is at stake in my view and Tom Brady's because I'm going to start making this argument publicly hey man you can't put Tom Brady on the same pedestal as these guys who played real football and I think Tom Brady knows it that's why he trashes the game publicly and says it's bad football and Troy Aikman just let it slip last night that he knows that he's looking at guys put up numbers and stats and everybody's better than Troy Aikman and he's like man are you kidding me if these guys played in my era their numbers would look just like mine that's why the integrity of the game you can't put these guys in the same category as Ray Lewis and the other guys that played in a far more physical and taxing NFL than the people that and particularly these wide receivers and the numbers they're putting up when they can walk across the middle with no fear are you kidding me the degree of difficulty has been reduced in this game to the point that I can put an asterisk next to all of these guys playing right now Steve your reaction to that I don't know about you but when Troy Aikman had that dressline that he stole from Jack Lambert I gave him a flow 80s clap I mean wow I think we must protect Troy Aikman at all costs like we're Nate Newton and Eric Williams here's the issue um and it was so funny the reaction on Twitter a couple of guys saying I can't believe the misogyny my wife and my daughter are the toughest people I know they might be but they can't play football let them try see what happens it still takes a special breed of human being even now to play that game at a high levels Division 1 or National Football League but with that said this is what Troy Aikman is he's that 75 80 year old guy that worked at the steel mill or the graveyard ship that the factory that probably got paid a decent wage at best a good night out for him was probably pounding a couple of nanny lights at the bar every Friday night in a steel mill town right or the Rust Belt and every five years he could probably save up for chief seats at three river stadiums watch the old Steelers and he looks at today's generation that gets to work from home that needs mental health breaks right and they get a month full of vacations and benefits he could only dream of and he's thinking good lord really we're not the same and there's no doubt about it I remember Troy Aikman I literally saw every snappy ticket UCLA in 1987 and 88 okay and I have a great proclivity for him I think he's one of the best pure natural passes I ever saw but you know what he was guys he was the toughest son of a gun I ever saw in the pocket him and Phil Sims there's this particular play in 1989 his rookie year he's he was playing the Cardinals when they were still at that Arizona State Stadium Freddy Joe Nunn hit him like a rocket ship 280 pounds I mean right into the head in the chest and he threw a deep crossing route for what I thought was going to be the game-winning touchdown with a minute and a half to go Troy Aikman was laid out for five minutes I mean it was one of the most vicious things I ever saw and he stared right down the barrel of a gun nowadays that would be assault and battery and maybe attempted murder and then if you go back the 1993 NFC Championship game he ducks down he runs into the knee of Dennis Brown he was knocked out Bernie Cozer had to finish that game plays in the Super Bowl I think a week or two later and Troy Aikman says to this day I don't even remember really the NFC Championship game I don't even remember the Super Bowl and then his career was ended by the final concussion with the bar Aarrington so I think he looks at this game as being very soft he respects these players but I don't think he respects what it's become this particular game of football so I understand where Troy Aikman is coming from I think it's a it's a further softening of men and you and you can't we're doing this to our military we're now doing it with football and it's like you can't reach whatever your maximum capacity would be if everybody's coddling you all the time I was a borderline athlete six-foot tall 200 pounds these 183 when I went to college probably didn't have a lot of business being on a division one field but I was willing to go across the middle and get my head knocked off over and over and over again to where it was like if we need seven yards just throw it to that kid and he may be laying there on the ground concuss for a while but we'll get those seven yards and it was and it gave me an opportunity to bring something different today and Tom Brady talks a lot about this we played a video about last year some time where he's like you don't have to read a defense you don't even have to lead people out of trouble just throw the ball somewhere in between them and you can guarantee a targeting penalty and you'll get your 15 yards doing it that way and so my my issue and this is why I agree with what you're saying Tom Brady's actively fighting against this because he actually came into the league when Drew Bloodsow got knocked out of a game when you could hit quarterback so he had to earn his stripes as a guy that played it wasn't the Terry Brad Shaw league right it was a little bit different in the 70s and in 2000 but it was still a tough league in year 2000 and that time has gone and it's not a game high risk high reward in everything that you do if you're if you're running a billion dollar company and you're the CEO you could go bankrupt and lose everything that's it you may make a billion dollars you may lose everything that's the high risk high reward in everything in football the high risk is you may have an ACL issue you may at some point have some back issues and here's 10 million dollars for your trouble do you want in or don't you yeah Delano we were you were talking before the show maybe not understanding the resentment angle and I'm wondering if in this conversation could you understand why perhaps some former players I definitely understand why they are would be resentful I guess the point I was trying to make and I think TJ brought this up and I'll piggyback on it I think the changes that we see in the NFL are ones that we see throughout the culture and society in general right masculinity is under attack everything is getting softer right and this is not just the NFL all the leagues have changed in one way shape or another the NBA of 2022 is not the NBA of 1992 right you it's just it's a totally different league you can't you know and guys in Jordan's generation say you can't hand check a guy you can't do this can't do that I can't touch a guy so I get why all the players would be resentful I completely understand that what's hard for me to understand is is that these guys don't see what it is that they're doing but then I again I think what what you see throughout the society is people who have been past the baton use it to basically strike at the foundation of whatever structure they should be building and I said this I think it was yesterday or at some point you have and I was talking more so in a in a social context right you mean you may have cities let's say a guy grows up in Philadelphia he's fifth generation Philly kid if he's an activist he may be trying to burn down a building that is grandfather built and what you see is every institution has people from the inside that are trying to destroy something that the people who came before them built and and some of those the play safety things I think people are very sympathetic to it and even as a fan to me I'm just like look man I was kind of pathetic to it yeah yeah but I was a Cowboys fan and it's like I saw how Troy would look again we were talking about Luke Keekley right yeah Keekley is a guy who could have been an all-time great he had to retire but I mean I'm not willing to sacrifice the game for a few individuals who aren't built for it agreed agreed we agree there what I'm saying to me as a fan I at least get the player safety stuff what I don't get is we need to make the NFL gay we need to make the NFL a global game Jason one one of your best and most insightful commentaries when you were speak for yourself is you juxtapose the NBA and the NFL and how the NBA wanted to become a global game and the NFL particularly in more recent years and the NFL is a game where you have rivalries between cities and it made people buy into the game in a way that was different than the NBA which is sold across the world particularly now to China you see that in a bunch of different areas and the league it's it's insistence on the social justice stuff and and they paint racism on the back of the helmet and they paint black lives matter those are the types of things that to me as a fan I'm just like the NFL is I mean right now it has a limited shelf life because if what the league wants to do is become a vehicle for social justice even the average fans are eventually gonna turn it off yeah go ahead Tijia I mean go ahead Steve to pick you back up Delano's point he's right all leagues at the professional level let's say the four major sports is gotten softer let's go back there's a famous clip I believe it's the 72 major league baseball all-star game and this is an exhibition game and I'm sure we've all seen the clip P Rose bowls over I think it was Ray Fossey for the game run I mean just bowls them over a game that didn't count you know after the buster posy injury about eight years ago you're not even allowed to have home plate collisions anymore you basically have to kind of slide out of the way the catchers cannot block the plate and so those things were gone one of my most vivid and those bitter memories as a young Laker fan 1984 finals Lakers on the verge of salting the series away Kurt Rambis goes in for a layup and all of a sudden Kevin McKay like never forget he clotheslines Rambis right both benches empty did you know guys that you know what they called after all that all right everyone get to the free throw line two free throws for you Rambis everyone gets back that's all it was I mean I'm amazed because when they talk about flagrant run flagrant to assault and battery attempted murder that play was just okay guys get off the floor all right free throws and the Lakers never recovered from that physical force also baseball I remember growing up base to talk about guys like Don Baylor would go out of the way it feels the runner-on first and those a double play if that second basement was anywhere near the infield Baylor was going to try to take you out it didn't matter how close he was they didn't give a damn nowadays you slide too hard it's an issue so all in hockey it all started in the mid-80s I believe there was a time that nobody wore helmets and they start to enforce the helmet rules but there used to be a lot of fights I mean bench clearing brawls it was great all these Canadians throwing punches missing each other grab you don't even see that anymore it's not old-time hockey as I say in slap shot so it's not just the end you can't even keep your go ahead Steve that no you can't keep your face open anymore you got to wear a visor now they just keep adding to it right everybody acts like the slippery slope doesn't exist name of everything Steve just said name me a sport that's better today than it was in the 1980s now we got more skill but I would way rather see the bad boy Pistons and Jordan try to overcome that the one I think I love Steph Curry I don't need to see him shoot any more shots from half court right I want him to see I want to see him go on the lane and get beat up and overcome the fun is seeing guys overcome and men have we're inherently physical right you need to be the guy who can out toughen in the guys who can't out tough it don't belong but in these sports today you do belong but you don't need your toughness and I think the overall well I would say really quick sleep the overall thing is that we no longer live in a in a society that honors gladiators right and you see this even we we've talked about like the different ads in the US military right the ones in China Russia I don't I don't speak either those languages but I know what it is that they're promoting and then you get to the ones in the United States and it's a cartoon and it's about a girl who has two moms and she always felt that she wanted to do more with her life and part of this is just again our culture does not honor gladiators it doesn't honor toughness it doesn't honor masculine it it thinks the best way for men to be men is to become more like women and I think you see that play out both in the physical realm in terms of professional sports and even even in on college campuses it's you know we can expose you to ideas that may may trouble you we have to have safe spaces we have to have comfort squirrels and coloring books for the 2016 election and all these things I think run together and and are being pushed by and I love the words you use in the column people with subversive agendas because if masculinity is is the norm then we have to subvert that with with femininity and I think you see that injected into all of our sports Steve yeah Delano it's interesting I thought about you because when you're talking this thing did become political football let's go back to 2020 as all of this was going on in our world the upheaval and there was a stretch I believe of about two weeks where people did not realize or know was there going to be a football season and if you remember people like Max Kellen were saying well the SEC only wants to play football to appease Trump voters and I'm thinking okay you want to make that that was this that was a reach if there ever was one right so I thought it was really interesting that different parts of the country did though from the SEC they flat out said I don't know about y'all we're playing football we're SEC but there were different parts of the country specifically the West Coast which was more liberal and I remember the Pac-12 was not going to play and maybe the big 10 was until they realized oh wait a minute if the SEC plays football that's a bad look for all of us and I love the fact that two players Trevor Lawrence and Justin Fields at um we're going to go against the media narrative we're actually football players we all like football and it was all forced down our throat and I thought it was really interesting so that season went on I saw the exact same journalist when they would see big crowds at Virginia Tech as that was one of the opening games last year 70,000 people at Lane Stadium one of the great atmosphere coming out to the Sandman Americans enjoying an American experience there were certain writers saying oh look at the super spreader event and then you look at their timeline during the riots looting they didn't call that anything they called it peaceful protest thing I think wait a minute wait a minute yeah this thing became such a and I believe that that was an attack on football that okay if we're stuck with football let's keep shipping away at the very foundation of it so when people say all we're drawing a comparison that isn't true if you actually look at the coverage of football going back to 2020 I don't think it's all that far-fetched I'm upset and critical of football players not defending this game and that's the line I'm going to direct this at you and then Steve and TJ chime in but NFL 70 75 percent black players uh this league again creates more black millionaires than any other industry including the NBA because there's just more players certainly more than hip-hop and and that's what cracks me up the hip-hop angle of this if anybody says anything negative about hip-hop people's heads explode and they start criticizing and going after your sellout how dare you question hip-hop hip-hop artists will and I'm like hip-hop where the leading cause of death for rappers is murder yep they're getting slaughtered this industry that they're younger getting slaughtered they go to jail they get ripped off by the music industry and everybody knows it everybody they get ripped off they sign the worst contracts of virtually any entertaining everybody knows but you can't say anything about hip-hop without the artist defending it to his death and blah blah blah but football the former players the current players nobody has a problem bad-mouthing this game and it blows my mind and it it I didn't go here in my column because it was just too much it was just too but but the whole time I was thinking about this yesterday I just hear I was like so we're the people that were over in Africa that were capturing each other and selling them off to Europeans is there something in our wiring that we can't support the things that are actually good for us or that because I'm watching black players sit on people that know better or should know better former players the Dominique Foxworth we've called him out but but I'm like this dude's got to be smart enough to know taking this big dump on football and and and all the people that come on to call in the game racist and and and I'm just they got to know better than this I know it's good for them instant gratification wise over social media but the long haul of this this justification of the destruction and tearing down a football is going to harm us in the long run and I say that as someone had never got a cup of coffee in the NFL but football put me on a college campus and changed my life I feel like I owe this sport and I owe it a defense the same way that a rapper defends hip-hop and I'm just sorry football's been better dusted hip-hop why is this going over our head or where that is that is a fascinating point and I'm going to try to unpack briefly that point sort of in real time because I hadn't thought about it actually as you started to talk I still I thought what you're gonna go is there's a there's a certain self-destructive element that can be found within parts of our community that is expressed by people who in one breath will say Black Lives Matter as they march past an abortion clinic and say good job guys right so there's that juxtaposition with people whose whose logic can't be worked out and I think one of the reasons they defend hip-hop and attack football is because for the for the people who do this the people for whom race is everything they're racist obsessed right they see hip-hop is an attack on the white power structure after police it's nobody whited in police to them right it's after police down with down with the man down with the man right most of it's an attack on us and there's an occasional true attack but but but but in terms of look at some of the groups that they valorized particularly from the late 80s and the early 90s it was NWA and they have that that whole album was no one song on the album but what came what people draw from it even in their documentary is they were attacking the power structure right whereas listen to the album they're attacking Black people and then they got a one F to police song correct yeah and and this is the way it always works yeah it's itself destruction on the inside wrapped in we're attacking the man on the outside but the NFL they see as a bastion of the white power structure which is why somebody like Brian Flores when he's doing his lawsuit he's he's not saying he's not just alleging that the team tried to pressure him to do things against his ethics and values he is saying he's saying the NFL is running like a slave plantation he's drawn on a history there for a particular reason and clearly he wants to topple what he sees as that's that white power structure now he's doing it with two white lawyers and again he's he's free to love who he wants right but I think that's the difference between those two things but I but I do agree there there is an element and and this is why you get people who are not particularly bright because they're I think there's an inverse relationship between you know a person's intelligence and their ability to sort of read a script so if you get really dumb guys they tend to be very good script readers and when when the people who are behind this stuff feed these guys these scripts they'll say no I mean the NFL is they just treat us like black bodies and this is a slavery and a plantation and they don't understand that to your point they are engaging in some seriously self-destructive behavior because for a lot of these guys if it wasn't for college and it wasn't for the NFL they forget about being a millionaire some of them wouldn't even be thousandaires right and and give us some of their backgrounds and you play the numbers and you see some of the things that some of them got into even in college in his prose there's a good chance that a significant number would have been incarcerated by now and and have not had the ability to create generational wealth that completely changed the trajectory of their of their of their family so I do think there's something to that and I think that juxtaposition of the PhD level defenses that hip-hop gets and the PhD level attacks that the NFL gets I think I think there's something to that and I think you see a group a subversive group like Black Lives Matter at the nexus of of those two industries Steve or TJ if you want to hop in if you want to pass go ahead Steve I know you ain't scared I do not believe Dominic Fox woke represents the majority of the thoughts of most players current or former let's go back to what I said in 2020 there'd be no college football if the players themselves did not stand up and say wait a minute we want to play football our conditions aren't perfect we'd like extra benefits let's work on it but we came here to play football guess what we actually like the game because if you remember Jason there's actually like this west coast pack 12 players union that was threatening to blow up the structure and you can see what the mainstream media was going to do they're going to create this storyline and narrative that football players across the country are indentured servants and they're being exploited and none of them actually want to play until you delve deeper most of them wanted to play and unless there's that guy like a Trevor Lawrence and Justin Fields I don't think we would have had a football that season that's a group of young men that stood up for the game of football now let's take a look at the reaction of last night the fact that you had men like Tony Dungy who made his living and a very nice living in football and a legend like Lawrence Taylor and a swath of other former players lamenting what is going on and complaining about it publicly I think is a defense of football and I told you this before last point every Monday out here at the local station a in 570 Rodney Pete and Eric Dickerson host a two-hour show wrapping up football for that weekend they don't like what's going on and they constantly say stuff like you know what we got to bring tackling back we got to bring training camps back and guess what we need to start playing our guys and exhibition games because it's actually safer for them to prepare for the regular season they don't want to dismantle football they actually want the football that they made their living in so I don't really think that there's a whole group of players that want to see this league go under I actually disagree with that because if you read the underlying tone of the reaction of what took place after that Chris Jones hit many of these players actually want to preserve the sport that they grew up in yeah I was gonna say real quick I wouldn't make the argument that a majority of players want the league to go away because again that strikes directly to their self-interest what I'm saying is a major many players engage in behavior that they don't see is undermining the the long-term sustainability the league see brought up 2020 even going back to 2016 like that the Colin Kaepernick era really exposed the vulnerability that the players have to outside pressure there was a period of time where every week it was okay who's gonna kneel who's gonna stand who's gonna get called a sellout right the I remember the one that's burnt seared into my memory is LaShawn McCoy Shady McCoy who was on the sidelines doing calisthenics looking like a complete clown and why because these players who hear the whispers oh it's these guys this is just like slavery right these are 40 million dollar slaves so when when just like any man who feels like someone is trying to to take a hit at his masculinity his natural reaction is to puff his chest up and say no I'm a real man so when these guys here oh these these players are basically slaves they do what the owners tell them to do and here comes Shady he's doing calisthenics he's kneeling these these guys could not see that what they were doing was killing their own league because eventually if you keep just like Jason when you had that parody video and the players were telling the the you know bubble with the with the brewski that he's racist and this on the next eventually the fans that pay for these players salaries are gonna tune out because people don't want to be lectured to a white coal miner in West Virginia who who just wants to enjoy beer and watch the game doesn't want to be told that he's privileged by black guys who made 65 million dollars in a year and so I'm not saying that the players want to destroy the league I'm saying that they don't understand that their behavior particularly as it relates to social justice issues makes the sustainability of the league it puts it in question that's what I'm saying I don't know that they don't know it I think I just didn't know that they're dumbing and I think they are dumbing then you think I think the players know it and they say worth it we can do whatever we want we can we're gonna make this point and and part of it too I'm telling you and this is where there is a parallel here to the hip-hop industry all the owners are white 32 white guys and they will they will do whatever it takes to harm these people even if it's harming themselves right the players will do whatever it takes to harm the owners suicide bombs suicide by exactly but in the in the hip-hop industry a bunch of white power brokers and they're not interested in challenging that and so there is a dynamic even though what they're actually doing is harming themselves in the rap industry at least you got some millionaires going on whatever you there's an extra layer to the white people in the music industry that I talked about on my Twitter feed I'm leaving off this show for now right but uh eventually we'll get there but continue yeah absolutely general general point is I think these are kamikaze pilots I think they're as dumb as they sound I think everybody is explaining to them you're killing a league that is made so many of you come from nothing yeah and go to the penthouse all of you and they're saying doesn't matter don't tell us what we can and can't do see they think they're kamikaze pilots right but kamikaze from their cultural perspective had honor they're really suicide bombers who think they're going to get 72 virgins and and and and when the structure falls and they're gone they wake up and they say what we're we're the virgins and say sorry guys I'm gonna circle this back to what I said at the beginning about Demary Smith and the bad leadership and why they elected a Trojan horse and and the media won't tell them and and social media certainly won't tell them but but his lack of vision and and this connects to y'all's comments about our and Steve's comments about why I hear these former players defending the league or one and and and what I hear from them is they're like oh this gives me an opportunity to talk about why these players are getting things they don't deserve and yet it's unstated but but their whole argument of like look at this game they don't have to practice they don't have to tackle uh the quarterbacks you got to put dresses on them everybody's Franco Harris and running out of bounds and and and it's like they're not doing what we had to do to play this game and to get into the hall of fame and to have these honorable careers so we and so I think they're they have a avenue to express their resentment and dress it up as not being resentment but just observations about where the game is uh and if they had true leadership if they had elected someone who actually cared about football players and this is again the the smearing of gene upshot and the convincing of the players don't put no football player in this position you know he may actually look out for our best interests but a dim dee marie smith had a real vision if a former player or someone that actually loved football player he would be telling the current and the former players guys I'm telling you we're making a lot of money right now we can double this money up and we can get a higher percentage of gross revenue and we can increase the popularity of this game because our competition is so weak the scripted television is horrible and woke and and no one likes it if we just lean into these values that Pete Brozell gave us keep this competition high I'm sure y'all think it's a big deal Patrick Mahomes making 50 million I'm telling you if we follow this plan in five years Patrick Mahomes gonna make a hundred million and we're gonna generate so much revenue and this is where the sale to even the we're gonna generate so much revenue that these former players that laid it on the line whose shoulders we stand on we're gonna generate so much money that we're gonna increase our give back to the eric dickerson's to the older guys we're actually going to generate enough money that we can take care of them no different than how a grown son or daughter reaches back and takes care of his parents here's her parents we're gonna do that for our former players while still making a bunch more money for ourselves and and we're gonna it's gonna be an actual fraternity they love to talk about it's a football fraternity and but they don't take care of each other I look at it I see it go there's always been an issue of true solidarity with then I think almost every union because look you're never gonna get hundreds of laborers to actually agree on everything that's human nature but I go back to the NFL Players Association the strike of 1987 I think that lasted about 55 to 60 days and they ended up bringing in replacement players for a couple of forgettable weeks the product was awful but if you recall the last couple of weeks players started breaking the picket line and they started becoming scam players for lack of a better turn and it let you know right then not everybody is pulling the rope in the same direction and I've heard of other unions but with football the current players when they go to a collective bargaining agreement they think about them they don't think about the forefathers of the game they don't talk about the future everything's about our free agency rights our minimum salary all that other stuff but they never actually say well wait a minute those guys 30 40 50 years ago they played in leather helmets that are doing some really great things but struggling let's give them something and let's also secure our own future that's the problem with many employees in general not just athletes when you go to these situations where you start going for a CBA you're thinking about you I don't know if the NFL has ever had true solidarity across the board no one has true solidarity across the board there's five people in this room right now and trust we all have disparate interests it takes a leader to get four of the five guys to come with the leader the fifth guy or maybe even the fourth and fifth guy may never come along but you want to build enough momentum with two or three in the room that they have no choice but to follow in behind and so I'm not looking for perfect unity I'm looking for leadership and a vision that people can get behind and these guys aren't getting a vision what they're getting from d marie smith is player safety in a game that can't provide player safety if they continue down this path of player safety player safety player safety they're destroying the game they won't have carrot cake they'll have some ingredients that fit with coleslaw coleslaw doesn't sell like carrot cake can't charge as much for it people don't demand it the way that it's a nice little deal I like coleslaw but if I had a choice between coleslaw and carrot cake what if I'm gonna spend 50 dollars or whatever I'm gonna spend it on carrot cake not on coleslaw and so all I'm saying is they don't have a visionary leader or leadership or a leader that actually could come up with a vision because he loves the game and the players that much that he has that vision you know I've been talking about this issue for a solid seven to ten years and I've convinced myself that I'm the ideal person to lead the NFL players association I really believe that and you know not that I want the job but I really believe I'm the ideal person because even though these guys drive me crazy I see myself in them and so I would actually put an agenda for it that actually served them and try to lead them in a direct and again that's what Gene Upshaw did I'm sure there's other guys out there like that but they use social media they use corporate media to convince these guys not to love themselves we can't be led by one of us yeah are you kidding we got to go get this little midget who doesn't like us we were stuffing him into a locker and pulling his underwear over his head all through high school that's who our leader is someone that is nothing like us that's how brainwashed we've been and how how foolish we and then we look up and everybody is on TV dumping on the game that makes you money that you're dependent on is populated and then you you don't think for a moment well what about the 16 year old kid is just like me they wanted to buy his mama a new house let me leave the game in good shape right so that that young man can do for his mama what I did for mine I've been explaining to players for me y'all talk about this crack smack on TV oh no football all the stuff you did for your family yeah and you don't respect this game yeah what what what what job were you oh I was gonna be a doctor and you know I was gonna be a pilot you know for United Airlines no you could play football yeah and again to I graduated college with a 2.2 I graduated high school I think with a 2.8 I got like a 900 something on the SAT football is what put me in the game in a way that I could actually live and finally figure some things out and actually prioritize I got mature enough it so and here's one thing that that they won't discuss sorry Steve the if given the opportunity right because somebody I don't you you seem to believe the football is bulletproof or you said that a couple days ago I don't think they are I think no I think football thinks this bullet proof go ahead fair enough I do think football thinks they're both I don't think they actually are and so if you laid it out because part of the problem is this at the same time that the sport has become safer right and that these guys don't have to go through training camp and don't have to get hit their earnings have skyrocketed during the same time it's it's a false reward because that's not going to last they printed all this money everybody's making more money now but it goes a lot less but go ahead and what I'm yeah what I'm getting at here is that if you did care about the next generation who's going to suffer the consequences because it then you would be making a different deal because if you came to any of these guys right now and said hey here's what we can do we can cut training camp in half we're not going to tackle anymore we'll cut the preseason there's just we're not going to really let people hit you but you got to take a 60% pay cutter you in any one guy signed up not a single one and that's what they're doing to the future generations yeah because they're saying here's the game we're going to leave for you and for a little while it's going to be you know there's a Dennis Prager said this it's a great analogy it's the cut flower analogy where he said hey everything when when the the structure is really good like a flower and and you have the roots and everything it's great the flower looks good and when you cut it you can give it to somebody for a couple days it still looks like a flower it's really good but all the basis of what made it amazing is gone and it's going to die and that's what these people are doing to football they're cutting out the bottom of it and they're handing the next generation of flower that looks nice and they're going to have a nice salad for a little bit and it's going to plummet like crazy as soon as people realize this ain't a good product anymore I'm living in a romanticized past this ain't John Elway that was better than my carrot cake and cold floor analogy I like that too Steve go ahead real quick I'm running out of time your story about what the game no matter how rough or tough affords opportunities that otherwise would not be available it reminds me more of the great lines from a pre-fighter meeting that HBO had was uh Seqwon Barkley's uncle I believe was I ran the blade Barkley very good middleweight best known for beating Thomas Hearns twice so he's fighting on HBO the day before they meet with the fighters to get some info and Jim Lampley asked well I ran what would you be doing without boxing and Barkley just goes probably breaking into your home so god bless boxing I'm glad that was the blade. Well you gotta follow the jaw before we go I mean I think I agree you know what TJ said and I just I Jason when I see you and I hear you say you would be the perfect fit for you know to be the end of LPA it's not just your level football but when I listen to you talk I hear somebody who respects the people who came before him and the institutions that they built because there are very few people who I could think of in the public sphere particularly in sports who are more connected to their armor model than you are so I hear you talk about your family I hear you talk about the church you grew up in I hear you talk about your college and all of these things I hear you say these things were good to me let me reach back and be be good to the people who helped me become who I am but in NFL a lot of guys you know guys who want to to to carry the banner for the league I think of guys one that came to mind while while you guys was talking I think about somebody like Ray Lewis who is a I mean football guy to the core right I mean he's got some of the best sound you know being miked up so on and so forth and when he was alleged to have tried to try to reach out broke ordeal between the Ravens and Colin Kaepernick and see if he can do something they attack Ray Lewis with with memes of Stephen from Django to make it seem as if he's some sellout bootlicking coom who who is not standing on the side of Colin Kaepernick in his quest for racial justice that type of thing is is the type that type of mindset is what leads to destroying institutions because if you can't celebrate a guy like Ray Lewis or guy like Michael Ervin or the guys who really say this game has been good to me I want to be good to the game then you're not going to have a game to to play years down the line guys I spent so much time on this this is all we got to get to today I apologize you can email the show I have an email that now works fearless blaze show at gmail.com fearless blaze show at gmail.com we'll play tomorrow and we'll see you tomorrow uhh I want free, baby, I want, I want free Don't leave me, I want free"
