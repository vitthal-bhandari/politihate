Okay, so Johnny Depp, this is the news that was kind of blowing up this past week on social media, especially for anyone who hasn't been keeping up with the celebrity drama, which is strange because I know about this, but it's not like I'm reading people or Cosmo. This is just, I feel like it's hard to avoid this type of news. Yeah, it's everywhere right now. It's everywhere. A few years ago, actress Amber Heard, she came forward with photos of herself looking bruised and beaten at the time she was married to Johnny Depp, of course, Jack Sparrow. The two were then going through an apparently bitter divorce. This was in 2016. So she released photos of herself being bruised. When that happened, Johnny Depp was canceled. Everyone was furious at him. He was labeled an abuser. I think his ex-wives at the time actually came out to defend him. I think he's been married to other times saying, hey, he was never violent with me. That was a great guy. But, I mean, hey, they didn't need to do that. No, that's good for them. And I think he also lost the ability to perform his iconic role in the Pirates of the Caribbean as a result of that too. Yeah, he was kind of booted from that franchise. So I don't know. He was in the Harry Potter spin-off after that. I mean, so people have really debated whether he was canceled at all, but it'd be, yeah, he did lose out on any more Pirates of the Caribbean movies. And even when he was in that fantastic beast and where to find them, Colin, the crimes of Grindelwald movie, which was trash, by the way, there were still people who were upset about it. So this definitely, it harmed his career, harmed his reputation. Meanwhile, Amber Heard, his ex-wife, the actress, she went on to appear in Justice League and Aquaman. So things are going pretty good for her after this. What a thought that an Aquaman movie would be a good thing. I know, right? It's strange to hear. Now though, new photos, new audio recordings have come out and it's looking like at the very least things weren't as, I mean, open and shut as a lot of people assumed it to be in 2016. And the idea that Amber Heard was the victim, Johnny Depp, the abuser is now being called into question. We have this from the Daily Mail. It's written, Depp has filed a $50 million defamation suit in Virginia after Heard penned an op-ed for the Washington Post detailing her experiences as an alleged domestic violence victim. Did you see that post or that article when it came out? Because I don't think I did. No one came out, no. Yeah. But apparently she had written, I became a public figure representing domestic abuse and I felt the full force of our culture's wrath for women who speak out, she wrote, in the December 2018 article, which didn't mention the Pirates of the Caribbean actor by name. Depp claimed nonetheless that it implicated him as the abuser damaging his reputation and causing him to lose his prize role of Captain Jack Sparrow. His suit says he's the victim of an elaborate hoax, instigated by her to generate positivity, sorry, positive publicity and advance her career. Miss Heard is not a victim of domestic abuse. She is a perpetrator, it claims. She hid, punched and kicked me. She also repeatedly and frequently threw objects into my body and head, including heavy bottles, soda cans, burning candles, television remote controls and paint thinner cans, which severely injured me. Heard responded with a lurid 300 page filing of her own cataloging the horrific abuse she claims to have suffered at Depp's hands, describing him as the monster and recalling many of the allegations she made during the divorce. The filing included photos of bruises and scars, clumps of hair apparently torn from her head and pictures of smashed up furniture to illustrate the violence she was allegedly subjected to after hooking up with Depp, her co-star in the Rum Diary back in 2011. Now, so they're both saying that the other is responsible for abusing themselves and we didn't include pictures because some of them are pretty graphic, but Johnny Depp, some of the photos that were released, it looks as if his finger was essentially sliced off, which he is saying that she did to him. She threw a bottle at the counter and exploded and somehow, you know, by the laws of physics, he lost almost a part of his finger. It looks pretty gruesome. There are also, I don't know exactly the details, but people have been saying that she apparently defecated on his bed. It's like crazy things, you know, and there are photos of Johnny Depp with. It looks like cigarette butt marks on his face. It's just, it's really bad. So they both have photos kind of incriminating the other, but what's really interesting are the audio clips. So with all of this, there have been audio clips released and I think these were actually taken during like therapy sessions or something like that and they don't look good for Amber Heard, right? Because with the photos, we can say maybe one was attacking the other, the other only acted in self defense or whatever. But when it comes to these audio clips, it really seems like we have one violent perpetrator, Amber Heard, and someone else, Johnny Depp, who doesn't want this. We have one of the first audio clips here. I do not want to divorce. I do not want you out of my life. I just want peace. If things get physical, we have to separate. We have to be a part that can be no physical violence. I agree about the physical violence, but separating for a day, all night, taking a night off from our marriage. No, no, no. All I'm saying is we need to take whatever time we need to kind of let things settle for a minute. I can't promise you that I'll be perfect. I can't promise you I won't get physical. God, I f***ing have to get so mad. So Johnny Depp trying to assert there should be no physical abuse, no violence between them. If anything is going to happen, they should just separate her saying, I can't promise I won't get physical. I mean, we like, I'm honest. Well, and well, people are going to say, well, of course, this is taken out of context because this what I've found interesting is that Amber Heard still has a lot of people carrying water for her. I mean, like, hashtag justice for Johnny was trending. A lot of people are kind of coming out for Johnny Depp now. And if they had previously said things about him, they're apologizing. But there are people with even the horrific photos of Johnny Depp coming out, these audio things saying, oh, she was acting in self defense as a woman who was abused. And it's like, I mean, obviously no one knows what happened exactly between those two except for those two, but it's I feel like how much of the benefit of the doubt can this person be given when she's on tape saying, I can't promise I won't get physical. Like what kind of context would turn that conversation into one where Johnny Depp was actually the aggressor? Like I'm having trouble trying to imagine it. I don't think I can. I mean, he's he's pleading for peace, right? He's pleading for nonviolence and their relationship, which I mean, yeah, you're forced to take him as word that he isn't perpetrating the violence to. Yeah. But at the end of the day, her response is very telling. Yeah, exactly. She's not saying then why do you keep hitting or anything like that? She's saying can't promise. I won't be physical with you. Exactly. Okay. And that's actually not even the most shocking one. There's this other clip. This one went viral as being shared all of her social media. And it really just paints her as an aggressor and abuser. And I like hearing this if you haven't already, it's shocking and I don't it'd be very shocking for career recovers from this. That's all I'll say. I said, no, tell them what just happened. Why? And that you punched me in the thing and you see in the face and you said, I didn't. What the **** are you talking about? And I watched you lie and then I sent you. And then anyway, you, I'm sorry that I didn't. You were a punch man. You across the face in a proper slap, but I was hitting you. It was not punching you, but you're not punched. Don't tell me what it feels like to be plunged to you. No, even a lot of times been around a long time. No, no, when you **** have a closed fist. You're punched. You're not hit. I'm sorry I hit you like this, but I did not punch you. I did not **** deck you. I **** was hitting you. You can't. I'm not the boat motion of my actual hand. What? But you're fine. I've not hurt you. I've not punched you. I was hitting you again. Amber heard kind of admitting that, yeah, she didn't abuse Johnny Depp, but there's also something happening here that's called gas lighting. If you guys aren't familiar with the term gas lighting, that's kind of when you undermine someone else's, I guess, assuredness of their own positions. Liam does this frequently, for example, sometimes I'll come in the room and I'll be like, oh, it's cold. Is the window open? He'll say, no, no, it's not open. I'm like, are you sure it's kind of cold? He'll tell me. He tells me it's psychosomatic. It's psychosomatic. It's psychosomatic. I'll take him at his word because I believe that relationships are built on trust later. I will find out the window actually is open. So that's gas lighting. Oh, men understand this place. She wants to, she wants to tropical temperatures guys. This is unreal gas lighting and we see this here. Different extremes. Obviously. We have her here. Like, no, no, I didn't punch you. I just hit you. Like I'm sorry, my fist wasn't like perfectly. It's like what? This is not. Well, that's like textbook abuser behavior. Yeah, exactly. That's like textbook. Like that's what they would write in textbook literally. That's that. As soon as you hear that, you're like, wow, this person is deranged. Because like Dr. Phil talks about this sometimes. It's like, instead of arguing, I guess issues, you argue semantics. Yes. And Johnny Depp cares about what the position of her hand was. I think he cares that he was being assaulted by someone who was in a relationship with she wants to argue what the position of her hand was. You know, she's telling him, no, you were fine. Don't be such a bit like if the role, the gender roles were reversed, I think people would find it even more shocking. I mean, even as it is, but I just, I want people to understand how terrible this is that she's saying these things. Oh my goodness. And yeah, we have another clip here. And I think this is just more of the same. And it really, I mean, he sounds so defeated in this Johnny Depp. He sounds really broken. Oh, yes. But let's hear it. Yeah. I'm sitting here. Am I? You are. That's a difference between me and you, your baby. Because you start physical fights? Because you start physical fights. I did start a physical fight. Yeah, you did. It doesn't make you a baby. No. You do not want to be abused or hit. Like the thing is, like, what does she want from him? He's running away when there's physical confrontation or potential for physical confrontation. It seems like to me, and again, the one thing I do want to stress is that we're only getting some audio of their relationship. Only they really know what happened. And, you know, I'm sure that he wasn't angelic in this relationship either. But I'm not, you know, I'm not saying he deserved any of this, but yeah. We don't know what happened. We don't know what happened. It's the end of the day. The reality is like what can I was just talking with Lauren about this. It's got to take a certain, a certain devil of a woman to, I mean, it takes a horrible man to beat a woman, but it also takes a horrible woman to beat a man. But she's a day's age. It's like you can't, you can't physically defend yourself in the slightest if you're a male, right? You will destroy your entire life if you even try. Yeah. And then, then of course, what she tried to destroy his life, alleging that he did these things. I think she did for the time, like at the time I happening, she was happening. She did destroy him. I mean, that's what makes it all the worse. We have this person who's talking about, no, I didn't really hit you. You were fine. Like I can't promise I'm not going to hit you again. And then later we have her coming out and pretending that she's the victim. Right. And it's sad because. And talking to him for being a coward for not engaging with her. Exactly. And she was. What do you want? Do you want to be hit? I like, you know, it's, that's what it sounds like to some degree, but she might have actually been thinking about this in advance. Well, I mean, that's how psycho she was, right? She was documenting all the times. Like she was hurt. She is the one who came forward and called him the abuser, which is, that's what makes it like abuse. He endured aside. This is what's even sadder for Johnny Debs. He wasn't the one who wanted any of this public it seems. She was the one who kind of, I guess, leaked these photos and these allegations to the press who caused this whole thing. And I mean, Johnny Debs had all these photos of himself the whole time. He still didn't release them. It's only now that he's going to court for this defamation suit that they're coming out. I feel bad not only because of what he endured in the relationship, but because he's had a piece of his private life that he probably didn't want other people talking about now made known for the entire world. So it's like he's been violated twice. It's, it's, it's really terrible. Yeah. And I guess the reason why we're talking about this specifically is because it does tie into cancel culture, which is something we've gone over before. You know, what goes on between them two. I guess, you know, courts are going to decide all of that. But let's talk about what we as an audience are, I guess, going to be doing, going forward because, okay, when Amber Heard came out, made the allegations of abuse, I do feel like it was a little bit different than the typical hashtag believe all women conversation because she did have photos, right? And I think a lot of people at the time, without knowing anything more, and, you know, without seeing the photos Johnny Depp at the time, we're saying, okay, that is proof that she was being abused. And if you're, you know, a movie goer, doesn't it make sense if you have proof that this one actor is actually a domestic abuser to not want to go see his movies? Like I can understand that. But now with like all of this new evidence, there's a, again, the hashtag justice for Johnny is trending and there's a petition now to have Amber Heard removed from Aquaman too. So is that fair? Should we now be boycotting her work instead? Should we just accept that the artist is different than their art? Probably let the law figure out what's going on first. And if they want to make it public, then they can. I mean, there is something boycodding that is actually inherently capitalistic, right? Yeah. So it is tough. If that's what people really don't want, they can't stand her. But I think it's on why it's just rest of these decisions. Again, we don't know what really happened. Yeah. We really don't. And I do want to stress that it does seem to me, based on the audio, that she was at least abusing him in some ways, sometimes. Yeah. Well, that's why. But that's only an intuition. And people have, like I said, there are still people who say, no, the only reason that she heard him is because she was defending herself and self defense and stuff. So I mean, I think it's fair to say that it looks like they were blows exchanged on both sides. To me, it seems disproportionate. Yeah. Like it kind of seems like they were starting in one direction. And with these move, like, I don't know, I guess, yeah, it would be great if we could just wait and see what the courts decide and maybe let that guide our decisions. But I mean, I admit I'm not for cancel culture, but I would find it hard to kind of like fully endorse or be excited about a movie with someone like her attached as, as, as with the information we know, I get it. I don't know if it's fair to call that cancel culture. Yeah. And I mean, there is that problem where the courts do tend to favor a special divorce, to tend to favor women. And then in case of domestic abuse, we know that that it's a hard time for men that are domestically abused, right? Like often the cops won't take it seriously. In fact, there are there's a what it's called, but there are there's like a protocol now when there's a domestic abuse situation, you remove the man. Yeah. Without quite you just remove the man from the right. Right. So there's a lot of things like that. And I think that if there's anything we could get from this case beyond just like the celebrity gossip stuff, which is not what I think we should care about. But it should be that you realize that men can be abused physically, domestically by women. It does happen. And it can be. It's not even it can be serious. And it's you know, it's not even that uncommon. First of all, it's a significant portion. It's it is the minority still, but it is a significant portion of abuse that is reported is is against men. So it's good to bring that to light. And I think that divorce courts certainly need to they need a lot of work. And it is, you know, the MGTOW and stuff like that came to rise because of this kind of because of the unfair treatment. So yeah. And if you're in a guy in that situation, even adds it's happening without worrying about the stigma of society, what do you do in that situation? You either get beaten by a woman or you're the guy who has beaten a woman by trying to fend her away from you. I mean, Johnny Johnny did the right thing. He left. He left himself from the situation. You know, you got to you got to get away from that. You still have this massive problem on your hands where what is the recourse after that? Yeah. And you guys, I guess we would love to know what you guys think about this, how you're going to be approaching either of their movies from now on. I don't know. I don't know what to do. I do love some Johnny Depp, though. All right. Before I move on to what is it? Anti Islamic hate speech. I have a quick message and update from freedom work. So you guys know today, Senate Republicans voted to acquit President Trump, which is overall a good thing for sure. However, the actions of one particular Senator, I think you know who I mean, were disappointing, not surprising, but disappointing. And I am, of course, talking about flip flop Mitt Romney, who voted to convict President Trump on the sham and peat and articles that the Democrats passed and Mitt Romney, by the way, was the only so-called Republican to do so. And he has the entire time he's been in the Senate, done nothing but attacked the president. So thankfully, my friends over at freedom works are launching a massive grassroots campaign to let the Senate to let the GOP know that despite what rhinos like Mitt Romney may say, they are behind this president. And if you'd like to help them, if you'd like to let your voice be heard, please text Lauren. That's my name, L-A-U-R-E-N to 41490 to sign their petition now. And by the way, it's not even as if Romney is a principal conservative who just happens to agree with Democrats on impeachment. Yeah, freedom works has this freedom works has this thing called scorecards where they rate Congressman based on how often they vote on the side of things like voting for lower taxes, less government, more freedom. You can check your Congressman scores at freedomworks.org. Mitt Romney score, as it turns out, I check this is a 62 out of 100. 62. Okay, where I'm from, that's three points away from a fail failing to vote on the side of less regulation. So where you're from, that's 90 points away from a, sorry, 28 points away from a failure. What no, when I was in high school here, it was 60. Not in your family. Oh, Asian math, right? That's true. But anyway, in either case, 62, not acceptable. And I'd say this conviction kind of puts them over the edge for a failing grade. So don't stay silent on this issue. People ask me all the time how they can get involved, how they can let their voice be heard, what they can do to make a difference. I'm telling you now, text Lauren, my name Lauren L-A-U-R-E-N to 41490 to sign their petition now. Okay, so we turn our eyes to Europe. A story coming out of France that sparked debate in the country about free speech versus hate speech. We have this article from the BBC. A teenager has sparked a national debate about blasphemy in France after an Instagram post calling Islam a religion of hate. Milla 16 posted her comments online after receiving homophobic abuse from a Muslim commenter. She received death threats and has not attended school since. But Milla has refused to back down saying in her first television interview that she wanted to blaspheme. She has since deactivated her Instagram account. The post has sparked a huge debate in France over freedom of speech. The country has no national blasphemy laws and has a rigidly secular constitution. Police initially opened two investigations, the first into whether Milla was guilty of hate speech and the second into her online attackers. They have since dropped the hate speech case as Milla was expressing a personal opinion on religion and not targeting individuals. On Tuesday, Interior Minister Christophe Castanner told the National Assembly that Milla and her family were under police protection. The controversy began on 18th January after Milla did a live broadcast on her Instagram account. After speaking about her sexuality, she was called a dirty lesbian by a Muslim commenter. In response, Milla posted an attack on Islam. I hate religion. The Quran is a religion of hate, she said, before using stronger words to attack Islam. I am not a racist. You cannot be racist towards a religion. I said what I thought, you're not going to make me regret it. Now, obviously, certain segments of the population, which I think you guys can identify, are very upset about this. There have been protests that I've seen. She's getting death threats, which is why she now has police protection as well as her family. I find it interesting, though, of the outrage I've seen regarding this case, people are very upset about what she said about Islam. I'm not hearing a lot of outrage about what was said to her for being gay, which I think is interesting. There's a hierarchy of arrests that need, I guess. Yeah, so, I mean, we have this LGBT team, for sure, but she is a white European. And not nearly as oppressed as, you know, let's say, a Muslim refugee. It's so laughable. A lot of other countries, they're probably stonier for that kind of stuff. For sure, not even just for saying what you said, but for being LGBT. Yeah, for being LGBT. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I mean, I didn't think her statement, the Quran is a religion of hate is a particularly bright statement. Well, I mean, the Quran is their, like, it's like saying Christ is their religion for Christians. Because, like, for Christians, Jesus is the word, but for Muslims, the Quran is the literal word. Yeah. I mean, again, I think that there's maybe you could argue semantics there, but I don't think that's in her mind. I think that she just literally confused the word Islam and, and I don't know. And apparently we don't have her full statement. Apparently she may have said some other things that she did end up apologizing for any vulgarity. But she said that she stood by her, I guess, main sentiments. Yeah. So obviously I'm on the side of free speech. You don't have a right to have your religion not be criticized. That does not exist. And this is another case where, yeah, the tensions between protecting LGBT people from hate speech and protecting Islam from hate speech is coming into conflict. It seems I'm glad to hear that, you know, the case against her has dropped. I'm not sure if the same would have been said if she had said such a thing in, let's say, Sweden or the UK. Because the thing about France is that obviously they don't have unlimited free speech protections like in the United States. No other country does, by the way, not the UK, not France, not Germany, not even Canada. Other countries do pay kind of lip service to free speech, but they always have kind of like caveats, little asterisks. Well, if you saw Merkel's recent speech, Germany is getting further away from that every day. Yeah, I feel like Germany, they just, they can't be chill. Like they're just an, I feel like extreme politics is kind of in their veins, one way or the other. I would love to see them find a nice middle ground someday. But then with France, is that even though they, they don't have this, I guess, view of free speech as an inherent human right that's unquestionable, obviously they don't because she was initially investigated for hate speech, which is like the fact that that would even happen. But like the article said, they're at the same time very secular. There are no blasphemy laws. So it's nice to see at least this time them fall on the side of free speech. Although I have to say if like it's even a question in your country that you may not be able to insult Islam without needing police protection, I think your, your country has problems. Oh, I definitely agree with that. I also want to add though that I don't think that the Muslim offender should be looked at, you know, for calling her. Oh, no, that's not a problem. I mean, you know, I mean, it was a nice, but it's not, it's not hate speech. It's not, it's ridiculous. But that's interesting. Yeah, because the Muslim commenter, as far as I know, wasn't investigated for hate speech. Okay. I do know that open an investigation. To the death threats. Yeah, but not to just the initial commentator. That's what I'm saying. But I don't think that might have been hate speech to some progressives, right? Yeah. Saying a dirty lesbian. You're being targeted for an immutable characteristic as a protected class. Yeah, for sure. I'm sure a lot of them will say that hate speech if they can serve to America and we're just saying something like that. Mm hmm. No, definitely. So I feel really bad for this teenager. I'm not sure what's going to happen for it. But I think the fact that this is such a big deal should be cause for concern, right? I mean, if we're at a point where police have to be called to protect someone based on something they said on Instagram live stream and they're 16, it's, it's already you guys have, you guys have a problem. So I guess best of luck to France. This is the first time in many, many months I've said that, like, and actually meant that in a positive way, good for you guys. You're not complete lefty fascist yet. Okay. Before we get to our next story, which is Carlos Mazza, I have a quick message from Laurel Springs. As parents, of course you want to encourage your children to pursue their dreams and provide opportunities that give them the best chance to succeed. Sometimes that means optimizing their routine, making it more flexible, more dynamic. So they have more time to focus on the things they love. That's why there's Laurel Springs. They are there to give parents and students a flexible schedule, strong academics and control over their or their children's education. Laurel Springs is an accredited online private school for students in kindergarten through 12th grade. They, they recognize that each child is a unique individual with their own personal interests, special talents, unique learning style. Their flexible learning program offers challenging and diverse elective courses. And Laurel Springs is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges and Advanced Ed, which means their transcripts are recognized by colleges and universities worldwide. We talked about the benefits of homeschooling all the time on the show when it comes to your child's education. Please don't just leave the decisions up to someone else. Take charge, register your child at laurelsprings.com slash Lauren today and receive a waived registration free registration fee. That's laurelsprings.com slash Lauren for your waived registration free waived registration fee laurelsprings.com slash Lauren. I got to say, that's a really cool sponsor. We talk about homeschool all the time. And I'm so happy to see that they're becoming, I guess more and more tools for parents who want to homeschool. Yeah, I agree with that. Like professional educators themselves, they don't know where to start, how to structure curriculum. Something like Laurel Springs is very cool. And actually I did homeschool for a little bit of high school. I really liked it. I guess enter comments saying that's why I'm socially awkward. But I actually, I do want to get to some of the comments here that I saw in the chat just to touch on our last segment. There was a lot of people talking to, not a lot of people. There's a few atheists in there saying all religions are inherently violent. Historically, religions are inherently violent. I'm seeing some ban on religions. And I just want to say. You're fascist. I just want to say that the people that have killed the most people in history, like the mouths and the Stalin's are atheists. And you guys are catching up quick. And atheism's only been around for a few hundred years. So I think that you know what is historically violent? Human beings. And I love that mentality. Religion is bad. Therefore, let's ban them. What are you going to do when Christians refuse to stop practicing, when Hindus refuse to stop practicing? What are you going to do that? It's kind of like, Calculating. And that that bender meme from Fudrama, they will learn of our peaceful ways through force. Like are you going to, I guess, ban this thing you view as violence, even potentially by violence? Like what are you, what are you going to do for that? And I think we've seen that the most, I guess, peaceful time that we're living in right now, it's not necessarily because of, I guess, any atheism or anything like that. Like the economic prosperity is is a huge indicator of peace and we're lucky to have that. I love these people who try to paint everything as all violence or conflict due to this one factor, right? Yeah. Socialist will say it's all class warfare. If we just abolish class, we'd all be peaceful. You know, identarians will say it's all race. You know, if we all just lived in our homogenous states, it would be peaceful. You know, some of the atheists say it's all religion. If there was no religion, we would all be peaceful. And some people will say like she did, she implied it's all Muslims or it's, you know, she said it's all religion too. But even saying it's all Muslim. Yeah, she said all, like she said, Islam is a religion of hate, right? Yeah. But I think there's a difference between saying that religion is hateful versus every ed human. Yeah. No. Well, yeah, I think there's a conflation thing going on there definitely, but there are different statements. And I think that she was wrong in saying that even herself. Yeah. So, but I think that it's important because religion is an institution made by men. All religions are. They're all flawed and it's vital that people like her and everybody else has the freedom to criticize them in order to fix their problems. Right. Yeah, for sure. And I mean, I think if the atheist community wants to start lecturing anybody about ideology, just look at yourselves, the whole atheism plus movement has in a lot of ways, embrace the same dogmatic behaviors that they criticize religious people for. Look at the Steve Shives of the world. I mean, there have been enough controversies within any atheism being too white, too male and all that stuff. I just think people have your right, a tendency to be violent. Regardless of what religion, race, gender, class, etc, that they are. All right. Now, speaking of intersectionality, Carlos Mazza. So I'm sure you guys remember who Carlos Mazza is. He's the one who essentially caused like by himself single handedly caused a new YouTube apocalypse, like for the entire YouTube community. Just because he didn't like what Stephen Crowder was saying about him. That went down this past summer, I think in July and after all was said and done, he actually ended up getting let go from Vox. He's back now, apparently, and he's launching his career as a YouTuber. And I'm sure with his history, he's going to definitely be just welcome back into the arms of the YouTube community for all he's done for people, not just political commentators. He screwed over everybody. Gamers, beauty channels, everyone felt, I guess, the brunt of what he did. Yeah, that was brutal. He gave this interview to the Verge. Carlos Mazza is back on YouTube and ready to fight. Last year, after setting off a firestorm around YouTube's harassment policies that even prompted a response from the company's CEO, Carlos Mazza disappeared from YouTube. Now he's back, but this time he's doing it all on his own. Mazza is leaving Vox.com, which produced his old show to become a full time media critic on YouTube. This YouTube situation that happened over the summer, before it happened, I think I made one video about YouTube. I wasn't interested Mazza says. It just happened to become inevitable to talk about the platform as it existed because it f'd with my ability to do my job. Now YouTube is one of the biggest threats. It's how a huge chunk of the public gets their news. And that's scary for him, by the way, because the left doesn't. Or at least it didn't use to control YouTube, which is why centrist, classical, liberal, or right-wing channels were thriving before they kind of got the ban hammer put on them. He continues, I effing hate that I have to use this platform because there's nowhere else to go. So this is exactly how we feel about YouTube, that they don't care about democracy. They're run by bad people. I would love to leave. And by the way, we are on other platforms. We are on Blaze TV. If you're a subscriber, you can always watch us there. We're on audio platforms. Google Play iTunes. We're on Google Play. We're on Google Play. We're on Google Play. We're on Google Play. We're on Google Play. We're on Google Play. We're on Google Play. We're on Google Play. We're on Google Play. We're on Google Play. We're on Google Play. We're on Google Play. We're on Google Play. Google Play iTunes. Spotify. We're working on others to expand even more. But YouTube is one of the main video viewing platforms. So, of course, unquestionably the main. I think it is the second biggest search engine on the internet. Yeah. So that is why we are here. We don't like it anymore than Carlos Masa does. But I think it's interesting that we're upset and a lot of channels are upset that they are kind of throttling pages based on the subject and positions they have, especially when it comes to politics. Our channel is experiencing this. Sarban Avakad just had to leave his original channel because it got throttled so badly. Stephen Crowder has experienced this. That's what we're upset about is that we don't have a chance to speak. What Carlos Masa is upset about is that he is not sufficiently silenced other people. That's right. Not upset at YouTube. He is just upset at YouTube for, I guess, allowing people to talk too much, which is not a thing you often hear about YouTube in the year 2020 when just the slightest criticism or wrong word can kind of get you shadow band, essentially. Your video won't show up in suggestions. You won't even be able to find it on Google through Google maybe. It won't get recommended. So, sorry, the article continues. Masa doesn't expect to earn much money from YouTube. I wonder why. I wonder why it's harder to earn money from YouTube now, Carlos. Instead, he's going to do what plenty of other creators on YouTube have done in the past use Patreon to find supporters and hope he can make enough to keep his channel going and pay rent. There's no ethical consumption under capitalism. There's no production under YouTube either, as it tells the Verge. My goal is that I can survive off of Patreon subscriptions and speaking gigs. I don't imagine a big chunk of my income will come from YouTube if there's a way so that not even YouTube would profit off them. I would be happy to. I love that. There is a way, actually, Carlos. I have a feeling you're going to monetize. Yeah, no, he definitely would. He was monetizing his content under Vox, too. That's ridiculous. If he really believed in this, he would join some commune, which there are hippie communes out there. Thanks for the fun one. So far, I have subscribed to his channel. I'm expecting that it will be a font of content in the future. So far, though, he only has one video, just like an introduction video, which I have watched. If you feel like going over there to check it out, maybe leaving a really nice comment for him. Very friendly, of course, because I don't support harassment. You can do that. So in this video, which I admit, it did make me laugh. It's kind of funny. Just so to be clear, I do not like Carlos Naza, not because he's gay or I think he's Cuban or something. I don't like him because he has a very smart, me personality. He does not have good morals. I'm an egalitarian. I'm judging him based on his weak character. He's funny. He's kind of funny, though. I chuckled. I chuckled. I know you guys aren't going to be happy with me for admitting that. But yeah, in his video, he has little alter egos that he plays. He's like himself, and one of them is like his left wing foil. And I just think it's interesting you guys can take a look at this. I'm making this video because it's time for me to do my own thing, to start my own channel and go fully independent. Hell yeah, baby. Going independent. Breaking free from the prison of corporate media and seizing the means of your own production. What's happening? I'm your left flank, baby. You're inner soy boy. And the socialist dreamboat you've always wanted to be. I'm Carl. Nope. There we go. There we go. Okay, first of all, I love this scarf. Really? I thought it was too much. So if you guys didn't catch that little reference car with the K, the car marks, the little end screen card, they're chaotic. Good. Because that's of course what you would define someone far left as the only good police or thought police again. Like that's funny, but scary. So like joke or not, could you imagine if on our show we had like a Nazi character? Like I dressed up as a Nazi to be like my right flank. And like I just I called myself Eva and I was like joking about Nazis and I'm like the only the only good Americans are white Americans. Could you just like for a magic? You shouldn't even that clip. I know it's bad to even say it because they because Carlos Maza's good. We're gonna pour it in us to YouTube right now. Yeah. Yeah, people like Maza specifically would lose their crap. I mean, these are the same people who think how dank you lies and Nazi. So I'm sorry, but I'm not giving him the benefit of the doubt for his comedy. No, not at all. You would do that for anyone else. So I mean, you'll see how he portrays the centrist shortly. Yeah, exactly. We can take a look at that now. One of his other little character is of course the dirty, dirty centrist. And again, comedy or not, I think it's very telling to see how he views centrist in this. Stop it. Who are you? I'm your right flank, baby. The reasonable centrist who believes in compromise. The classical liberal who only wants to protect freeze. And the swing voter, you're gonna lose with this soy boy bullshit. You can call me Charles. Wait a second. Do I actually have a little centrist inside of me? Buy me another drink and we'll see what happens. Oh, gross. Nice. Look, I'm your dramatic foil. Okay. You need a godless centrist. I'm your guy. You need a fascist bootlicker. Sign me up. Yeah, those dang boot licking free speech supporting centers, aren't they the worst? Yeah. He called them lawful evil too. Yeah, lawful evil literally the worst. Literally the worst. Oh, you find him in philosophy one on one. I thought that was neat considering the fact that I thought that you wouldn't find a marches anywhere near an economics class. Yeah. You know, if you look at the stats, that's pretty much what it says. Yeah, no, that's exactly what it says. Yeah. And I think one of the other things is like straight but out of spite or something. Yeah, no, you're laughing. See, it's funny. Even if it's like not purposely, it's kind of funny. Yeah. Clearly, he's one of those people who actually thinks that a centrist is a fascist and a like a bootlicker. That's what that means. And I love, I love the kind of like dark, like the free speech, like that dreaded free speech that's turning everyone into Nazis, right, Carlos? It's so and it's funny because it's like he's accusing other people of being extremists, of being radical. He literally has his like little Marxist character. He's accusing other people of like harassing on YouTube. He's literally trying to take down people's entire channels, launching like, I don't know, internet hashtag campaigns targeted toward a specific creator, someone who's on our network. And it's like the self awareness is like zero. That's right. And I mean, I think it was wrong. People when he got docs, people were texting his number. Yeah, I don't know. A group of that is wrong. That was 100% wrong. Yeah, for sure. But I think that he's just a slime ball and he's he's behaving like that right now. Yeah. Now that he's kind of he started this whole crusade against the YouTube community and their harassment policy, essentially to just burn it all down, right, to destroy the way that YouTube politics kind of happens that the commentary it now that he was he was fired from Vox. He didn't just leave. It was reported a while ago. They stopped production of a show. Now he doesn't have anywhere to go. So he's coming back here. I just think it's it's ironic. He has the gall to complain. Oh, I probably won't make money off of YouTube. Yeah. Because of people like you who make it impossible to monetize political content. He leveraged pride month to. Yeah, he did. He did during pride month. Said how YouTube was anti gay. I hear they use pride. Yeah, it's so slimy. Yeah, it's so slimy. And I'm interested to see what his other videos are going to be like because if he if he ever targets a single creator, I hope he he examines how he's interacting with these harassment policies too. Right? Because that's only fair. He's gone after specific people like Crowder in the past. He's done things on like, I think gosh, Tucker Carlson. He was on Vox before I'm interested to see I'm interested to see how his content will hold up under YouTube's new harassment policies now that he's just a lowly YouTube creator. Like so many other people. Do you think his videos are going to do well? Do you think like the left wing YouTube will kind of I guess tune into his videos because there are popular left wing creators on the platform? Yeah, definitely. Like a place he contra points. I don't know. He's going to hang with those guys. It's possible. It's definitely possible. I don't know how popular he is on the left, frankly, but I know that if he's only solely relying off the donation of communists, good luck. I know a bunch of them in real life. It's like the ones that that have the best jobs are in bands at age like 30. So yeah, have fun. So finally Catholic charities. All right, we've all heard the infamous like, bake me the cake, big it lawsuit where the Christian Baker refused to make the cake for the gay wedding. Then there was the wax my balls big it where Jessica, you need try to sue some estheticians who didn't want to wax male genitalia. Now the latest iteration we have perform my gender reassignment surgery. Big it. Okay, so a Catholic hospital is being sued for refusing to perform a hysterectomy on a trans individual, someone who was born a woman biologically and is identifying as a man. So we have this from B word media. I don't even know if we can say it. Yeah, I'll just call it that is it is the word that runs with it. Yeah, female dog media. So here Catholic hospitals are barring transgender patients from surgery. So just right there. You think, Oh my goodness. And I've heard other people talk about stuff like that, how trans people are being denied surgery. But then when you read it, it's like, Oh, a certain hospital or doctor doesn't want to perform gender reassignment surgery. Because like when I saw that headline, I was like, is a trans person being denied, you know, some sort of like triple bypass surgery or other type of life saving surgery, because that's wrong. You shouldn't be allowed to do that. However, there's a difference between that and saying, I don't want to perform your gender reassignment surgery, which is what is happening here. So the article says Evan Minton had been planning his gender confirmation surgery at Mercy San Juan Medical Center in Sacramento, California for months, two days before the procedure a nurse calls for Mercy San Juan to check in with him and ask routine health questions. That's when Minton explained over the phone that he's transgender. The next day a hospital official called him to cancel his surgery. Mercy San Juan deemed a hysterectomy for a transgender patient, a form of sterilization. And that wasn't a procedure the hospital could perform because it's a Catholic institution. The hospital does permit hysterectomies for others, however, Dr. Lindsey Dawson, Minton's physician says that she has performed the procedure at Mercy San Juan before, and that the hospital's decision to cancel the surgery is discriminatory. Okay, so just to stop here, there were a couple of things that I wasn't sure about and I kind of looked into it. So some of you guys might be wondering, why was the surgery canceled so late? If I'd been planned for months and only like a few days before to the hospital check in. From what I understand, like doctors or surgeons can perform at different hospitals. So I think this doctor, they were going to do the surgery at this hospital, but it wasn't like, I don't know how to explain it. It was more that this trans patient was working with this individual doctor who happened to book a surgery at this hospital rather than, I guess, the doctor being a dedicated physician solely at the hospital treating trans individuals, if that makes sense. Because I know it was a bit confused about that at first. And just to clarify what a hysterectomy is, it's when you remove a female's uterus. It's not a trans-specific surgery, cervical cancer, endometriosis, uterine prolapse on the more serious side. I think there are reasons why women get hysterectomies. I know some people are wondering why the hospital would even agree to perform the hysterectomy surgery if they don't do reassignment surgeries. It's not just for reassignment, which is why I think this doctor was saying she had performed hysterectomies at this hospital before. And so, but for trans people specifically, the hysterectomy. I guess it's a de-gid and elective surgery basically. Yeah, elective surgery, which amounts to sterilization, which because they are Catholic, they won't do. And yeah, for a trans individual, obviously, hysterectomy, it gets rid of your period, it means you can't get pregnant. It is part of their transition. But yeah, so that's what happened. Article continues, Mitten is now suing Dignity Health, the hospital's parent company, claiming that withholding the surgery because of his gender identity violates California's Unruh Civil Rights Act. I'm not sure if that's a typo or I just don't know anything about California civil rights, which specifically outlaws discrimination in housing and public accommodations based on sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, or sexual orientation. The hospital has defended its decision to cancel Mitten's surgery, citing their religious protections within the First Amendment and their adherence to the ethical and religious directives that guide Catholic hospitals and their care set forth by the US Conference of Bishops. In fact, this is where things get fun, guys. No papal address has mentioned transgender health care, and it is not covered in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, a book written by the Vatican in 1992 and promoted by Pope John Paul II that sums up Catholic beliefs. In June 2019, the Vatican released a document titled Male and Female He Created Them, which affirmed that the Church believes in the binary existence of men and women, but only mentioned the word transgender twice and didn't mention gender confirmation surgery at all. It's unclear yet if the new document will have an effect on policy going forward. I love how they're trying to argue, like, is it even against Catholic doctrine though? It's like, yeah, someone who has no idea what the hell they're talking about. No idea. You know, clearly, they don't understand the other doctrines, like things about using, you have to be open to life. That's one of the doctrines for Catholics. In case you didn't know why some people have like 20 kids, open to life means nothing, right? Yeah, not a family planning is it. That's it. I don't know. Allegedly, that's effective if you do it correctly. Yeah, but that's why I mentioned the whole math thing. Yeah, there's you need to do some counting involved. I guess some people aren't as into that. But yeah, so that's the thing. The church is kind of arguing, okay, this is a sterilizing procedure. We're not going to do this, which is this should not shock you if you're at all familiar with Catholicism. These people are saying, no, it's part of my gender reassignment surgery. Why can't you give me this? That's not against your Catholic teachings, which is also not true, right? Because I don't know why you would think that the Catholic church is on board with the idea that you can get surgeries and live as another person and like kind of have that recognized that's not that I've not seen the Catholic church enforce that in any way, shape or form. And it's actually, sorry, so they continue. And this is what I guess troubling about the case, Mitten's case and the rapid expansion of Catholic health care systems overall comes at a time when conflicts about religious freedom and health care are taking center stage. In January, 2018, the US Department of Health and Human Services created a new conscience and religious freedom division in their office for civil rights that works to ensure that health care employees don't have to provide medical services they oppose on religious grounds. Transgender advocates fear that the conscience rule will allow even more providers to opt out of providing care to those in need. In a survey conducted in 2015, we already found that one out of three trans people have had issues with their health care provider says Jillian Branson, brand center, the media relations manager for the national center for transgender equality. This rule will just make it worse and inherently encourage discrimination against transgender people. Advocacy groups for transgender rights are concerned about the widespread impact of these directives as well. No one should have to wonder about their hospital's religious affiliation in relation to treatments, transgender, non-centered, or non-centered. No one should have to worry about having their treatments or health care interrupted. Now what I think is, again, we're going to talk about this. In my opinion, I think most people's opinions, there is a difference between saying I will not treat this trans person or give them health care versus I will not perform this elective surgery on this on this trend. What those issues with health care mean? Is it the Jessica you need complaint? They would not wax my genitals? There's a lot of nuance in there. I mean, if they're denying someone actual life-saving health care, there's a trans person who's coming with a bullet wound and they're saying I won't help you, you're trans, that is wrong. By the way, it would not happen. And it would not happen. Yeah, that's for sure. Definitely the other things, these kinds of transitionary surgeries. But this isn't the exact, like, the conflation of terms we saw this with the baker as well. They were saying he won't serve this gay person because he's gay. No, no, he won't bake this specific cake for the specific event because it violates his religious beliefs. He's happy to serve him in other ways. And it seems like the hospital is taking a similar approach. We will not do this specific surgery for this individual, but the individual can still access other forms of health care. Yeah. So it's not the same thing. I also think that there's just a lot of crap in that article, like talking about the rapidly expanding Catholic health care system. Because if it's sinister, they make it sound bad. Yeah, sinister. First of all, if it is expanding anywhere, it's probably in developing nations with a literally on missionaries going out to help places that generally need medical help, right? In the Western world, even if they were making new hospitals, like thank you. Yeah. But typically what's happening is these places historically, especially in the place of Canada, Canada is way more Catholic than the States. Especially like French Canada, Eastern Canada, especially. Yeah. And it's extremely Catholic. And when people came over, the nuns, literally they ran the health care system. All the hospitals from that time, they're all run by some kind of Catholic institution, but from that time. And the nuns, guess what? There aren't too many people becoming monks or nuns today. They've actually started handing over these institutions as they're starting to get old and die to secular organizations. So I don't even think that this is in the West, that's a false statement, definitely. Well, what frustrates me about this is that you see people like this where they're trying to sue a Catholic church into doing something that violates their religious convictions. I don't think they get that a lot of, like they would rather shut down than have to do this. Like you are telling them to do something that is unconscionable. And I think it's a good idea that it like, yeah, if you don't want to perform the article also went into how some Catholic hospitals are being sued for not wanting to perform abortions. Yeah. And I think they think, yeah, if you don't want to perform the abortion, if you don't want to perform the gender reassignment surgery, then you should be shut down. And that's frustrating to me, especially like when my dad's side of the family was in Hong Kong, my uncle got polio at the time there was another places they could go. Guess who treated him Catholic hospital, right? And I think they're so obsessed with this whole like the gender ideology or the pro abortion stance that they're unable to see anything else positive that could come from these hospitals because they can't get what they want from it. So they don't want anyone to have any access to it. Yeah. And one of the things that is nice about about I'm Catholic, by the way, in case you didn't know yet, but one of the families now Catholic. Yeah. Yeah. Is that there's certain lines that when you cross with them, they'll just they'll just say no. Yeah. And some of them are things like this. Other ones might be like covering up pedophilia sometimes. So that's bad. Yeah. But you know, things like this, it's just like it's, it's they'll stand their ground at least. And I think it's unfair for these, these people to criticize the way they're doing charity work, right? Because a lot of these hospitals, they are, you know, I'm not saying that like no one pays, but there are a lot of charitable services that come out of these hospitals. And actually, this isn't the first time we see this resentment against Catholic or more broadly Christian charities for not doing charity the way progressives want them to do charity. We saw this recently with the issue of adoption. So there's been controversy surrounding Christian or I guess more broadly religious adoption agencies refusing to adopt two same sex parents. Some people have fought to block state funding and contracts from these agencies will now certain states have kind of, I guess, put into place legislation to ensure Christian charities can still operate according to their conscience. We have this from NBC News. Tennessee governor says he will sign anti gay adoption bill. That's a very interesting way to phrase this. What actually happened was Tennessee governor Billy announced Tuesday that he'll sign into law a measure that would assure continued taxpayer funding of faith based foster care and adoption agencies, even if they exclude LGBT families and others based on religious belief. A handful of states today have enacted similar legislation, including Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Alabama, South Dakota, North Dakota, Virginia, Mississippi and Michigan, but Michigan agreed in settling a lawsuit to no longer turn away LGBT couples or individuals because of religious objections. And then similarly from USA Today, Tennessee governor, Billy, who was that the same thing? No, it's a different. Okay. In the same place, but yeah, under the law, which immediately takes effect, the state would be barred from denying an agency's license or grant application for public funds because of a refusal to place a child with a family based on religious objections. Okay, so I did a poll on this the other day, and most people favored letting faith based agencies operate an exercise judgment on family placements, but they, they didn't want them to be able to receive funding. Yeah. I mean, I think what that is, the funniness is it's, it's a portion of their income, which they probably desperately need. Yeah, but most of it is funded by the church. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So do you think they should be able to receive funding? Like even these Catholic hospitals, I guess we can like kind of group it together. If there was a Catholic or Christian charity that operates their charity based on their religious convictions, should they still be able to receive federal funding? Well, here's the question. Who else is going to do it? Yeah. Right. If you're going to set up your own charity, be my guest, but we know that's not going to happen, right? Yeah. Especially with those types of people. We just know we've seen the stats. We've seen the data who gives more to charity. Yeah. Typically, first of all, conservatives versus progressives. And Christians versus atheists as well. Christians versus atheists. Definitely. We look at some of the largest charitable organizations. They're disproportionately Christian. Yeah. So I mean, at the end of the day, if you deny these organizations, whatever, probably a lot of it is like taxation benefits, things like that. It's the orphan tool software. That's what I think. Well, I mean, I guess the progressive rebuttal for that is if they really cared about children, they would be adopting to these families, aren't they just like spitefully keeping children like parentless? I think that they just think that it's none of the child's best interest. Yeah. And I think the thing is like, unfortunately, there are a lot of children in these, you know, foster homes or at these adoption agencies, there's not a dearth of children. You can go somewhere else, right? There are other adoption agencies who will adopt to them to say that because this one agency will not adopt to me, it should not receive any more funding. You are going to hurt the child eventually because there are too many people out there who need homes. And I know people will say, well, if there's so many, then just adopt to the same sex parents. Again, even with sex parents taking the kids, there are just so many. I think hopefully something everyone can agree on is that let's make the adoption process easier. Let's maybe try to reduce the number of kids who are in these foster care programs, which like love or hate the Catholics, you cannot blame, I guess, foster kids on them. Like they've made it very clear they don't think you should be having sex outside of marriage, right? They think it's a sacred thing to be done within a family. Like, and I've seen people do blame Catholics for all the kids out there because they don't support abortion or adopting to gay families. And it's like, if you were, you listen to the Catholics on this, but if you listen to them on everything, there would be fewer kids out there for sure. Well, I mean, more in Catholic families, but you know, less looking for adoption. I guess to leave off something else I wanted to touch upon with the hospital thing is that a lot of progressives I've seen in this happen when I tweeted out the article were saying that by denying this gender reassignment surgery, they are denying essential health care. Like they make, they consider anything that they would. It would be like denying someone who's going through a heart attack, life saving heart surgery. That's how they do it. Yeah, but they're wrong. Yeah, they are. I do believe that. And especially like if this person was able to wait months for an appointment, wait, like choose another hospital. I don't think it should be too much to say, hey, be more clear with the hospital. I would actually blame the doctor specifically for not thinking about this rather than just the patient. I completely can see why the person would have just assumed that the doctor would know what they were doing. I'm interested to see how this will play out in courts though, because I think it's going to make a huge difference if they're not allowed to deny gender reassignment surgery. I don't see how they would in the future be denied the right to do things like refuse abortion. So we shall see. That's pretty much all we have to say for now though.
