    "text": " And there's nothing going on tonight. We can't even sit here like that. Maybe just get drunk and stay inside. Good afternoon Michael Malice here. Let that be your welcome for the next hour. We have with us a very special guest. A returning guest, popular YouTuber Blair White. She's the host of the new podcast The Blair White Project. Yours truly got to be the first guest. She's got a, oh, I screwed us up a second time. She's got over a million subs on YouTube. So you should follow her there on Instagram, Twitter, everywhere else. Blair, thank you so much for coming back to the show. So what do you mean by special? You know what I mean. Sure. Okay. Okay. So first of all, you have cursed me. So for people who don't know, Michael makes send me for a lot of things, but my nails are the biggest thing. I've been in the past 20 seconds before sitting down to do this. I lost a nail and you always make fun of me that I never have 10 nails on. Literally a few seconds before I sat down. Yeah, but you could still count to 10. Barely. So I want to talk to you because Matt Walsh is documentary. What is a woman has been getting a lot of accolades. There's a book with the same regard. You watched it. You made a video about it. You gave it for spoiler. You gave it 4.9 out of five stars. I watched it as well. I thought it was very well done. So we're going to start with the first question. What is a woman? An adult human female and a trans woman is an adult. Human male who presents as a woman. So one of the things you and I talk about often, or you talk about in your videos and in your interviews is. You seem to be feeling that because of so much of this push to. Push trans issues anywhere and everywhere, especially with kids. This is causing a big backlash towards average Americans. Against those who would otherwise be accepting of LGBT issues. Can you talk about that a little bit? Yeah, I mean, it just shows in the numbers. LGBT acceptance has been declining for the first time in almost a decade. And I don't think it takes really a super intuitive person to understand that there's a lot of things that are being shoved in people's faces that are illogical like the trans athlete thing like the trans kid thing. I think that what the right gets wrong is that they assume that transgenderism or transsexualism is an invention of the modern left or a post modernism. That's not the case trans people have been around forever. And you know that because you're a more well versanology media history than I am. But I understand the misconception because like every other group, the left, you know, coops them and then turns into some crazy shit. But the problem with this group in particular is that most trans people just want to get on to get on like they have like not a lot of them are public figures. They're not outspoken. And you definitely risk your entire social group as a trans person by speaking out against this stuff because most trans people only hang out with other trans people. So they've co-opted a group that doesn't act isn't actually willing to speak up for themselves. The kid thing is a big thing. And the movie honed in on that which, you know, I rated it a 4.9 because I felt like it was full of useful information. I learned from it and I'm someone who's a very well versed in this stuff. So for me to actually learn new things. That's a little bit rare. So I really enjoyed the movie. I know that Matt Walsh is a super contentious figure. But so am I. And I think a conversation is probably overdue for Matt and I. I think currently he's kind of we follow each other. But I think he kind of pretends like I don't exist. I'm pretty sure how about Matt. I'm pretty sure I have the most viewed review of his movie that exists on the Internet. And he was like quote treating people with like a thousand views on their reviews. So I'm like, I know you saw it, Matt. So I think a conversation should happen. I don't really know how he feels about trans adults because they think that's a separate conversation. And 12 year olds going on, you know, permanent medicalization. So it'd be interesting. So I want to talk to you about someone who's actually have experience with these issues about some of the claims that are being made and both your perspective and your kind of informed experience. Isn't it true that puberty blockers, which is what they're giving to kids to prevent those who identify as trans as kids from achieving puberty is a temporary thing. It's just like pressing pause on a YouTube video. And if the kid changes his mind later, they can just unpause it and they can go through puberty just normally like everybody else. Not true at all. And that's probably the wildest claim. There's a lot of gas lighting that goes on as they've heard would say on this topic. There's a lot of things that are said that. About two years after they're said and they're the main talking point, they just kind of disappear. They'll tell you something isn't happening. So for years, they were saying no kids are actually medically transitioning. It's just social transitioning who would have a problem with kids dressing up. I don't know. We have a problem with kids dressing up, but that's not the truth. People are just going to be like, oh, I'm going to be like, why? Because it's a big deal. But there's no problem with the trust. Tuberty blockers are definitely not. Or they're not temporary. I mean, there are some temporary aspect. So if you go off of them, you will start puberty. But the idea that starting puberty, if you decide to go off them at 15, it's going to be the same as if you naturally had it occur at 12 or 13. Is just not the cage. There's a lot of. to reproduce this stunted. That's especially true with hormone replacement therapy, which always follows the puberty blockers. You know, puberty blockers are temporary only in a sense that you take them for a short amount of time. But the effects are lasting. And this is a drug, which is Lupron. This is a drug that has been historically used to castrate pedophiles. So the idea that it's this sort of like mainstream consensus now that this is a drug appropriate for children, for the sake of altering their bodies permanently, is very scary. And I think that eventually it's gonna come to a tipping point where people kind of look back at this as one of the most heinous, you know, things to come out of the medical community in decades. But until that happens, I think there's gonna be a lot of kids really messed up for men and you're already seeing it. You know, I've interviewed a ton of D-transitioners on my channel. I was one of the people who kind of pushed that topic to the forefront. My most popular videos I've created are on that topic, talking to these kids who have gone through this medicalization and they've tried to turn back, they tried to stop. And there's just so many permanent effects, whether it's the voice, whether it's the height, whether it's, you know, when you transition to a very young age, I'm sorry if I'm answering too many questions at once, but when you transition to a very young age, you never achieve sexual gratification. And when you talk about that, what the supporters of children transitioning will say is, well, why are you concerned with whether or not they can have sexual gratification? As if that's not a very important, healthy part of being a human being. And then obviously you're sterilized as well through this medicalization. You know, I transition as an adult and I can't have kids. So, well, you're saying obviously, but I don't think it is obvious. I don't think people put two and two together that if someone has transitioned as a kid or, you know, blocked their puberty and later they change it, they might permanently have lost their ability to have children of their own. And this is something that, from my experience with you, you're telling me that these kids are in a parent's even aren't being informed that this is a possible side effect, correct? Yeah, I'm absolutely wrong to say it's obvious. I think it's obvious to me because I'm so involved in this topic in this world, but you're right, it's not so obvious, but that's unfortunate. You know, the reality is there's these stories from these young kids that come out that are just like the most insane stories and they're true of the problems with getting these surgeries at a young age. You know, the place that I transitioned at in Plano, Texas, this is Texas, by the way, I was there recently taking my friend to take care of her. Well, she got her surgery, she's an adult. And I was informed that they were doing operations on kids as young as 14. And then Sidney Waughton further looked into that same clinic and it's actually 12 that they're doing double mastectomies on underage girls. So this is something that people are absolutely going to look back on as something that's horrible and the people who supported, I think, are eventually gonna have to pretend like they didn't because talk about being on the wrong side of history. I rarely invoke that argument, but when it comes to like permanently just figuring kids, like I think there is a right and wrong side of history on that topic. Well, isn't, okay, so the argument is if these kids aren't getting what they call gender affirming surgeries, these kids are gonna be a suicidal and by preventing them from getting these surgeries that their gender dysphoria tells them, you are the one who is abusing the kid. Right, right, you're the abuser. If you think that that's too young for these kids, you're gonna be medicalized for life, which I won't say it's obvious, but a reminder that it is a medicalization for life. I'm on estrogen for the rest of my life. Minus, I think, the age when it's appropriate that biological women go on menopause, I think that I'm supposed to slow it down, but not cut it off. I figured that out when I'm older, I guess. But yeah, you're called the abuser if you disagree with it, but in reality, the lawsuits are gonna come out of this. I think you told me this a while ago and I kind of thought about it, I was like, you're so right. The lawsuits that come out of this are gonna be just giant. I mean, you can't completely destroy a healthy body and think that there's no recourse, whether it's politically or law suits. One of the things that was passed as the law in California is that if you are someone who's having issues with your gender and go to therapy, it is illegal for the therapist to discourage you from transitioning. So the argument is isn't that important because otherwise you're gonna have the equivalent of kind of, you know, pray the gay way stuff and you're going to be causing only more ideological suffering. What is wrong with that law in your opinion? Well, this is the thing. It's so what you have now, which has actually historically never existed when it came to diagnosing people as trans and my dear friend Buck, Angel Kinetes, talked about this all the time. What we now have is affirmative care and you have affirmative therapists, gender affirming therapists who are literally there and their sole purpose is to say, yes, you are correct or transgender under Indian all circumstances because it is seen as conversion therapists say anything but that when in reality, I think you can kind of look at the complete opposite way, which really is the big deal with all of this. Just like you said, you're the abuser if you disagree. It's backwards for them. I think it's conversion therapy to tell a possibly young gay or lesbian gender nonconforming, you know, tomboy or feminine boy that they must be transgender or they must assume a different gender identity simply because they have those traits when in reality, I guess it's a bit difficult to understand if you've never had gender dysphoria, but it's a lot deeper than like, I like pink or, I like to play sports, but I'm a girl. But that's what these kids are being told. And if you push back at all, you're seen as participating in conversion therapy, which it's one of those things no one wants to be complicit with. You think of conversion therapy with gay people and this is something that most people have come to understand is a very horrible thing. Tons of abuses in that industry for lack of a better word and it doesn't work flat out. But in the past, when it came to diagnosing people as trans which entails permanent surgeries and permanent life-long medicalization, there was a process that entailed pushback. There was a process that entailed, well, you may be misconstruing these feelings based on childhood traumas. And now the idea that being trans has anything to do with childhood traumas, that's a very taboo and therapists simply don't do it. So, there's a lot of issues, it's like a perfect storm. You have all these kids, the extreme spike and people identifying as transgender. I don't have the numbers on me, but people, those numbers are always sown around. It's because there's no safeguards anymore. And when there's no safeguards, there's gonna be malpractice. And when there's malpractice, there's gonna be people's lives ruined. And potentially, being trans in general, the concept, like adult transitioning, having that freedom to do what they want with their bodies, I could foresee being threatened. I could foresee a situation where the pendulum swings so far that suddenly it becomes illegal to transition as an adult. And we have sort of state-by-state laws similar how we do to abortion. I don't want that, obviously, because I believe adults can do what they want. But I think people are gonna start conflating the kid and the adult issue and just say it to hell with all of it, which is gonna be an issue. One of the things I'm a little old than you obviously are a lot older than you, but growing up, I think pretty much every girl I knew, I mean, girl as a teenager, had an eating disorder phase. It was usually a mild one, they outgrow it. It's not people who don't understand. It's not about literally the eating disorder. It's about control, losing sense of control in your home, feeling a sense of control of your changing body. This is extremely common. But nowadays, and I really would like to hear your input if I'm completely talking on my ass, it feels like, okay, if you are a young female or a young male who feels uncomfortable with their body, like right away you're told, oh, you're comfortable with your body, your trans, the difference within eating disorder is you can go back to having a healthy approach to food or a healthier approach to food. You start making yourself throughout for taking laxatives, you start eating more, maybe getting healthier food choices. But if you are transitioning when you're taking hormones, getting surgeries, that is much more irreversible than fixing an eating disorder. Do you see these parallels as kind of, this is like the 2.0 version of having anorexia or am I just completely crazy? You're not crazy at all, at least not for that. It's absolutely true. And this is why you see the rise in transgenderism within that same population of teenage girls that suffer with eating disorders, body image. It used to be completely flipped that the trans issue was something that afflicted young boys at a rate that was almost double young girls. Now it's the opposite. If that's not suspicious in the slightest to people, I don't really know what they're thinking. But when it comes to the eating disorder thing, I have seen people say that, you know, allowing someone to transition and assume this new body or this new gender, at least in the way they present, you know, it's similar to if we were just to say, yeah, continue to start yourself, continue to present that way and be skin and bones and whatever. And I don't blame people for having that perspective because I understand where they're coming from. However, this is why I think that transition is a last resort. When I decided to transition, it was a last resort. If I could have been happy and healthy living as a boy and being presented and presenting as a boy and being seen that way, I would have chosen that in a heartbeat, which is why the idea that jumping to transition as the first resort is incredibly problematic. I pretty much sat myself down and had a real like come to Jesus moment when I decided to transition and said, is this something that I could do without in my life? Could I figure out a way to navigate this life without it? I couldn't, I couldn't. But I also made that decision as an adult who can foresee the future and I started to plan my future whereas these children cannot. So they might come to the same conclusion but that's because of their children, not because they have an extreme version of dysphoria. Does that make sense? Yeah, of course. Let's get a little bit graphic because there's an issue people tap dance about and this was brought up in the documentary, which is this that if someone decides that they're trans, the next thing that they do and they're going to the doctor and having their general cutoff, what is wrong with that kind of view of gender dysphoria? Well, I can't say what this first step is with all these like this new wave of people that are trans coming in, that might be the first image I'm to. I'm sorry, I just, how is that different from someone saying I'm trans disabled, cut off my arm? Oh, oh, okay, I know Amy now. Well, I guess to an extent it's not, I personally, and this is where a lot of trans people think I'm crazy. I don't want that operation ever. I do see that as something incredibly brutal to do to yourself. I do kind of see it in the same way of like hacking off an arm because that's a healthy organ that exists there for a reason. And some people are very lucky with the results of the surgery. Some people are not. I guess the argument would be, in a perfect world where the science is all there, you can have a healthy functioning vagina, although it's a neo vagina. So it's not the same as if you had to cut off your arm and then suddenly you don't have an arm to grab things and go about your day or a leg to walk. So these things are a lot more detrimental to like your existence than that. But I mean, this new way of a trans people, I don't know what it's going to be, but I also know that a lot of trans women in particular do not get the surgery. I would say 90% of the trans women I know don't get it, don't have a plan to get it. Some of them lie and say they do have it because for some reason people seem to get more respect if they have that surgery, or at least to them, they think they'll get that. But I mean, I'm avoiding that surgery at all costs. And also this is another thing. One thing I really took away from the movie is transitioning from male to female is so much less brutal than female to male. In the sense of, you know, when I transitioned, I never removed anything. I only added really, whereas when you're a young girl and you're going and you're removing bodily parts, you know, the surgery, even though it's so flawed from male to female genitals is so much more flawed for female to male. And I got the feeling, although this could have been the bias of the movie, that there are a lot more health complications that come along with transitioning from female to male than the other way around. There was someone interviewing the movie talking about how every other month they have a life-threatening infection they have to deal with, and it was crazy. Yeah, so let's talk about that argument. So the argument is basically, if you get this, you know what they call bottom surgery, it's indistinguishable from someone who'd been born female and having those genitalia. And the science is there so they can do it and you're fine like the next day. Like, is that an accurate representation of the state of affairs? Well, no, that's the other problem. You mentioned earlier that these people that are transitioning, both adults and children are not getting the proper information because it's not as if when you go to get their surgery, they tell you, this is not going to be a vagina. This is going to be a neo vagina. And here's the things that come along with that. Here that, you know, I think that there is this fantastical sort of perception of it that you literally can switch your sex through this surgery. And this is literally not the case. In 2022 at least, who knows what they're going to have in 2080, you know what I mean? But as of now, what you're getting is a wound that resembles a vagina that is your responsibility to keep open. And I don't know how graphic you want to get. If you can get as graphic as you want, describing how to do that. Yeah, well, how do you keep the wound open? Yeah, you have to put, I don't want to get you to do more than I've. Toy is inside of you, almost daily for a very long time. So this is something that I feel is obviously common knowledge. It has to be common knowledge. I mean, people have had this surgery, but this is something that's not discussed when good morning America starts, or Fox even has starts talking about trans kids. So someone who has this surgery who has gone from male to female, it's not literally a female organ. It is a wound and the body wants to heal that wound and they have to take steps on a daily basis to make sure this wound does not heal itself and resolve. Yes, and there's so much that goes along with that, like infections, we just want to get real graphic. You have to have electrolysis on your male genitalia before you turn it into female genitalia because if you have even one or even a few hairs left on that part of your body, what they do is they flip it inside out. So you're going to have hairs growing inside of it. And listen, I'm not going to pretend as if the results are always just so heinous because I've seen decent results on friends. I know people that have had decent results, but the reality is it's far from perfect. And I would say most people that I know that have gotten it have encountered some sort of a complication. But that's not the case with so many other surgeries, right? Like we have so many surgeries that you get it and you're good and there's no problems. But with this one, there seems to always just be problems. And you're right, good morning America, the corporate media, the way they present, trans kids is they do this very fluffed up, very inspirational, very, how could you ever think this kid needs to be anything other than trans sort of story. And there's so much ugliness that goes along with transition and it's like, I think that people just don't understand what they're putting kids through when they do it. And what's crazy is that now these kids are coming out and now these like 17, 18 year olds that are already going back on their decision to transition their decision are able to talk about it. And it's crazy kind of knowing that that was going to happen for years because I started talking about this like years ago when no one was talking about it and there really were not a lot of them. But I said, watch in two or three years, you're gonna have all these kids coming out, it's gonna be a huge scandal. I'm not so happy that's what's happening now. Now you have Tucker Carlson doing interviews with each transitioners, which I think is great. And I think that the right has been absolutely justified in going hard on this issue because it is absolutely insane. I mean, the idea that kids had it were anything to do with trans in the past would have been seen as like ludicrous. I think it's a lot easier for people to understand adults doing what they want with their body than kids. Let's get back to the show. Okay, so let's push back a little bit. Like here's a criticism of you that I've seen that you're a hypocrite. You were on Rogan when you're saying that you were four or five when you first had these issues of gender dysphoria. If you had gotten your puberty blockers, you wouldn't have had to have some of these surgeries. And basically you're denying to other people what it would have been beneficial for yourself had it and you have internalized transphobia. Yeah, this is like the big one that people think they just totally have me on because on Rogan, he asked me, when did you start feeling different? And I said around four or five because what I've said since the beginning of my career when talking about this issue, this is this issue I've been very consistent on, by the way, it's the trans kid thing. What I've said that my story is that of course, it felt different at that age because trans people kind of always do. Like just because I'm talking about kids that are getting funneled into this thing incorrectly, doesn't mean they're on actual trans people. Buck Angel has the same story he felt that way. And he also disagreed with kids transitioning. I could have felt it in my bone marrow that I want to transition. That does not mean that I should have been allowed to. That doesn't mean I was able to consent to it. That does not mean with all the chaos of even just a regular upbringing in childhood that I would have also added in and medically transitioning and that would not have been disastrous for me. If you want to be real, there are kids that get sexual urges very, very young. Does that mean they can consent to sex just because they have those urges or their desires or those feelings? No, is it different? Yes, is it kind of similar if you think about it? Kind of it comes down to whether or not a kid can consent to something. And I don't think permanent body modification is one of those things. One of the things I am concerned about as well is there's a huge swath of the population and this is a big narrative just across corporate media that people don't respond to incentives. Like they just basically pretend that whoever advocates for something is doing something coming from a place of truth. This is completely in my opinion, the exact opposite of how human beings behave. That when people tend, the statement people tend to respond to incentives is not only true, it's tautological. It's irrefutable. That's what incentive means. Something that encourages people to act in a certain behavior. The glorification of trans people in the media, Pride Month, you know, it's kind of everywhere. Oh, look, we found one. Let's put it on the box of Trident. Or, you know, it was really kind of funny. I was taking an Uber and there was some radio DJ and it was Pride Month sponsored by TIDE, like detergent. And it was like, this is like the, I remember I talked to Michael Alec who was the club kid killer when I visited him in jail and he was doing these talk shows before he was out of it as a killer. And he was just like, like when they were interviewing us on these shows, he's like, I knew they were just there to sell detergent. Like he had nothing to do with whatever the freak show was on the panel. It was just there to say. And the fact that it was literally tight sponsoring this. But my issue is, if there is such a glorification of trans identity, my concern is a lot of these moms who are for them having a trans kids like winning the lottery. Cause right away their kid is more special than everybody else. They can make all sorts of demands. They can kind of be that Karen demanding the entire school run around them and their needs. And it gives them a sense of power. That to me is a big, big problem. Am I just, from in your opinion, is that something I'm just being completely misogynist about and delusional? No, this is absolutely the truth. And it's so clear to see a lot of these mothers, as far as these trans kids that have kind of been propelled into the media and are the faces of it, there's one on Time Magazine with Pink Hair a few years ago. There's documentaries made about these kids. The parents assume this role of like, they brand themselves as these activists. And I guess the argument can be made well if you have a trans kid, then you're gonna feel passionate about it similar to you would in the other kind of thing. But I think there's something inherently problematic about assuming that identity for yourself as a parent as well, because what happens is you're making it harder for the child to come to the realization that they made a mistake. And you have to leave that room. There's a documentary called Transhood on HBO Max. And there was this one kid who had all the signs of being trans, had the same signs as me, frankly, who were up wanting to play with Barbies and whatever. They went by a girl named, started judging like a girl at school. This went on for years from like aged like four to nine. The kid then said, actually I'm a boy, I don't wanna do this anymore. This was after years of the mother, you know, doing interviews, becoming a little bit of a public figure herself, branding herself on Instagram, having a documentary made. So it's like breaking the fourth wall there. And the mother didn't want to let the kid go back. The mother wanted the kid to remain a trans girl. And actually in the interview was talking about how deeply upsetting it was, whereas the dad was like excited, which of course, fathers need a more, they need to take on a bigger role in these kids' lives too. It's always the moms, I don't know why that is. Don't you think this, I started rough you, but don't you think this is basically the left wing version of being a Patrick mom? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. It's the same kind of dynamic socially. Absolutely. But it entails so much darker stuff. I mean, these kids, once they get to the age or they are medicalized, they can't come back from it. And then for what? So the mom could have a spotlight. And this isn't always the case. You know, there's a woman named Kim Petris. She's trans, she's like a trans pop star. She transitioned at a very young age. I've met her, she by all means seems like a happy, successful person, the traditional, or doubt, great. It's not the case what's happening with kids now anymore. And it's really bad, it's really, really scary, because I think it's gonna come down on trans adults eventually, like I said. What sorts of reactions have you gotten, when you decided to come out as trans to your friends and family? Oh, I don't think I had one friend, say anything negative. Half my family disowned me, the other half I'm still cool with, my mom's side, my dad's side disowned me. They really struggle with that. They're very deeply conservative. They're not even Christian, but they're very deeply conservative and they just do not get it. They're older, which is fine. That's something you have to kind of accept. But that's the problem, right? Or that's the issue, is that people are going so hard in the acceptance and the support to sort of make up for decades of like complete ostracization, families disowning these people. But the problem is you're leaning into glorification of something that has so many pitfalls, because human beings just have this thing about them, where they're not able to either like, they're not able to just look at it like this is an issue and we have to look at it seriously. It has to be we either love trans people or we fucking hate that. And that's why people have a hard time understanding why I exist in the right-wing sphere and why I've had that be my career for past six years. But it's like, I don't know, I'd rather win over white-wingers who were much more likely to be like, okay, she's fine, it's a trans person, whatever, than like the lefties who are supporting 12-year-olds having their breasts cut off. Like it, this is not a question of like the lesser of two evils for me, it's just clear as day to see. Okay, here's another one. Your dude referring to you as she is a lie. And by doing that, it's basically the slippery slope to causing kids to get unnecessary surgeries and be pumpable hormones. How is that? It's so dramatic, you know, I feel like do people go around and going up to, you know, kids that are adopted and being, it's a lie to call that your mom, she in birth you, that's a lie to call that your dad, he didn't give birth to you. Like, I think it's a bit dramatic. I mean, you know this, we hang out all the time, you've never seen anyone call me he ever. You've never seen anyone in your opera, in your opera me in that way because it doesn't actually be a mess. Well, you do because you're crazy, but also because you're allowed to do that because we're close, but the reality is, it's more of a lie if you think about it to like sit across to me and be like, I have to say heat. And that's why the right wingers that try to do it. This is why a lot of them ignore me, by the way, and try to like exist because they don't want to get caught up in using pronouns. But the ones that have had me on their shows, there are some of them that like really flip off on it. Like even like the Candace Owens debate where she's like full of hatred for me in a way that no one ever has been, right? And we're in this heated combative moment. Like one of the biggest memes to come out of that was that she couldn't actually keep the pronoun straight. Like she tried her best to call me heat. She really tried, but she kept saying she. It was just to interrupt the clap. Got some context. So Blair's referring to is what year was this? 20, so we're seeing. I don't remember. In 2017, both Blair and Candace were kind of went behind the ears starting their career versus commentators. Candace was still referring to herself as Red Pill Black. I think it was her handle on Twitter. Blair was this new young, right of center trans woman. They had a debate on the root report. It was one of the biggest train wrecks in YouTube history. I highly encourage everyone to go and watch it. Our buddy, Raka Raka Ali, he made a little video about it set to music called guys, guys, guys. And basically within five minutes, I think it was. I think you said it. I think Candace sits down and says, just declare for, I don't want people thinking this is a cat fight. This is a grown man I'm sitting across from. And it was all downhill from there. I was so gagged because no one's ever done that to me. But the reality to the point we were just making is like if she really felt that way, strongly enough to make that the center stage of this interview that we're both doing a hig or the survey or whatever, then she probably should have been able to do that the whole time. I'm not put flopping on the issue with mid interview. I'll maybe change my name over time. But mid interview, you don't go to this is a man to she, to he, to she, to she. That's where she kept switching. She kept saying she. And that was one of the things that people dragged her for the most was like, you made this whole thing about calling her a man. And then throughout the whole interview, you're saying she, 65% of the time. So that's the point. So I understand that people, when they do the whole like, I can't call any trans person he or she doesn't matter how well they pass or whatever, I understand people who have that position for the simple sake of the reacting to sort of all the people that use this issue of pronouns to control them. They use that language to control them. They use the they, them's and the zeezers. And it is literally just a political thing. But sitting down at, you know, and this is what I got Ben Shapiro to admit to you when I did my debate with him on my channel, which was also so long ago. Oh my God. There was so many lives. But he even said, but yeah, I would never say he, if I was like in a social setting with you, it wouldn't actually make sense. So is it alive? It makes sense to do like, I don't know, maybe it is, but are all lives bad? You again, you don't correct yourself in calling someone's adopted mother, their mother, because they're not technically their biological mother. Well, I think the bigger another argument for that, first of all, you're not pretending you're not biologically male. So it's not a lie in the sense that there's no, that you're trying to get over. But the other argument, and this is something that applies to everyone, is ghost writers. So someone will have, you know, Matthew McConaughey on their show, or Megan Callie, or Bill O'Reilly, or anyone, as the author of the book, they didn't write the book. And the host knows that the person didn't write the book. These books are all ghost written. I think it's literally over 99%. I can name the ones who aren't. Joan Collins, I know, did her own Belinda Carlisle, but like, literally any other book, and this is just how people can look it up themselves. You go to acknowledgments, it'll say, I want to thank, you know, Jeff Smith, who helped me so much preparing this manuscript. Jeff Smith is the one who wrote the book. Trump is open about having had a ghost writer for Art of the Deal. The guy came out against him. Hillary's ghost writers are known. If you're a celebrity, you're not even going to have a time where the technical skill to write a book, yet everyone feels comfortable pretending that this person is an author. Now, the reason why they feel more comfortable with that is it doesn't involve children. And it doesn't involve me having to change my life or accommodate this, you know, it's not really the issue. This is being something that's so pushed, especially at the corporate level, that I think people feel the need. And I can understand why to dig in their heels, be like, OK, I've got to draw the line somewhere because at a certain point you're just going to be out of polite society just because I'm not buying to your latest book. Oh, I understand, totally. And you look at the trajectory of, you know, activism within the LGBT world in general over the past decade. And it's so crazy to think that we ever even were debating about cakes. You know what I mean? It's like now you're at like drag queen story hour where the drag queen is literally a convicted pedophile who are reading the kids and the left is just silent about it. You have, you know, Leah Thomas, the trans athlete. But this is why I feel like it is so important for people to understand that there are actually... I can't tell you how many times we've had situations at the stadium where... What? All right. So you see it. I'm putting my job in the community. Brett. Yes, I'm here. You, you, you're, we can hear you. Sorry about that. I think you should keep it in. Definitely. I was watching it. You were... I feel like I'm back against digital. Blair, you were saying, I'm sorry about little Thomas and people digging in their heels. Okay. This... Yes, I understand the digging in of the heels because I dig my own heels in. Like, you don't think when I see Leah Thomas's big ass, like, just so brazenly, like hurting my man that I want to be like, this is a whole fucking man. Like, I do. And sometimes I might even do that. But at the end of the day, I think it's important for people to understand, like I said, on the right that have the this, this misconception that trans people are not an invention of the left. They are being co-opted by the left. They're absolutely the lead. How much is of the world? There are the Jessica. You need of the world. There are the people that are doing real harm under the guys of trans. But that's why one of the main things that I really push in all of my content and everything I do is telling people within the trans community, like, please just speak out against it because it's not that hard. It's not that hard to draw the line at 12 years. I know tits cut off. It's not that hard to draw the line at big, assily, autonomous, destroying women's sports. These are very simple corrections to make. But the unfortunate thing is every hill politically for the left is a hill to die on. There's no compromise at all. And so you have this train that's just going so far. And it's not even just with the trans stuff. It's like now you have, you know, pedophilia being like made into its own sexual orientation. They have a flag. They have a politically correct term. They're professors getting caught teaching this stuff. Or at least talking about this stuff all the time now because there's no breaks on the train. And the tactic by the proper press is to gaslight you into thinking that it's not actually happening. So one of the things that I've been pretty out to putting against the drag queen performances for kids recently is something you and I have talked about because you're a fan of drag race and all that and you agree it's not for kids either. But I tell people so I get asked this a lot how I can like I love transgressive art. I'm using it on the very loose sense. I'm not talking about Picasso or Michelangelo here. I just mean performance something. It's not provoking drag queens are about historically about upsetting people. But and because it is only a man in a dress in 2022 who can get away with wearing a swastika like Sharon needles does performing in blackface like RuPaul does dressing like Jean Bonet Ramsey like milk does. And there was a drag queen who got in trouble because there was some kind of talent show and she performed as a suicide bomber with a hijab and a vesfil dye might. That's the kind of thing where it gets people to freak out that I appreciate because they're pushing the envelope. None of that is for kids. This is late at night for people who are high or drunk who are like really really edgy humor and to have it be disnified and put for like young moms to me is as crazy as having a Chippenails dancer, you know, with his little bow tie and pecs having a kid in his lap or a stripper. No one's going to say stripper shouldn't exist. People are they don't respect them particularly, but they're not like, OK, you want to go but bring that into the classroom with the library. Even though that's standard, you know, heterosexuality. It's what is one thing I do with the other. It's literally like day. This is nighttime stuff, not daytime stuff. 100% and the and but what happens is I know this is someone who you know, I've been tweeting about this. I did a video about this and I've gotten a lot of like attention from the people who defend this. So they found it and they're coming at me. And what they say is, well, why are you saying drag is sexual? And then they'll respond with pictures of like drag queens that are not at all sexual like because they're they don't always present sexually and not every drag performance is sexual. However, there are sexual undertones all the time. This is still a man with his balls tucked inside his body. But this is still, you know, the humor that's employed at drag shows is often very, very crude. You can't go to a drag show without a mention of a penis. You can't, whether it's a joke, whether it's a story, whether it's an object, anything. So what they do until they can't do it anymore is gaslight into gaslight you and tell you that it's not happening. They will have you believing that you are crazy for thinking there's a problem with it. It is happening at these kids really are going to it. But the reason why these white liberal moms are so obsessed with it, because it does one thing for them. If nothing else, it communicates, I am not at all conservative. It communicates, I am on this side. It communicates, I am not on the rights. And that's what they want to do. But unfortunately, they're using that kids to do it, which I don't know. If there was some massive example of this on the right, I would criticize that as well. I don't like kids being used in politics. And I guess maybe now that I'm thinking about it, something kind of comparable would be like a lot of people on the right will like take pictures with their little kids, like four or five year old holding guns and stuff. But and I can see why that would be distasteful. People on the left, I could see why that would enrage them. But but still, I don't think that's particularly scarring in the same way that having like, I don't know, like a drag queen thrusting in front of you in underwear is. Let's get back to the show. Yeah, let's let's talk about gaslighting. Here's the other criticism. You're just mentally ill, right? And for and for people to sit and validate your mental illness, doesn't help anyone, doesn't help you. It helps society. And it's just making more and more people, you know, go down the rabbit hole of normalizing mental illness. I'm absolutely mentally ill. I think that being trans is 100% a mental illness. I don't think that that means that you'll have to be excluded from society because of that. I think it's a mental illness that does not entail like violence or harming someone else. I mean, we're not pushing out people that are autistic or people that have severe social anxiety. And you're not like yelling in a person with severe social anxiety space that they're, you know, a weakling and like shouldn't be allowed to be out because they're embarrassing everyone because you're so anxious. It's like, it literally comes down to is this person harming someone else or are they not? And I don't think that just existing as me is harming anyone. If anything, I mean, we can take me out of it and just the average trans person. But for me, it's like I'm pushing back on the same shit. So who am I really harming? I don't know. I think it's also much more powerful to push back on this shit coming from a trans person, you know, not for nothing like. Calm down. So it's your hysterical little bit of you as an example here. So you are incredibly accomplished. You have it to go to the audience. You have swayed people on a lot of things. You communicate these topics you care about in a way that moves people. I don't think you could move people on the trans or the LGBT issue in remotely the same way that I could or with the same amount of effectiveness. So, I mean, they can pretend as if they're going to make any headway fighting against this without actual LGBT people's help. But I think that, you know, a lot of the LGBT people in the political space on the right are doing so much more than just the people who want to throw out the entire concept of trans or being gay or being bi or whatever. You think of Ariel Scorssella. You think of me, Buck Angel, Caitlyn Jenner on Fox News. People love to hate her, but I mean, she kind of single handedly saw the trans athlete thing like they're making corrections, I think, based on the fact that Caitlyn was so outspoken, she was the most famous trans person in the world. So I think it's more effective coming from us. There was a was it a vice or HBO, I think, a special that you did was a big group of people was it which was a vice, right? Yeah. It was vice. But on HBO, on HBO produced by vice and it was there was a person there who I think they identified as either non binary gender fluid. I regard those terms as largely interchangeable. Although I'm sure there's there's people make some distinction between them. And it was basically someone who was clearly biologically male, but who had like some lipstick on and some like asymmetrical hair and a goatee and you flat out set you who were cast as the villain flat out set to them. You're not trans and the person couldn't handle it anymore. They literally, I think, clutched their chest and like, I can't even talk. Why did you feel comfortable saying that? And what did you mean by that? And what is your view about the difference between trans and non binary? Um, so why did I feel comfortable doing that? I guess I'm just kind of a bitch. I mean, they were absolutely right to cast to be as the villain. I'm used to it. This is what I do. Like when I do these like a group things, it's always like the one right of center person and then a fucking in this case, it was a group of like 10 lefties and I'm like, okay, well, then I kind of have to go hard. I can't sit here and be timid. I'm against 10 people. There's a few other people on the right there, but they weren't as outspoken as me. Um, so that situation was crazy because in true like vice fashion or whenever you're filming like a television show or anything with producers who are not in your favor. I don't know if they told people to do this to me, but the entire time people sitting around me were like saying things under their breath towards me and really frustrating me for about an hour. So there was a guy sitting next to me. Um, I forget his name. What's funny, just funny because it's just I, I, I, I, I doubt that they needed to be told because I think that type of person is just always champing it a bit to say something. They can't wait to get their two cents in, which you and I can relate to. Yeah. And you know me, you've seen me in certain situations where I like take a lot. And then like once I just can't take it anymore, I just fucking blow up. And that's kind of how it was. There was someone sitting next to me who was like, he was like whispering in my ear, like, you know, you're wrong for that, right? You know, that was really messed up. You'd say that, right? I can't move you did that. You're going to work so bad on here. And so eventually I just like, you know what? Let me just go off the non binary thing. Um, I think it's different quite literally in the sense that it's non binary where it's like being trans binary. Like I went from male to female, like that's one to the other. Um, and it's crazy how people can allow and understand all this nuance under the LGBT umbrella. So you have like pansexual, which is like functionally the same thing as bisexual. We'll just be really honest about that. But if you say that, you're going to get dragged. But if I say that being non binary is different than being trans, despite the fact that they are quite literally opposite suddenly on the bad person, but. I'm comfortable being the bad person. Like I see the way all these other trans influencers, you know, will be in my DMS agreeing with me on these issues and then publicly want to throw me under the bus or just join the herd because it goes what helps them get by. I'm not really interested in getting by. I'm interested in saying what I feel. Um, so it is what it is. So here's another criticism you get. And I'm excited to ask you about this because I don't think anyone has before. Do you denounce fully Nazism or are you basically a closet Nazi? I guess no one's asked me it because it's such a crazy question. Of course you get called to not say every five minutes, don't you? Well, of course I do. But I mean, that's kind of a course. Of course, of course, this trans one that's called a Nazi. Yeah, of course. Well, in this climate, it's of course, because if you're even slightly right of center, you're going to get called back. Do you be called out a lot or no? It's sometimes, but it's really funny because I was on the Jewish channel and I was wearing a blue shirt with a white blazer, which is the colors of Israel. And I had my hair in horns, like the Jewish stereotype. And the background is like Netanyahu, whatever, and the Israeli flag. So whenever they call me a Nazi, I just throw up that picture and they don't know what to do with it. But that's so funny. Yeah, I mean, actually they don't care. They'll just double down. They'll be like, there were some Jewish Nazis and I have this line. I've never used it, but in another context, I would if there was a civilised discussion to divorce anti-Nazis and for anti-Semitism is some a low key is low-key Holocaust denial. This was a central aspect of Naziism. This informed them very heavily. Super 10, you could separate the two is really anti-Gypsy and anti-gay. You know, they're they're a list, but pretend that it's just like being hateful as opposed to specifically targeting a population is just historical inaccuracy, but they don't care. That's a really, really good point. The the Nazis, it's crazy because people love to whenever I see people using that against me, they like to say, well, look at who her friends are. Michael, you know, I don't have friends. So these people think Yeah, but then so Nazis don't either. Not so one wants to be friends with us. Oh, no, they're not. They're not. But their friends are a bunch of other Nazis. OK. Yeah, so they think like we were friends with this and this person and I'm like, simply by virtue of being on the internet, right of center, I am friends with someone who's like so much further right than me. Even if I've like, I don't know, like been mentioned in a tweet with them or or whatever, it's like that means I am them. That's crazy. That doesn't mean that they are trans because they're not big with the trans person. That's just fucking nuts. So yeah, the idea that it's because of who my friends are. It's like my friends are like, I have like you and like one other person. Well, you're not very likable. Let's talk about just just briefly. You moved to Austin. Same day as I did, you moved from LA. I moved from New York. Austin is obviously a blue city, but it's a blue city. And by the way, people who say that Austin is like basically the San Francisco of Texas might be correct, but it no, it is the San Francisco of Texas, but it's not at all close to San Francisco culturally. That's just kind of completely nonsensical. What has been your experience like here in terms of, you know, being a trans woman as opposed to your experience like in Los Angeles? Oh, yeah, we've talked about this. I've never been. This is what's so crazy. So when I announce I'm moving to Texas, I did a video about it. The video went kind of viral and there was this big sort of like discussion about like, well, how could she feel comfortable moving to Texas as a trans person when Texas has all this anti-trans stuff going on, people that don't like her. And I'm like, first of all, I knew that was bullshit simply by virtue of like, I know I have a lot of fans in Texas. In fact, it's my biggest fan base in the country. And you know, as we get recognized all the time here, way more than that way. And I've never been treated more like just a regular girl than in Texas. There's literally no trans stuff here as far as like people making a distinction how they treat me. I mean, obviously people know whatever, but like in LA, it's actually the opposite. And LA, I was very much living this like trans lifestyle. Like I was where I'd be trans woman. Like that was my thing. I'm not how people saw me and treated me. Whereas here, I'm this a regular girl. So like men talk over me. Um, I don't know. Okay. It's a difference. Let's just ask this. What advice would you give toward parents having to navigate this stuff in public schools? And from what angle like the habit trans kid or they're meaning like they're, you know, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're a lot of parents who I would say are understandably concerned that their kids are being fed some of this dogma. I heard one story and I, one of my favorite things. Let's get this on a wholesome concept context is kid logic. I remember when I was a kid, you know, I was scared to go to sleep. So my parents would leave the light on the kitchen and I would worry because that would mean the electric bill would be through the roof, you know, because kid logic electricity is very expensive. And in my head, they left the light on all night, not realizing they turned it off as soon as I go to sleep. Right. So there was another story I heard, which makes perfect sense where this little kid got taught this in school and he came home worried that he's going to wake up tomorrow. He's going to be a girl, because in kid logic that that they're trying to make have it make sense in their own little brains. So I, you know, parents were concerned that kids are going to be told these things. They're not going to have the capacity to process it. Again, when you're a kid, you think a girl is someone who plays with other girls or maybe he plays with dolls and a boys, you know, whatever rough houses. So what would you tell those parents? My God, I mean, I feel like I have actually a bit of an extreme view on public schools. Like I actually think we could do away with it entirely. My mom works in a public school and it's actually quite a decent one. And the crap that she tells me that goes on in that school and just the level of like it's just insane. Can you give me one example? Yeah, so my mom deals with a lot of kids who come in and they're dealing with a lot of abuse at home and those kids go and they bully the crap out of other kids. And I don't like going to public school. I bought my whole life. And you do have and she told me as well that because she's in California that she's seeing all this stuff in the curriculum as well, the trans and on binary or whatever. And she's like, and she is kind of lived out like she is so crazy that I had a trans child and then I'm seeing this years later in the curriculum isn't this great. I'm like, do you watch my videos, mom? I don't think this is great. But my advice to answer your question is if you can homeschool your kids, I actually think you should or send them to a private school that you know isn't engaging in this. You've known some of them or so are. And then the second thing would be have just like a real conversation with them and tell them like, listen, this content that you're being fed in school is entirely political. And when you're older, you're going to understand that these things have agendas behind them. There's people that are dishonest about these things. But to also like raise them to respect people, like there's this misconception that you have to be teaching kids about all this crazy gender shit because it results in them not being hateful towards trans people later in life or gay people, lesbian people, whatever. I don't think those two things go hand in hand. I actually think it probably is going to be a bit of the opposite of fact. Anything I was like forced by as a child, like I was forced by religion, kind of at a young age, like I ended up rejecting it. So if anything, I think it's counterproductive to some of the kids faces. Just try to have a real talk with them and let them understand that it's political. And it's kind of like goes in and goes out like it's not always going to be like that. Yeah, there's a Yale professor, Jason Stanley or something like that. And he had this tweet and he was talking about how he was kind of shocked because what he's been seeing. I don't know if it was, you know, just colloquially or there's data. But his point was that what they're seeing is when people are being forced in corporations to take racial identity training or like racial sensitivity training and not the case case of like, hey, if someone has an axe. Senator, the weirdly pronounced name, you should make fun of them, which I think we could all wrap our heads around that person with an accent speaks two languages. You speak one and they're doesn't mean they're unintelligent. But as a result, this kind of idea that every white person is inherently racist and you have to stand up in front of the room and say I'm racist, even though you make it a point. To treat people, you know, equitably and fairly as a result of this, it's turning people to full blown like white nationalists and very much white identitarian because they're like, if you're forcing me to choose to think of myself in these terms, I'm going to choose my family for yours and it's not going to be hard choice. And it's this huge kind of backlash that's happening because in their heads, all of all human beings are infinitely malleable. And if you sit down and you train people a certain way, people are just going to follow orders. And the biggest result of that they should have learned from was the Trump election, where a lot of people thought Trump was an ass, but they were told for a year and a half. You cannot under any circumstances vote for this person. It's completely unacceptable. And they're like, hey, you know what, I'm an American. So I do what I want. And I'm just going to do this to give you a finger and that ended up happening and it's still happening now in other contexts. Right. But this also goes back to what I said at the top of this interview, which is the stats about LGBT acceptance to climate. If all this activism was for the better, you know, if it really resulted in more people being kinder to each other and it didn't involve like the kids getting followed into the medical decisions or whatever, I would probably be off for it if it was producing those results, but it's simply not. It's resulting in the opposite. And I get it. You know, I have a 16 year old nephew who's in high school and during 2020, instead of doing the Pledge of Allegiance for a while, they're making them kneel to be a BLM. No. Yes. So you're making these kids assume these political identities. Do you think that that's like something permanent? Do you think that they're going to be like, well, you know, in sixth grade, I have this shut down my throat. So I'm going to say this way as an adult, it's probably going to be the opposite, which in a way does work out for someone who votes on the other side, but it still does a lot of damage to these kids. Like, when my nephew told me that I was like, what are you? Are you joking? It's also so much worse in schools, by the way, than people really understand. I think, you know, lockdowns and COVID and virtual school let people in on that a little bit. But I think it's a lot worse when they're not there back in schools and have these teachers right in front of their faces because these teachers also hide a lot. I mean, it's crazy because I never imagined I'd be in a place where I'm like demonizing teachers or speaking, ill of teachers, but like, it's hard to not see what's happening and just feel like these teachers and these public schools, not all, but like hashtag about all, but like so many of them are just fucking trash and they're, and they're, and they're throwing up all this trash on these kids.
