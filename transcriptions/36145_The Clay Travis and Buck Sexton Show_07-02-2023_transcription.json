I love our friends at the Oxford Gold Group. Well, I decided it was time for me to investigate precious metals from Oxford Gold Group. You're now an owner of precious metals from Oxford Gold Group?

Tuesday I don't even know what day it is. This is a rough, this is a rough start Buck. It's Super Bowl week. I know I'm traveling out. Basically right as this show ends, I'll head out to Phoenix. And I've already got so many things that I've got planned out. I already have forgotten what day of the week it is. So it is Tuesday. I hope I didn't panic anybody else out there. Almost almost the flawless opening by remembering what day it was. It is also state of the Union day, which is going to see Joe Biden head up to Capitol Hill. And I'm curious whether we'll see. Remember last year state of the Union, if I remember correctly, ended with Joe Biden saying go get him, which everybody was like, what exactly was going on there. And we think and we think it may have been a message to Biden's handlers to go get him up on the day. Yes, they are speaking. But instead he read it thinking it was a part of his overall speech. So so many different moving parts here, but Buck, I wanted to hit you with this, which just came down from CBS. CBS not exactly renowned for being biased in favor of of anyone out there who is a Republican. Ask George W. Bush about that. But they asked several questions that to me make it really hard for Joe Biden to argue anything other than the state of our union is not very strong. But I'm going to hit you with these. This is as devastating of a numbers as I can remember seeing for a sitting president. Are your own our Biden's policies? This is the question from CBS. Are Biden's policies making your own families finances better or worse, better 18% worse 49% making political division? Remember Joe Biden ran on. I'll get everybody back together again. I'm going to be normal. I'm going to end this divisive era that we live in. Are Joe Biden's policies making political division better or worse, better 19% worse 50% and this one and I'm going to build on this one a little bit more. But because I know you'll love it given your focus on the border making a legal immigration better or worse, better 21%. Worse 51% and let me build on this immigration for you, Buck. They then broke it down by everybody's parties out there. Do you think the Biden administration should be tougher or easier on immigrants trying to cross at the border? Tuffer 54% easier 20% buck Democrats by 10 points think that Biden should be tougher at the border. Not surprisingly, the GOP 83 to 11 says tougher independent voters 53 to 23 tougher white 61 19 black 40 to 21 Hispanic 44 to 25. As bad as Joe Biden's policies are, he has managed to unite the entire country in believing that he is awful on many things, but that the worst single thing that Joe Biden is doing in his presidency right now is handling the border. I just thought even from CBS, these were pretty staggering numbers that came out today. And here we are watching as the preparations for the state of the Union address tonight, Clay, for this regime includes re erecting the big black fence around the grounds of the Capitol. Do you see this? They're actually doing this morning. Yeah, they're setting up the anti riot fencing around the Capitol because of the insurrection. They're really doing this. And as much as people of reasonable minds and emotional stability can see this and understand the pathetic theatrics that it is comprised of, I think unfortunately, you know, we look at all this data. We look at how people feel about the economy. And then we see them preparing for the siege of what's going on at the Capitol state of the Union address tonight, which is going to be boring. You and I will watch it. I do not recommend that everybody else. I'll tell everybody, don't waste your time watching the state of the Union address. Clay and I will watch it. And we will tell you whatever is interesting about it tomorrow. It is not worth your. I was going to say, watch football instead. But I guess there's only one game left in football because I know about that one. Yeah, Super Bowl is coming. You know who's playing? Do you remember the Kansas City Chiefs and another very good team. I've actually impressed. You got one of the two. The Eagles. Thank you. Fly Eagle fly. There. My beloved Eagles, the majestic bird, of course. So here we are. They're watching all this unfold with the Biden administration and it feels a bit like there must be either some plan or some reality that we're not necessarily taking note of because all these polls indicate a regime that is floundering. But we did not see a Democrat party that got its butt kicked like all the polls were showing in the midterm election. And so I'm also now I'm very I'm more skeptical of polls now than honestly I have ever been. I was skeptical after what happened in 2016, obviously, but that was a happy skepticism. Like, yeah, look at them. They're wrong this time around. It proved that people can get it wrong. The pollsters will get it wrong in both directions. That was one of the lessons learned. And it just feels to me like for all of the idiocy and the incompetence of the Biden administration and the hysteria they surround themselves with while they're pre I mean, they're rectoring anti riot fencing around the Capitol, you know, get a grip lives with a riots after the last election just calm down. But, you know, they're nefarious and they're ruthless and they're organized and they move as a collective. And so I just don't want us to underestimate them because yeah, Biden sucks at the job. Biden could very easily get reelected president of the United States of this country unless we make the case and have an agenda and do everything right. You know, I just that's where my head is with all this, right? Like, yeah, he's terrible. Yeah, the polls show it. Does that mean he's going to lose? Does that mean that they'll actually have to seed power to the other side? I just I feel like we need to be very sanguine about it. I feel like we have to make sure that we look at it for what it is not for what we wish it would be based upon the truth of the economy and the truth of the book. How much worse could the border be clay? Could it be worse? Honestly, no, I don't think it could be worse. And I mean, that's really this is effectively the start of Joe Biden's reelection campaign, the state of the union, right? Because he's going to make his case for 2023. There are already reports that he's going to call for instance for a billionaire's tax. There will be several things that he puts in the state of the union that he knows have absolutely no chance of passing because he wants that to be the message coming out for 2023 as we roll into 2024. And so I don't think there's any doubt at all barring a major health related setback that Democrats are all in on Joe Biden. And I think we talked about this some, but I'm surprised it hasn't gotten more attention. The fact that they remade the order of the primary season for 2024 so that South Carolina is first, which is Joe Biden's most reliable of all the locations. Remember, he did awful in Iowa. He did awful in New Hampshire. And so they've recast the DNC has the overall primaries for the Democrats to basically ensure that even if Joe Biden were to get a challenger, he would be able to snuff out that challenger very quickly. Now, maybe somebody still is going to run against him. I saw where Marianne Williamson, you remember her, the, the sort of new AG guru for lack of a better way to describe her. She ran a couple of years ago and it sounds like she may run again. We've talked about the idea of Eric Adams, but a lot of the legitimate big time contenders have dropped out of this race. And so it now looks like they basically cleared the decks for Joe Biden and barring a major health issue, Joe Biden is going to be the nominee in 2024. And so this is his beginning stage to make the case that he is the best to take us into the next four years. And because I think effectively, if Buck, you agree with this by and large, we're in a gridlock to era that chances of anything substantial coming out in 23 or 24 very low. Yeah. I think that that's where we are. You know, we're, we're in a political trench warfare and we're trying to fight over a hundred yards of territory. But unlike in trench warfare, whoever gets that hundred yards of territory gets to actually call the shots for four years, right? So it matters a whole lot, but the margins are very small. We're on a razor's edge for what will determine the political and with it the rest of the future of this country. I think that's very meaningful for us all to understand. So I'm hopeful that that the right will not only be effective in producing. I mean, what is our health care program? I mean, these are things. Do you hear anyone even talking about that right now, Clay? I can't remember the last time I heard a politician on the right, any Republican, any conservative, anybody speak meaningfully about health care in all the polling. That's one of the biggest concerns for people. Look, I'm glad that Kevin McCarthy is saying social security and Medicare cuts are off the table right now because anything other than that is just electoral suicide. Right. I mean, if you want to if you want to lose, start saying, let's let's just, you know, deal with Medicare right now. That's a terrible idea. But we are entering a presidential election cycle. I know it seems crazy because we just had our midterm election, but we had said this all along. And I just think that we need to see not only a program that is make well, rather that is putting America first for the Republican party that is conducive and is compelling, compelling rather to people in the middle, but also that we understand where the Democrats were able to. With a weak economy and with a stumbling, bumbling buffoon as the president to avoid a midterm wipeout. We have to be very steel-eyed about that as we look at all the polls and everything else because I think, do you agree with this? I think we're going into a kind of a meh economy right now. I don't see it. Who knows? Right. I mean, if you want predictions that are wrong to look back at most major economists, I think it's probably going to just be kind of okay. Yeah. But if it's just okay, then it turns into what does that last one or two percent decide when they're in the election side? What does that last one or two percent of the electorate think about when they're actually pulling the lever? Yeah. And I think you're right. I think it's going to be blah. But Joe Biden's going to go out and say, well, we've got 14 million new jobs or whatever the heck it is. Again, new jobs being defined mostly as people who already had the jobs that they weren't allowed to have because blue states were shut down. And, and, and so look, to me, the Democrat line is set. There's not going to be a lot of drama barring a health scare, in my opinion, from Joe Biden. They're going to run him. I think it's crazy, but they're going to run him the best option. All of the drama is going to come in the next year out of the Republican side of the equation because I believe whoever Republicans pick will beat Joe Biden. I really do in 2024. The question is by how much and to what degree are we all sitting up at, you know, 230 in the morning waiting to see what a few people in Scranton, Pennsylvania decided to do in the election? You know, I would like to. This is my book, Buck. I want to win a landslide. I don't, I want to be able at nine o'clock to, you know, start having drinks and not have to worry about whether the fire alarm is going to come on in Fulton County outside of Atlanta. And whether we're going to have ballots come pouring in at three a.m. that changed the outcome in Wisconsin. I want it to be outside the margin of error. But that's going to be the choice that Republicans have to make in 2023. Who is the guy or the girl who is going to beat Joe Biden? Because that's going to be the matchup on the Democrat side.

Well, we just heard the beats that some of you will know come from the German singer Nina with her 99 Luft Balunz. This is right here. What? That's what this is. Okay, I was not paying attention to the music we came back to. Yeah, it gets a lot faster. We should, I've got to come into like the... There we go. Okay, now I recognize it. There we go. 99 Luft Balunz. Okay, anyway, now that first part I didn't get. I had to get the beat picked up there. I've been bothering our team to play that ever since the balloon went up. So thank you team. I was like, where is my 99 balloons? Yeah, but the 99 balloons was too many, because we only needed one big balloon. So that song, by the way, is about balloons traversing from West Berlin to East Berlin, triggering defense systems that then lead to nuclear war and the annihilation of the planet. So I'm just going to say... Way happier sounding than I would have presumed for something that would be reflecting of that design. As the New York Times described it, a bunch of balloons floats over the border between West and East Germany, triggering defense systems and leading to a war that destroys the planet. That is what that song is actually about. So when you're in the bar and you're having that seventh shot of Cuervo and you're like, 99 balloons, you're yelling it. It's about the end of the world, just so everybody knows. Man. What a downer. I mean, everybody was in a good mood. You just brought them right back to the square. You sound like Biden doing the State of the Union. Yeah. No joke. That's like, you know, when you were a kid, do you ever hear people playing a ring around the rosy? Oh, yeah. I know that story. Yeah. People say it's from the Black Death. And that this is supposed to... They taught kids this and the idea was that it would, you know, award away the... Anyway, about as effective as triple masking outside alone. I'm gonna say, just the modern day mask. So, Karina Jean-Pierre, since I got to play the song that I've been wanting to play for this, Karina Jean-Pierre was on the view because when you are addressing an urgent matter of national security importance, play, where do you go? You go to the geniuses of the view, obviously. That's the first stop on the media tour. So, you can have, you know, Joy Behar way in on whether we should send a patchy to Ukraine, etc. Right? I'll send all the fanciest planes. I know. Joy Behar is the dumbest person on television daily. I don't know that she would be any worse analyzing information than Joe Biden is. Which is really kind of scary. But if Joy Behar was in the situation room, I don't know that she could be much worse than Biden is. I actually have a... Before we get to the view, I have a real question for you. Something really bad. China invades Taiwan. Yes. Okay. It's happening. The flotillers have mobilized. They're on their way. The first airstrikes have happened. It's on. And you only have a choice between Joe Biden answering that phone call on, you know, the red phone or Kamala Harris. Who do you prefer to answer that call if it were to happen, you know, in the next year? Kamala Harris. Not because I think that Kamala Harris is in any way should be in the position that she is in. But I think that given the fact that she is, I think, 58, I think she could synthesize information and competing arguments better than Joe Biden could. Which could lead to a better result. I think I was actually talking about this buck with my wife yesterday. Because we were talking about the balloon and her argument. I think it's a good one. She's like, I know Joe Biden is ostensibly the commander in chief. That is the military officials have to come speak to him and say, Mr. President, here's what... I don't think that they speak to him. And that he in any way is actually the commander in chief. So I think really the question here, Buck, is who is the military official? Who is the decider, right? What should happen is when we select a president, we are selecting the decider in chief. Whatever the toughest issues are in the world, they come to his desk. You've been in there for these briefings, Buck. You have a lot of smart people. This is true. Who have elevated themselves inside of the government. And they will make the case, we should choose option A, Mr. President. And they will give you all the reasons why option A should be selected. Then B and C. And they're all really good options. And the job of the president is to decide between several challenging options, the best. He's the decider in chief. That's what scares me the most about Biden. I think you're right about the Kamala choice between the two. I think maybe Biden 20 years ago, I would take over Kamala. But Biden now, I think Kamala is the right choice. Under that very, very frightening service. They're both the wrong choice. She's the best of two bad option of the two of them. If that phone call were to come along. And then also on the on those kinds of briefings and those moments, you know, one thing I will say, I'm very critical of the deep state and the apparatus and everything that goes on from the top level, whether it's FBI CIA, there are freakishly smart people who can sit there and just tell you everything that you would ever, ever want to know about every Soviet missile system devised in the last 50 years. Those people do exist in the CIA and the DIA. And you know, they're there. They're just not the ones that are, you know, going, going for big photo ops with the president. They're not the ones that are appearing on NBC. They're not the ones that are, you know, so just to be clear, there is that repository of knowledge that exists. But they're not involved in the political nonsense. And they're also not the ones who you'll be hearing about. The opposite of those super brilliant people that know a lot about a lot of things. And they just quietly do their work every day inside the intelligence community and inside the, you know, Pentagon and the military intelligence would be the view. The view does not bring a lot of knowledge, skill and wisdom to anything, certainly not to daytime television. Karina Jean-Pierre, though, this was interesting to me. She went on the view to talk to them about blocking U.S. transmissions from the ground to the balloon play to one of the things that we were able to do is to make sure none of the sensitive security information, national security information on the ground was transmitted. So we were able to block that. But at the same time, we're able to gather information form the balloon as it was traveling on its path. And then when the time allowed and it permitted the president, who was also the commander in chief, as we all know, and when the balloon got over water and as he had asked for the Pentagon to do, which is to take it down, they took it down. By the way, can we just say shoot it down? We shot it down. Yeah. We didn't take it down like, you know, like party streamers in the office birthday setup. Like we shot it down. Let's just use the real terminology. I think so. We just like gently glided it to the ground. But Clay, first of all, okay, so let's say we just take this at face value. They were the block the transmission back to China. Were they the block at the whole time? Are we to believe that they were just hovering there, blocking the trends? How long was that going? This went on for days, right? This thing doesn't move fast. And also the Chinese never, they didn't have some uplink that would send back the... I mean, if they thought a slow moving balloon was going to have to get back to Chinese airspace intact, this is the crappiest surveillance plane, you know, in history. I mean, you'd be better off with a hot air balloon back in the Civil War days, right? Yeah. So something's up. Well, not only that, what did China expect? We spend a lot of time talking about what we do, right? But a big part of this to me is figuring out what were China's motivations? I asked a question earlier, Buck, where did China launch this from? Did China, when they did their briefing on what the Chinese spy balloon was going to accomplish? Did they ever, in any part of their analysis, think this balloon's going to enter the United States airspace in Alaska and exit off the coast of South Carolina, and then the United States is going to shut it down? Like, what did they think? My expectation would have been, if I were China, the United States is going to shut this thing down over Alaska as soon as it significantly enters airspace, right? Like, I think the story of the Trump thing may be true, but I think they were kind of probing. Hey, do they notice if we go into Hawaiian airspace a little bit? Hey, do they notice if we go into Florida airspace a little bit? Do they have the NORAD defense mechanisms in place to recognize where this balloon is? I think that was their test. I don't think they ever expected that it would go all the way across the entire continental United States. And so I suspect that they adjusted the game plan. Like, they're like, okay, well, we're in Montana. Why don't we go over this Montana airfield? And then we're going to drift down. I think they thought that this thing would get shot down. So if that's what they thought was going to happen, what is their analysis right now in China of what took place? To me, it looks like, oh, the United States defense mechanisms are not very strong. Biden does not have the political will to act aggressively in short order when given new information, which is why I think your question buck is such a good one. What is he going to do if he gets woken up at 3 a.m. in the middle of the night and they say China has begun its invasion of Taiwan? Everybody asked about this, by the way, claims that, or rather agrees that no one really knows what the U.S. would do. That this strategic ambiguity is really a, we're not sure what we would do. We think we have strategic ambiguity with regard to Taiwan so that we keep China on its toes, so we don't give away the game. But actually, we don't know. That's the truth. We don't know what we would do. And, Buck, here's the other question. What are Biden's top advisors going to suggest to him to do? Because if my wife's right and basically Biden is commander in chief and name only, then whomever those top military advisors are, whatever their recommendation is, is what Biden is going to do. So don't worry. That's a lot of power. Secretary of defense of the future of Buddha Judge will be handling it just like he's handled the transportation situation in this country. So it'll all be fine, folks. You know, Clay and I really do love learning. We consume data and information constantly and we love sharing what we learn.

There's a battle of Bruhaha going on right now out in the state of Oklahoma over trans treatments for young children. The governor of Oklahoma, Kevin Stitt joins us now. Governor, appreciate the time. I know you're in the middle of a battle out there. What is so controversial? You walk me through this. You can't get a tattoo most places till you're 18. You can't drink a beer till you're 21. You can't rent a car till you're 25. Why is it controversial to say, especially for minor kids, that they can't have gender reassignment surgery? What's this battleground like, and why is it even a battleground at all? Well, first off, pretty common sense to us. We don't think it should be controversial. We're really just trying to protect kids. We're not trying to go against any person. But we do not believe, like you said, that a minor that can't buy alcohol, can't buy cigarettes, can't get a tattoo, should go in and have a permanent gender altering surgery. It just makes no sense at all. So I've called the legislature to ban that. You've got some folks that are, I don't know, you'll have to have them on there. Why they think that's a good idea to do this to minors. But you have a few protesters coming out, but overwhelmingly, Oklahomans support this. And we're going to get it across the finish line. Governor state, it's Buck. Thanks for being with us. It seems that there's a number of bills at bill 129, the Milstone Act. And that would have a ban on gender reassignment for those under 26. I'm just wondering, is it already clear which one of these bills is the one that will get through the legislature? Basically, which one are you going to sign? Yeah, well first off, I'm going to sign whichever one goes to my desk. But I'm working with the leadership of the House, the Senate. We think the cleanest way is just say 18 years old. There's a thought to go to 21, but it's very clear that anybody under the age of 18, we need to protect those young people. And listen, these are elective surgeries. We don't want tax dollars to go to these types of surgeries. If you want to do this and it's elective surgery after you're an adult, that's one thing. But again, we have a responsibility to protect our young people, protect our children, and we're going to do it. I mean, this is the only type of a surgery that somebody can come into a doctor, self-diagnose themselves, and also prescribe the surgery that they want. And we just think that type of surgery should be left to an adult after your brain is fully developed. And there's all kinds of studies that kind of back that up. That kids, you're not able to make that decision at that point. So let's just wait until you're home. Governor, in your state and Oklahoma, what is the current procedure? Is there one for, you know, because this law obviously would address this, but prior to this law or previous to this law's signature and going into effect, was there some baseline number of visits? Is there some number of different professionals? Like basically for a minor to have transgender surgery as it exists right now in Oklahoma, is there any defined process or is it just up to the individual medical practitioner? Well, that was the case. There was actually a clinic that we discovered in one of our big university hospitals that were performing these type of surgeries. And so they were, you know, basically promoting it or people that were coming in, and they could do these permanent altering surgeries there. And so I did an executive order last year to stop that from taxpayer dollars being used, and then I asked the legislature to codify that into law this year. But not a ton had been done. So again, this is a very, very small minority of folks. And again, we're not against any one person, and we believe in freedoms and personal responsibilities, but we have a duty to protect young people. And that's what we're talking about here. We're talking about kids that are under the age of 18, and that's what I'm calling for in legislation this year in Oklahoma. Where has this come from, Kevin? I mean, you're a governor, but let's just step it back. Like you're also a dad. I'm a dad. We've got young kids. You're around my age. You grew up. Like there were people who were tomboys, right? Like seven, eight year old girls. I've coached literally baseball. We've got girls playing on the teams. This idea that you should be treating kids who suddenly say at eight years old, like, I'm in the wrong body, we're going to delay puberty. We're going to take, I mean, literally take off some of their organs in an effort to make them a different gender. This is all way more substantial than where the transgender universe began, which as you mentioned is, hey, I'm an adult and I decided as an adult to make these choices. Where is this drug force of child treatment coming from? And are you a stun to see it sweep the country as both Buck and I have been and many of our listeners are as well? I mean, listen, I mean, people that are coming out of the woodwork, the left just continues to move further and further away from mainstream and what is normal and reasonable and righteous. And so again, I can't tell you where it's coming from, but what I can tell you that people are starving, the most people around in America that we talk to, they're starving for people to talk about traditional family values. They're starving for people to talk about putting focus back on the family. And again, this isn't against any one person, but to us, it's just common sense that we're going to protect our young people in the state of Oklahoma. We don't think that should be controversial. But again, you're going to have a few people complain, you know, if your ice cream is too cold. So you've always got these fringe folks that are going to come complain about something. And so we really, we're going to move forward with this. It's the right thing to do. And Oklahoma, for one, when they support me, I think most Americans think that we need to protect minors as well. We're speaking to Governor Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma. Governor, there was that protest that made its way inside the Capitol. Were there, were there any arrests? And I'm just wondering if your expectations are that these kinds of protests in and around the Capitol are likely to continue. You know, there were no arrests. And for the most part, I mean, they screamed and hollered a little bit, but they had a permit to protest on the second floor. They moved up to the fourth floor. So when I was going out to deliver my state of the state address, you know, they were screaming some profanities at me. But anyway, no big deal. It wasn't like they tore anything up or broke into the Capitol or anything like that. But our police had it all under control. And I mean, in Oklahoma, we're going to arrest you if you get out of control in Oklahoma. So they immediately said, hey, you're going, we're arresting you. They only had permission to be on the second floor if they didn't quiet down. So everybody immediately started quieting down. But we had a great show of force and we had our, you know, our great highway patrol. We're all over that situation and nothing. There was never any danger for the citizens of the state of Oklahoma or the Capitol. We're talking to governor of Oklahoma, Kevin Stitt, Kevin shifting gears off of the transgender issue. We just had a Chinese spy balloon float all over the entirety of the United States. Now I don't believe it came through Oklahoma airspace. One of the things Buck and I, if it was in Oklahoma. So I mean, so that's, that's my, that's my, honestly, that's my question for you. I said, if I had been the governor of Tennessee and I think it kind of skirted Tennessee and, you know, it went out South Carolina, North Carolina, whatever. Okay. Let's say that you are the governor of Oklahoma. And let's say that another Chinese spy balloon comes into the United States again, which, given what happened once, I mean, why would we not think they might do it again? Can you as the governor of Oklahoma shoot this thing down? I mean, I, I, did you ask your, your team? Like, we haven't ever really, to my knowledge, had a situation like this. It's without precedent. But the argument that I made on the radio show is if it's in a state airspace and if the governor wants to call out the state guard or someone that he's in charge of, could you shoot down that spy plane? That spy balloon, would you have done it? I mean, what should happen there? What should a governor do? Well, first off, uh, you know, I, I say that tongue and cheek a little bit. But, but absolutely this was so frustrating for, I know my Republican governor colleagues around the country, when we first saw that coming, we got on the phone, we got briefed by the DOD in the White House on this issue and why it wasn't ever shot down before it made into the U.S. airspace, uh, is a head scratcher. And I did call my national guard. I called my commander. I'm the commander in chief of the Oklahoma National Guard. And so, um, I was talking to him if it did make it down here, what we've got, we've got an F-15, F-16s in our, in our, uh, at our Tulsa National Guard. And so, we have those conversations. Obviously, that's a bigger conversation that we would need to have with the Department of Defense. But like every American, uh, you know, and my job is to protect the citizens of Oklahoma with our national guard. So, but that's a huge, huge issue that we obviously would be in consultation with the, uh, with the big army. Uh, but I guess the real question we need to ask ourselves is how do we let it, let it get into the airspace? Amen. And that's the really the question that needs to be answered. And, and if the, if the Pentagon did not brief the president, which I'm heard they didn't, um, I think heads need to roll there as well. Pentagon didn't brief Trump or didn't brief Biden on this. Didn't brief Biden. Uh, if they didn't. Oh, wow. Biden, until it was in, uh, until it was already inside the U.S. airspace. And that's a big problem. Uh, but yes, the president needed to make decisions before that thing came all across our continental United States. And Governor Stibb, what do you make of the reports that, oh, there were a bunch of balloons under Trump too, but no one told Trump something like that. I don't believe that at all. I mean, I know president Trump and there's no possible way he would have left that happen. And so we, we did not believe that there were spy balloons here in the continental U.S. Uh, under, under Trump. All right, much less serious, but I saw that Americans are going to wager. I don't know if you've seen this, uh, story. Americans are going to wager more money on the Super Bowl than Iran spends every year on its entire defense department. So we got the Kansas city chiefs in the Philadelphia Eagles. I know you're a big sports fan. Who's going to win? Why? Man, I'm going to go with, uh, I'm going to go with the chief, uh, my homes. Uh, I really like my homes. Now, now Hertz has a little connection to Oklahoma. He called about the University of Oklahoma. So a little bit of Oklahoma state cowboy. So I don't know if you want to back. I know you got. I have an Oklahoma state cowboy, but you know, when, when, when a local boy does well, you want to, you want to root for him too. But my homes, I watched him play when he was at Texas Tech and, and as a big 12 guy, uh, he's just been amazing. Good stuff, governor. Well, we appreciate your, what you're, the fight you're fighting out there over this, uh, what seems like quite simple, uh, child abuse bill to try to protect kids out there. And, uh, hopefully if the Chinese spy, uh, balloon comes through the state of Oklahoma, you can take it out and come on and talk about it with us. Well, that'd be pretty cool. Well, listen, keep talking truth out there. Uh, Americans love you guys. So keep it going. Thank you so much, governor. Okay. Thank you. Bye bye. He's great. Um, and, uh, in fact, like we said, that this could ever have been controversial. Hey, you can't have surgery on minors to change their gender. I mean, I, I just, I wonder how we ever got here, right? How about you and me on Friday and all of our listeners, when the balloons flying over our airspace were like, shoot it down. Yeah. I mean, immediately. And they were all the lips were, oh, it would cause an international conflagration. And then a couple of days later, Biden shoots it down. Okay. Good talk. Except she shoots it down over water and they're having difficulty salvaging all the pieces because it's over water. It's there. Uh, look, everybody's got a great family memories.

I hope all of you are having a fantastic Tuesday wherever you may be. We are bringing in now our friend Gordon G. Chang, who does an incredible job analyzing the situation of geopolitical struggle between the United States and China. His latest book is the coming collapse of China. Sorry, his latest book is the great US-China Tech War at Gordon G. Chang on Twitter. So Gordon, when you saw this story about the Chinese spy balloon, your thoughts in terms of analyzing why it happened, that is the motive on China's side was what and where do we go from here? Yeah, there were two things which I thought were possible explanations. One of them was that Xi Jinping was so bold, so aggressive that he was going to try to humiliate the United States, tell the world that the US was done as a power and that therefore they should ditch us and obey China. The second thing is that the Chinese military, which we know is politically powerful, basically decided it was going to do whatever it wanted to do and they were then going to fly this right across our Air Force bases, which had bombers, which had ICBMs and the rest of it. I don't know which of those two is correct, but neither of them is a good story because they say that China is preparing to go to war and unless something changes, that's probably where we're going to end up. I mean, we can deter China, but we're not deterring China now. Gordon, do you see parallels between what China is doing here and the Cold War with the US and the Soviets, U2 flights and other spying and surveillance missions? We had the U2 incident in what 1960, where Francis Kerry Powers, the U2 pilot, was shot down. This is a little bit different because it could very well mean that in China, this is a regime in turmoil. Right now, I think Xi Jinping sees a closing window of opportunity to achieve what he considers to be historic goals. So he's going to roll the dice and do it while he can. And if the second explanation is right about the military freelancing, then we've got a different set of problems, but one which are equally difficult for us to deal with. So in that sense, the Cold War had a stability to it. Right now, I don't think we have that stability. You think the timing with Secretary Blinken, I'm really intrigued by your analysis here, because if you are correct, and this was potentially a Chinese driven military move without necessarily Xi Jinping being involved in ordering this, then it could have been timed to try to embarrass him associated with the Anthony Blinken visit coming, right? In other words, they don't want there to be sort of a lessening of tensions potentially in China. Do you think how would you analyze the timing of the Blinken meeting given your potential scenarios there? Yeah, that's a great question. Some people have thought that the balloon incident was time to actually derail Secretary Blinken's anticipated trip of February 5 and 6. Different people said, no, they wanted Blinken to come, but they wanted to give Blinken a bargaining chip in a sense, basically saying, we'll stop the balloon flights if you stop the reconnaissance along our coast, which is an even more arrogant way of looking at the Chinese. Right now, I don't know what the correct intentions were and the motivating reasons, but we do know that there is trouble inside the regime and that it's poor tens, I think, increasing tension, especially because we have President Biden yesterday saying that this balloon incident is not going to weaken US-China relations. Really what Biden is saying is that the Chinese can do anything they want and we're still not going to impose costs. That is extremely troubling when you think about the psychology of this. That attitude that the Chinese can do whatever they want, that goes back to President George W. Bush who imposed no costs on China for the EP3 incident. So this is a clear pattern. You've got Republicans, Democrats, liberals, conservatives, they have all had attitudes which have emboldened the worst elements in the Chinese political system by not imposing costs for bad behavior. Gordon, so do you think this is the big question, right? You and I were debating it earlier. Do you think we had that military general come out and say 2025 is when he thinks this is going to happen in terms of China invading Taiwan? Do you think this just continues to port 10 China invading Taiwan? And if so, what is the Joe Biden? What is the United States response going to be? You're referring to General Mike Minahan, who is the chief of commander of the air mobility command of the air force. And that leaked memo said that his gut, his he put it, said that we'd be fighting quote in 2025. After this below, and everyone said, oh, that's really close. Well after this balloon incident, I think 2025 is a long way off. It could very well be before that. And it could be Taiwan, could be India, could be Japan or the Philippines. However, in December when China was going through those protests, China was very provocative with the large incursion into India's aeronautical Pradesh in the Himalayas. We had stepped up provocations in the South China Sea against the Philippines and in the East China Sea against Japan and of course the continuing air incursions against Taiwan, especially the one on Christmas Day. So as China gets weaker, it gets more belligerent. And as I think Xi Jinping sees, Biden is not going to stop him. So this is I think the most dangerous moment in history. Gordon, well, we're speaking the Gordon Chang, follow him on Twitter at Gordon G Chang and also get a copy of the great US China Tech War, which is his latest book. What would be you brought up no cost in response to this? And clearly flying a big balloon in US airspace for days on end, everybody knows that it's a surveillance or spying balloon. So they're trying to get information about US defense and military capabilities that we don't want them to have. What would be appropriate costs to make the Chinese incur in response to this? What is the path you think that would actually show the Chinese? You can't get away with this kind of stuff anymore. Yeah, I think that first of all, the costs have to be disproportionate. In other words, so much greater than what the Chinese did. And so what I would do is I'd break off all communication with China. I would close their four consulates in the US, strip their embassy staff just down to the ambassador. I'd start closing the Chinese banks, which are laundering fentanyl profits for those gangs, that fentanyl is killing Americans. This is a menu of things that we can do. But essentially, we have to show China that the costs are severe and that those are would be severe costs for a balloon incident. Just imagine what it would be for something else. There's a lot of things that China needs the US for. I don't think we should be providing them to the Chinese, so I'd like to see them all cut off. I know that sounds drastic, but I think it is strategically wrong, but even more important. It's morally wrong to build up the armed forces of an adversary that is planning to kill Americans. And that's exactly what's happening right now. And Gordon, I have to ask him, they've said that there were a number and it's tough to see what's true and what maybe the exaggeration is here from our own government. They said that there were balloons during the Trump administration, but maybe they didn't tell Trump about them. We had Trump's acting secretary of defense on. He said he had never heard anything about this. And the guy's secretary of defense, I feel like he could probably get a good read on what the military knows. But is it your belief then that if we don't have any kind of costs associated with this, it's China just going to keep flying these balloons. I mean, it doesn't feel like why wouldn't they? Yeah, why wouldn't they? And you know, you go back to George W. Bush, not imposing any costs for stripping our EP3. First of all, clipping the wing, forcing it down, imprisoning the crew, trying to hold it for ransom, stripping the plane of its electronic gear. No costs on China. So really what happened is George W. Bush told the worst elements in the Chinese political system, go right ahead and do this. And what it did was it said to the other elements of the Chinese political system, those that would want a cooperative relationship with us, we told the cooperative people you're wrong, because we don't impose costs on being belligerent. So this has opened the door. And if we don't change our attitudes towards this and our policies, this is only going to get worse. Now people, they say, you start cutting ties, it's going to be worse. But the point is, our policies, which sound good to the ear, have created a disastrous situation. Every option now going forward carries great risk. And that's the result of misguided policies over the course of especially the last three decades. So what choice do we have? We've got to try something new, because if we don't try something new, we probably are going to end up in the worst moment in history. Who do you think Gordon in this administration has China policy the most in their hands? Or is there responsibility? Is it really because it feels like Biden these days, they all know, you know, they're just trying to push him along. Is it blinking? Is it somebody on the DoD side? Who is Biden's top China person right now? Well, on the National Security Council, it is Kurt Campbell. But you have Blinken, you have Jake Sullivan, the National Security Advisor. I'm sure there's some people in the basement that we never hear about, the proverbial Obama people. And of course it's Biden himself. I mean, he, forget about Hunter Biden, forget about the money issues. Even if those aren't true, Biden has views about China that are seriously out of date. And his views are those that have created this situation in the first place. Add in Hunter, add in the money, it just gets even worse. So you know, I don't know who is making policy, but I can tell you it's a disaster. Gordon Chang, everybody follow him on Twitter and Gordon Chi Chang and pick up a copy of the great US China tech war. Gordon, thanks for being with us. Oh, well, thank you so much.
