Welcome to Fierlers for Jason Whitlock. Happy hump day. Oh, and it's a hump day and that means it's Wednesday. That means we got some harmony going on. Pastor Bobby and Pastor Anthony will be by and we will talk about, we'll follow up on my conversations we had earlier this week about Jim Jones and communism and the role of the government. From a biblical perspective, but before we do all that, we'll roll out to Chicago and bring in Greg Couch. He's written a column about the Olympics and the lack of heartwarming moments in the Olympics. I think he wasn't as moved as I was Uncle Jimmy yesterday. And by the way, you got some colors going on today. You jumped in a crayon box before you came. What was with you? You can't relate to the mustard man age man. Come on, you better get ready, man. You better get ready. Come on, man. Quite a distraction over here. I hope I can focus. You'd have to know how to coordinate. Yeah, that's what that is. Did you see this last night, Jimmy? Did you see what happened at the Olympics? There was a magical moment here at the Olympics. And the Americans with that dream of finally standing atop the podium at the Olympics. Tamara Menza's stock of the United States has won an Olympic gold medal. I spent, yeah, I spent most of last night and most of this morning trying to figure out what's so different about Tamara Menza's stock. Then everybody else at the Olympics. That's, she's the 28 year old black woman who won an Olympic gold medal last night in wrestling and then celebrated, Jimmy, you can relate to this. She celebrated like it was 1999. Remember 1999? Oh, yes, I remember Prince had the song. It was a song, you know, the artist formerly known as Prince. He used to sing about 1999. Back then, Bill Clinton was president. Cher had this unbelievable song called Believe That Was Number One. Ricky Martin, is that the one she had to thong? No, she did not have a thong. She was old by that time. But Ricky Martin had that song, Living La Vida Loca. 1999. You have that in your middle row of decks. You don't remember? I'm living in La Vida Loca. Why do you? Anyway, that was a long, that was two decades ago. Right. It was commonplace back then for black athletes, black Olympians to wrap themselves in the flag and celebrate their homeland. Now, we don't know what to expect from these guys. There's an expectation of some sort of anti-American protest. That's kind of what we've gotten used to. American shot put her Raven Saunders won the silver medal and crossed her arms in an X. What kind of forever? She said she did it for oppressed people across the world. Saunders said that she and other athletes had been plotting ways to protest for two weeks over a group track. You ever do that Jim? You ever get in a group track and plan ways to protest, plan ways? You probably do. Yeah, that's how I got fired from the Sheriff's Department. Exactly. It was his idea. The group track. Yeah, I can believe that. I don't think Tamara Minsa's stock was on that group texturing. She's quite different. After winning her gold medal, she was overcome by joy. She honored God and celebrated her country. Watch this. Because I knew I could do it when I first started wrestling. I felt that I could be an Olympic champ. So I kept going. I did it. Sam, right you did it. But right now my mom, my aunt, my twin sister, my little sister, my grandma, they are my little cousins. They are all in Florida right now. Watching at 6 a.m. Cheering me on to my husband woke up really early to watch me. So it means the world knowing that they are watching. And that's all the support I needed. In your wildest imaginations, did you think you would ever win an Olympic gold medal? Yes. 100% yes. I knew I could do it. I knew it would be hard. I prayed that I could do it. In my wildest dreams, I knew. It is not just that you are dominant. I mean you won these matches convincingly. Did you surprise yourself at all? Of course I surprised myself. This is why the grace of God I'm able to even move my feet. I just leave it in his hands. And I pray that all the practice, that the hell that my freaking coach has put me through, pays off. Every single time it does. And I get better and better. And it's so weird that there is no cap to the limit that I can do. And I'm excited to see what I have next. Last question for you. Is that American flag around your shoulders looks pretty good. How does that feel to represent your country like this? It feels amazing. I love representing the US. I freaking love living there. I love it. And I'm so happy I get to represent USA. I love it. Mmm. USA. That was the goodness. Her joy jumps through the television screen. You can feel her emotion and energy. Her authenticity exposes the robotic fraudulent of the protesters who plot their actions for weeks. What makes men's stock different from Colin Kaepernick, LeBron James, and so many other of the protesting athletes. Jim, the answer is obvious. It starts with her relationship with her father. Both of them. The one above and the one in the ground. Men's stock enthusiastically professes a relationship with God. She has not chosen the secular path of her peers. Her dad, the one here on Earth, was her biggest fan. He died in a car accident driving home from one of her high school wrestling meets. She broke down when a reporter asked her what her father would think of her gold medal performance. Look at this. Tamara, I know you lost your father in high school. How do you think he would be responding right now? Seeing you on top of the podium here coming out. He would have been the loudest one here. He would be so proud. He would be so happy. He's from Ghana too. He doesn't say this all out. He was like enemies of Nigeria. It's kind of poetic that I had the rest of Nigeria in the finals. He's from Ghana, so that was kind of cool. Jim, it's obvious the absence of your biological father or a bad relationship with him often has been the most important thing to do. It's not true for everyone, but it is true. Meant to Stock's dad immigrated to America from Ghana. He came here to change the American dream. He bought into this country and was rewarded for doing so. His children adopted his American spirit and values. Broken families break the spirit. Have and or have no relationship with their biological fathers. You shouldn't be surprised that their view of America is ruled by cynicism and bitterness. Despite their economic riches, life has been unfair to them. There's no amount of money that can replace the love of a father and mother. The lack of American pride is a byproduct of the breakdown of the nuclear family. Meant to Stock has modeled the behavior of her parents. She's created her own nuclear family. She's married to a wrestler from her college. She has an unwavering commitment to her immediate family. She said she's giving her Olympic prize money to her mom so her mom can start a food truck business. Meant to Stock's parents laid an incredible foundation of support for their kids. That foundation launched a daughter all the way to the Olympics. It was awesome to see Meant to Stock celebrate God, her dad, her mom and her country. It used to be commonplace for black athletes before we turned our backs on the family structure God prescribed. Jimmy, what man? That young woman is awesome. What she accomplished was awesome. The way she celebrated was awesome. We need more of that energy throughout America. And Jim, I'm just 75% of our kids growing up in single-parent homes. It undermines everything. It makes you cynical and bitter and that's why so much anti-American sentiment is being expressed throughout the country. It's not 75% of black kids, but I think the number now is like 30% for white kids and for Hispanic kids. It's in the 50s, the high 50% to Sentel. It's our breakdown of family that is undermining pride in this country. Let me say that I'm so glad that you didn't come and say something to me right after that clip. Because you would have saw me over here with tears coming down my face. You know, they say that Rio recognized Rio. That was Rio. What she was saying, her emotions and her joy. And that's what we need in our country. That's what we need. The joy was about her family, her sister, her twin sister, her family. She spent doing, you know the words you didn't hear her say? I, me, nothing. That's what it's about. That right there. That reminded me. Remember George Foreman? Yeah. In the flag. Remember Flo Joe? Taking off running around with the flag around there? That's what I remember about the Olympics. Not all this. Not all that mess. Jim, everything starts in my view from the family structure. And I don't, it'll sound like I'm beating up LeBron and Kaepernick. And I'm really not. I feel sorry for those guys. There was a hole punched in their heart at a very early age. Kaepernick, both the Kaepernick's parents said his mama gave him up for adoption. And I don't think he's ever met his daddy. That punches a hole in your heart. LeBron James. I don't think he ever knew his father or maybe he knows who he is now. But no relationship growing up punches a hole in your heart and creates a citizen and a bitterness. And it sounds like I'm beating up on him, but my parents divorced when I was four or five years old. Lucky for me, both of my parents stayed highly involved in my life. Lucky for me, my immediate family, we had a bond and a connection. And I feel like I come from a great foundation. But there is no better foundation than two parents in the home committed to their kids. And then if they do break up, two parents both still involved in their kids' lives. And so I look at, we're all sitting around angry. There's a lot of us, not only say all, but there's a lot of us sitting around angry like, man, look at these athletes. Look at these public figures. Look at the anti-American sentiment that seems to be growing in this country. And we're getting mad at those individuals. And we're not looking at the truth and the reality is like, these guys are victims. They're victims of the breakdown of the American family structure. They have hope because I'm just sorry, the facts of the facts. We're blessed to be born into this country and to have these freedoms and the opportunities we have. And the Olympics, if the athletes would go around and go talk to these athletes from other countries who all, all is a strong word, many of them would love to jump over to this country and have the opportunities they have. And so I was right there with you. The first time I saw this yesterday, I got emotional and was just like, wow, so needed that energy because it's so authentic like you and I both have said, it exposes the inauthenticity of a lot of the woman is putting up the X, that don't remotely feel real. The woman at the Olympic trials, the pulled her T-shirt over her head, said she was set up. That don't feel real. When LeBron James is tweeting out, oh, we're hunted every day, that don't feel real. That's a gimmick. That's a stick. That's stuff they're doing. What this woman did was real and it's not just because I agree with it. You could just feel it. You could sense it. Could I ask you a question real quick on LeBron James? Yeah. Does LeBron James tweet it out of congratulations to this lady? As Colin Kaepernick... I don't have to go look. I don't want to say no, but yeah. As Colin Kaepernick tweeted out, congratulations to this lady. Has Simone Biles tweet it out? Congratulations. Speaking of that, I think that on Twitter, I think a lot of America is still complimenting and congratulating Simone Biles for quitting instead of congratulating this woman for accomplishing what she's accomplished of never quitting and oh, the other thing. Her father died and she continued. You mean to tell me that she didn't turn and start smoking weed after her father died? Jim, you've made a hell of a point in terms of we've spent the past week celebrating Simone Biles for quitting. Everybody, oh, I can't wait to get Simone Biles on my show and let's hear more from Simone Biles. And look, Simone Biles plays or participates in one of the premier sports at the Olympics. Jim Nastix. Right. I get it. She's the face of the Olympics. She's done all these commercials. Women's wrestling, relatively new to the Olympics sport, but you're right. Anybody that saw this video and saw what it meant to this and let's go ahead and play the cards. The left loves to play. This is a black woman. And where is the celebration of her? Where's John Legend? There should be a song. Where's Alicia Keys? It's early. We'll see what they do. But you're right. I just looked on LeBron. Everybody's in support. Two athletes have reached out to her. Kurt Angle. Is that right? Yeah, a wrestler. The wrestling. And Dana White. Dana White. Okay. You know who Kurt Angle works for? WWE. Dana White. UFC. Other than that, you ain't heard that. You know what Kurt Angle and Dana White have in common? They white. Where's the black support? Honestly good. I asked what I'm asking. Where's the black support for this black woman who I'm going to expect? Now I'm going to have to go look. I need to know where's the chosen one. You know that dude that got chosen one? You know that dude that got hung up on the cross for all of our scenes for the NBA? Yeah. Where's he at? I mean he's the leader. Ain't he the leader? I want to know. Where's the LGBT YNQSDD? Where they at? Before I get too far out. I mean I'm just asking. Matter of fact, hey, I don't think your people on over there on that other network even covered this story. I could be wrong over there at WWE SPN. I don't think they covered it. I need to know where is the coverage. I'm glad I checked. What you got? I got, she's married to a white dude. Which, I'm just going to say, her base of support isn't coming from us. She does have her immediate family and all that other stuff. But I'm glad I checked because I was about to say something inaccurate and wrong. But here's this strong, committed, coming from a great family. Where's her support from us? That's what I'm asking. Where's the support from the media that you're giving her right now? You're coming out with your open story. Where's that at from everybody else? And I ain't just saying it because I'm sitting next to you. I'm asking you a serious question because I think it's a great freaking story. If that ain't what America's based on, tell me what the hell it is. Let me tell you something. When I was in the United States Marine Corps, when I graduated from Marine Corps, I heard the star-spangled banner all my life. Amen. Nothing changes the way you hear about the star-spangled banner when you stand in there in your Marine Corps blues after you'd have committed and come through a boot camp and you hear that song. I'm sorry, man. I understand what she's talking about. I'm going to get you. You just led me to one of my big positions or thoughts that I've had for a long time. The lack of a draft, conscriptive, has ruined America. We used to make people any up to be men go join the military service as a damn good chance. And that was you ending up in some investment in this country. And I think it's one of the biggest mistakes we've ever made. And I say that knowing that if I had gotten drafted, I would have been disappointed and I would have been upset. My father, my father used to tell me all the time, man, you need to join the military. That's the one. You need that discipline. You need that. It's one of the greatest. My father was a street guy. Getting drafted and going into the military, straightened him up, put him on the right path, opened his eyes. And again, my father lived through some really tough, difficult times in America, racial history. But he believed in this country. He believed in his opportunities to create some happiness and joy and space for himself to do things that he wanted in this country. And I look at these people right now that just want to run around and whoever the Raven Saunders is just wants in the Gwen Berry and all these. They haven't been through anything compared to my father now. And I know how, I'm just sorry, I've seen some racist acts in America. I've seen live through it, have seen it. I'm not dismissing it at all. America is not perfect. No one in America is perfect. There's some things I've done in my life that people could attribute to if they wanted to racism. It was really just me being stupid. And again, I think I told the story a couple weeks ago about me beating up some white dude at a bar my senior year at college. It wasn't racism, it was stupidity and alcohol. And so people do dumb things. And some of it is, I guess, based in race. And I guess I know based in race. But to denigrate this country, the way that we have, no way, no dice. Unless you can show me some place in the world that's doing it better than us. Not going there. And so I'm so thrilled and pleased that this woman expressed what many of us know, even the people out there faking and protesting and taking the knee. Because if Colin Kaepernick felt the way that he says he does or if LeBron James, they would move. They would move. I'm up out of here. I got my would move. Yeah. If I felt that way. I ain't staying nowhere, I ain't wanting. Everywhere, every time I go outside, I'm hunting. You haven't moved? That contradicts rule number one of self-survivor. It's... Hey, did... Can I tell you the biggest racist thing about this? I'm sorry. Can I just tell you the biggest racist thing going on about this? Biggest racist thing going on is she ain't got no support from no black athletes. That's racism at its highest. How are we as black athletes not supporting this athlete? Let's see what happens over the next 24 hours. You know, yesterday it was popular on social media, basically among conservative white people and a handful of the rest of us that got some comments. I didn't even want to go there. Because that's who's been complimenting her. Yeah, that's who's reaching out to her on Twitter, but I didn't even want to go there. That's a damn shame. Anyway, Jim, it's about that time again. Time for me to grab a bill bar. Hey, man, I built bar supplies getting low. I know. I know. But it's time for me to grab one. You've heard me talk about my love for the salted caramel, but today I'm going with cookies and cream. Hey, Cory, is that the cookies and cream right there? Oh, man, they got so many great flavors. Oins meant brownie, coconut, all low in calories, low in sugars and carbs. These protein bars shouldn't be this good, but they are built bars. Also, the new official partner of the US Olympic track and field team for this year's summer Olympic Games that are going on right now in Tokyo. Did you see this Sydney, Sydney, McLaughlin? Yeah. Yeah. Possibly the finest Olympian we've ever produced. I can say that. She gave me one. She gave me one. Okay, look, you could be possibly correct. She was shaming her. Oh, a show shaming her. Woman is beautiful. She's spectacular. You've got to be careful. Women don't like you saying that nowadays. She's gentle on the eyes. She's awesome. And she came back and once she beat another American for gold and silver. They were both great in how they celebrated winning as well. They thank God. Thank the USA. Said they was proud of the represent. I was glad to hear from both of them. I think the other woman's name is... And it's beginning to make me enjoy watching their living. The Lila Muhammad, I think, as her name came in second place, was incredible. All right, anyway, go to built.com and use the promo code FEARLIS to say 15% off your first order.

Greg Couch has written a column about the selfie games. That's his nickname for these Olympics. He's calling it the selfie games. Greg, come on in here and I want you... Before I'm going to show a video of Novak Djokovic making a fool of himself, but first, I want you to explain why you're calling this the selfie games. Well, I think the social media has performed a lobotomy on a lot of our young people and athletes in general because it's removed the part of the brain that has empathy. So I'm calling it selfie games as a play on words because self-absorption plus selfie, which is something on social media. So just put them together in selfie games. That's where that comes from. You said that there hadn't really been any heartwarming moments so far in this Olympics. And I want to... Here's the clip of Novak Djokovic. You don't consider this heartwarming. Take a look at this. What a point. Oh, Novak just threw his racket in the stands. Good thing there's no crowd there. Wow. Yeah. Yeah, there's Djokovic throwing his racket into the stands and then he quits on his doubles partner. You don't consider that heartwarming? It's self-obsessed. I mean, it's ridiculous. The throwing your racket is a temper tantrum. I can even live with that. That's bad enough, especially when you're the sport of tennis has been led by... The men's tennis has been led by Federer and Nadal for so long and there's such great, greatly behaved people. So when you have leaders of a sport, the rest of the sport follows those people. So now here comes Djokovic and he's going to be the new leader of the sport. So God knows where the sport is going to go. But I mean, I can live with that. But what you can't live with is him walking off on his mixed doubles bronze medal match just because he's angry and doesn't feel like playing anymore because his partner, Nina Stejanovic I think is her name. I mean, her dreams are shot now. You want to win Olympic medal? Too bad. It's all about me. I'm done. I don't really want to play anymore. So yeah, not exactly heartwarming. No. All right. So you and your column talk about Djokovic and Simone Biles who obviously Simone quit during the team competition and dropped out of a lot of the individual events and then came back and won the bronze medal. Great. Help us analyze who looks worse here. Djokovic or Simone Biles? Who had the worst temper tantrum, the worst moment at the selfie games? I mean, Djokovic had the worst moment because what he did is take his partner away from having a chance to play in the Olympics and to win a medal. At least with Biles, she stepped away from her team. They both walked away from their teammates because they don't understand what a team is. But at least Biles's teammates were able to go ahead and compete anyway. With the gymnastics, you had four athletes there. For each individual thing, they would compete three of the three they think were the best. So when Biles was out, at least the other three were able to compete and go for it. But it's roughly the same thing. I mean, these guys just, they don't think about the team. It looks ugly. They're the goat of their sport maybe. I mean, Djokovic is at least in the argument. And it's just sad. I mean, it's pathetic, really. You not even give one shred of thought, one second of thought to who your teammates are. You're supposed to be there fighting with these people, not just, well, it's about me and now I've lost, I'm not happy. So I'm out. I don't know who these other people are. I don't represent them. They don't represent me at all. Terrible. Great. We started out the show. Uncle Jimmy and I were the discussion. Basically focused on, we think the breakdown of the family is why the athletes are so different and so narcissistic and so anti-American. You've kind of made an argument in your column and you've mentioned in passing here that social media is driving a lot of the narcissism and selfishness. And I'm sure they both play a role, the breakdown of the family and social media. But what do you think is driving the selfishness, bad parenting or technology and social media? I think the technology and social media is more of a modern issue. And so we're seeing the modern results. I mean, bad parenting has been around for a long time, for generations. And the social media, it's been around for a while too now. But it's just such a daily part, a minute by minute part of the lives of these people. So they're looking in their phones and they're making friends. But these are friends that they've never even met before and they're trying to get likes. They're obsessed with their own photos and themselves and they're living in this sort of bubble and they never really connect with human beings. And there's an empathy missing there just because of it. So I mean, yeah, the parents have been terrible for decades. There have been plenty. We always have examples of terrible parents. And actually, they've even gotten probably worse since Tiger Woods' dad was teaching us that if you'd take your four-year-old and turn him into a professional, then he could actually go on and make hundreds of millions of dollars. And really, Venus and Serena Williams' dad, Richard Williams did the same thing. But I think the social media is the bigger issue right now. And that's why it's leading to a newer behavior. So yeah, but I agree with you about the breakdown of families. That's huge. Uncle Jimmy, that's your boy Greg Cauchy. You got anything you want to add? Hey, Greg, real quickly. You're a coach. You teach a lot of these young athletes. What is it that you tell your athletes, that you teach them to try to prepare them, to maybe hopefully avoid some of these ego things and some of these problems that happens with the media? Well, I mean, I tell them that the purpose of a team is to support the team. And so that's what they're here for, is to support the team not to be for themselves. And it's actually with a tennis team, you know, it's a little bit of a different thing because tennis is really an individual sport. And when you play team tennis in college, it's sort of a contrived thing to put them together as a team. So these kids, and tennis players in particular, they've grown up being taught to play for themselves and be on a court, learn how to deal with things yourself. And it's all about yourself in tennis. So, but I've taught them that, but the purpose of the team is to support the team. And then also, I try to have, to some extent, I try to mix up some of the different levels of players and have some, maybe some of my top players will help warm up or give some work with some of the lesser players. I mean, they're all good players at college players, but just sort of bond. And the only thing I do is I have the men and the women tennis teams practice together as one group. And I just try to promote the whole group idea instead of just, you know, six or 12 individuals. Thank you, Greg. Thank you. My guy. Jimmy, what? Simone Biles, I think in an interview with Mike Toreko, I think last night it was, she complained, part of her answer, when he was talking about the pressure she was feeling and how hard it was, she said that, yeah, it's really hard and it's harder because I'm a woman, because everyone wants to see us fail. And when I saw that someone sent it to me over social media, it showed me the clip. And I'm like, what America has she been living in? That she thinks America or people are rooting for women to fail? What is she? This country has been bending over backwards for 60 years or 50, a good 50. Title IX and the investment in women in athletics is through the roof. We've, the whole, the whole, the government, the country, the money has all been invested in trying to promote women's sports. And this woman thinks we're all sitting around hoping that she fails. Again, this goes back to like, what are we teaching these kids? Who's putting this BS bad information in their ears? They tried. Right? Jim, you're, you're not joking, but you're also right. In terms of that, that, you were just reminding me, and I almost went here today. Tucker Carlson last night did a monologue about China and the money they're investing in American media and how the New York Times took down a bunch of articles that basically China had paid for, and they took them off their website, tried to make them disappear, but they got busted, and then he walked through all the other different media, including Washington Post, getting money from China, and it was terrific monologue. I keep going back. People, we got to quit going for the rig job. It's like, oh, Tucker Carlson, he's racist. Oh, he's conservative. Don't listen to him. This dude is courageously exposing things that people need to hear, see, and understand. America is being bought right from, out from underneath us by China and other influences. I'm glad you mentioned that because it reminded me again, Tucker Carlson, terrific monologue last night. People should go back and watch it. All right. Go to youtube.com slash Jason Whitlock. Hit that subscribe and like button when we come back. Very briefly, you don't have to go very far. We're going to get into some harmony. Pastor Bobby, pastor Anthony here. We're going to talk about the role of government. I'm going to make a difficult perspective. All right. Welcome back. Welcome back to fearless with Jason Whitlock, a special Wednesday, Tennessee Harmony edition. We're joined again by pastors Bobby Harrington and Anthony Walker from renew.org. Guys, thank you so much for being here again. Appreciate it. Earlier this week, I went on a rant about Jim Jones and communism and because a congress woman out of California compared Donald Trump to Jim Jones and Jim Jones is from Indianapolis. Originally, I'm from Indianapolis. My family attended several of his church services. My grandmother was a big fan of Jim Jones. Jim Jones at one time wanted to be basically the Martin Luther King, the white Martin Luther King, or pretended to want to be that. But anyway, it led to a larger conversation about Christianity and government and what is a healthy form of government. But I wanted to start guys by just getting a biblical perspective for our viewers and listeners. How should Christians view communism? All right. Well, let me ask you this. Are you concerned about communism or Marxism? Well, but Marxism, the political theory is based on socialism first and communism. So you're going all the way like as if we were to implement communism here? Yes. The whole conversation for me is very personal because in the late 70s, as a young man, I was trying to decide what I was going to do. I was a political science major. And so I went to the Soviet Union. I went to Russia. I went to Moscow. And it was coming back from Moscow when I really concluded how terrible communism was that I made a decision to find out more about the Bible, which led me to end up becoming a disciple of Jesus. And now I'm in ministry. So this is super personal for me. Communism itself is built around Marxism. And Marxism is an alternative religion. Let's just be upfront. It's not just a philosophy. It's an alternative religion. And it has all the market. Up there, Bobby, why do you say that? I've heard of it as a political theory. You're the first pro. I've heard someone say it's really a religion. Yeah. The reason that I'm going to say this is there are versions of religion that do not directly refer to God, like Buddhism. There's forms of Buddhism where you don't believe in God. And a lot of times people make this mistake of thinking you've got to explicitly refer to God for it to be religious. And that's not true. If it's something that becomes an idol where you make it a God, you make it the way you look at life and you're passionate about it, and it forms your worldview so that everything that you see, think, strategize around is based on that philosophy, that becomes the God of your life. And what's happening right now in the United States is a lot of people on the left are making socialism their religion. And it's become the way they interpret life and it forms all the ways they think. And we're mistaken if we don't call it religious. And before I let you hop in, Anthony, I see it as Americans are making politics their religion and it's really not a left or right thing. I think I see people that identify themselves as Republican. That's their religion. I've seen people that identify themselves as Democrats. That's how they interpret the world. So I can see why you're saying what you're saying. I personally don't see it that way. I see it that what's happening is that there's a cultural warfare right now between a Marxist view of the world on the left, a religious Marxism on the left, and people trying to hold on to the judo-Christian belief system of the past, then many of them on the right are still devout Christians and they don't like what's happening. And the only way they think they can fight it is through Republican politics. My problem would be, and this is what I've said to people, conservative people I spoke to, spoken to is like, I'll see them write on their bios on Facebook, Twitter. First thing they'll list is I'm a Republican or I'm a, a hard Magga or I'm conservative. And I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, where's God at in this? Why is it Christ, Christianity, the first thing I list? So I see people all the time on both sides of it. Their first thoughts on everything are, as a conservative, how should I feel about this? As a liberal, how should I feel about this? And I just, the reason why we keep having these harmony discussions is I want people to say, as a Christian, how should I feel about this? Yeah. So I, I, I agree that there are people doing that. I told you a couple of weeks ago about the guy I had a conversation with and I said, bottom line, which is more important, Jesus or the US Constitution, and he hedged. And it's because a lot of people, they've merged the two in their minds and I agree that that's not right. Okay. So if you, if I would say to those people, if you immerse yourself in Christianity and let people know that's where your worldview is coming from, they might see and hear you different. I totally agree. One of the most important things right now for churches that are really committed to Jesus and scripture is to disentangle ourselves politically from identifying that with Republican party because as, again, this goes back to what we talked about a few weeks ago, neither part, Jesus doesn't come in the words of Tony Evans, Jesus doesn't come riding on a donkey or an elephant. He transcends both of them and is more important than both of them. That's why he's the king of kings and the Lord of Lords. Anthony, jump in here. That's the point where we agree that I think that when you get to Republican, you get to conservative, you get to liberal and you see that before you see Christ or that leads before you lead with Christ, all that will happen is the pendulum will keep swinging. You'll go to an extreme view, a Marxist view, you'll go to a socialist view, you'll go to a conservative only or mega only when Christ needs to be elevated above all of that. That's right. Well, I just think for those of us that are believers, if we want to be heard by people who disagree with us, we got to cover ourselves in Christ because they're not going to hear you if you're covered in Republicanism or Democrat, blah, blah, blah. They've been trained to dismiss you. And so they're doing a good job. They're getting close to like, if you say you're a Christian, they've been trained to dismiss you. But there's enough of us that grew up in the church that we can distinguish, oh, that's a Christian. He's coming at me and they may dismiss it, disagree or whatever, but at least they know you're coming from a good place. That's where I think we're missing the boat. And by the way, just amen. And that's why it's so important. I just want to say it again, that we've got to not immeasur ourselves with either political party. Yes. We've got to immeasur ourselves. There's a different political party and it's the kingdom of God and the leader is King Jesus. Yes. And I advocate for them to both parties. Yes. So I was talking a couple of weeks ago, I'm at home in Indianapolis and it's even before Jackie Speer made her comments. I'm actually talking to my mother and my aunt about Jim Jones. And my mother made the comment because I was sitting there, she's heard me say it a million times. I was like, man, these ministers that laced their ministry and sermons with politics. But it's a mistake and it hooks us every time. And my mother said accurately, I thought she goes, yeah, sometimes as black people, we fall for thinking we can build a utopian society. And it makes me want to ask you all, and I'll start with you, Anthony, can man build a utopian society here on earth? I don't think so. I think we can do the best we can to make the world better. I think that we can live a Christ like life transforming our families, transforming our neighborhoods. But a utopia, the only utopia that I'm aware of is heaven. Even Abraham, the Bible mentions in Hebrews chapter 11 around verse 10, even he, as he's headed to a promised land, he says, I'm looking for a city whose builder and maker is God. So if we can keep people from not trying to build a utopia, make the world a better place, make your area a better place, do what you're supposed to do in your area, disciple those as Christ would have you to, but we're all seeking heaven. That's the only utopia that I'm aware of. I totally agree. In fact, what we want to do, true followers of Jesus, we want to be in a church that becomes a signpost of heaven, a signpost of utopia. We follow King Jesus, so we forgive each other. We reconcile to each other. We love and serve each other. In our families, people stay married. They work their stuff out. In the home, you've talked about this quite a bit. Men are the servant, Christ-like leaders of their families, where people are encouraged to uphold honesty and truthfulness. So the church becomes a signpost of the real utopia which is coming when Jesus comes back. Yes. And so between now and then, we just try to live it out as best we can. We speak to the government, be they God or a Republican, but we speak from within a community where King Jesus is our leader and we're following Him. I'd like to piggyback on what Bobby just mentioned about the church. It is a family. It is a community that looks like Jesus. And God has always wanted His people to be that model, be that example. As he said, if anybody wants to learn anything about how to treat one another, look at my people. If anybody wants to know, how do you make marriage work, look at my people. They can get a picture of it. They can get a signpost as he says about what this utopia could be, but transforming it all down here, we're going to point back to Jesus. I need you guys to go to youtube.com slash Jason Whitlock. Hit that subscribe, hit that notifications button, hit make some comments. I'll be down there in the comment section reading with all you guys say, we're not going to take a break. We're going to keep the conversation rolling. I just want to throw that in to my next question. What is the proper role of government, Bobby? So Jason and you and I were talking about that this week. There's two roles of government in scripture. There's revelation 13, which describes the Antichrist Empire. So that's really bad. It's government at its worst, the thing most people really fear. Then there's the book of Romans chapter 13, which is the government at its best. So you have the battle between the two passages. Is it revelation 13 government or is it Romans 13 government? So in Romans 13, in fact, let's just throw up on the screen the passage where the apostle Paul describes for us how God wants us to look at government and the role God wants government to play. Here's what he says, let everyone be subject to the governing authorities for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. So he goes on and he talks about give taxes to whom taxes are due, give honor to whom honor is due, that the role of government is to punish crime, to uphold the good and government should be honored. That's a good role for government. Let me just say this, in this ties back in with our conversation around Marxism, God never intended the government to be our be all and end all. God's intention, if you're going to put your eggs in any basket, it would be the local church where the local church lives out this godly life and the government is supportive of that community, but the government doesn't become that community. Now let me go to the danger because I- All for one second, before you get to the danger, because I saw Anthony nodding his head in approval. Is there something you wanted to add to that? Absolutely. I mean, as exactly what he just mentioned about the church, but about government, it is not to be invasive to keep God's purpose and God's plan for man to get in the way of that. So God has a kingdom, a global kingdom mindset for his people and he has evidenced that through his church. He did not want the government to be that. And he has established for governing purposes, as he mentioned, to stop crime and keep us manage, etc. But we live by a higher calling. So I hear all that and my first question is the safety net that government is providing from Social Security to welfare now, all the programs, are we saying that's improper? That's a really good question because obviously it helps people and it's government establishing things that are good and helpful. Up until recent times, like in the last, say, 200 years, oftentimes the church would take that role. We have a copy of the church payroll in the year 253 AD. The ancient church writer Eusebius describes who is on the payroll of the church in Rome. And he mentions 90 elders, 52 exorcists, and he says 1500 widows that they were taken care of all through church coffers. So what's happened now is that churches tend not to take care of each other and they look for the government to do that. And I think that we have to be candid about that, that there's benefits to it with the government taking care of people, but there's also dangers because wherever the government goes, government philosophy goes with it. And government philosophy often becomes more important and has a greater priority than Christian philosophy. So I would say it's attention to be managed, but there are dangers, especially when government becomes everything. And that's the danger of Revelation 13. And you wanted to elaborate on that or you just did? No, no, I will now if you'd like. So in Revelation 13, which not every Christian believes like what I believe about this, but I believe that Revelation 13 describes an end time empire that's government, where governments everywhere. And government becomes its own God or is treated like a God and it's pervasive in everything and it becomes the enemy of God. So let me read the description. Revelation 13 starting in verse 1. John describes it as a beast and it's the imagery that they use in prophetic literature to talk about a political empire. So he says, I saw a beast coming out of the sea. And then he goes on and says, it was given power to wage war against God's holy people and to conquer them. It was given authority over every tribe, people, language and nation. It forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name. So it's envisioning a scenario where government becomes everything and government controls everything and government is against the purposes of God because government is its own God. And from the earliest days, Bible believing Christians have always had a hesitancy about government and about government taking on too much authority because when government does that, it becomes its own religion and its own entity and invested with too much power, it becomes opposed to the things of God. So Bobby, I want you to clarify for our viewers listeners, when you say early Christians, you're not talking about the 16, 17 hundreds, you're talking about long before the end. Yeah, yeah. So the New Testament was completed, probably the last book is the book of Revelation in 90 AD by 125 AD. So this is one of the first books ever written after the New Testament. It's called the Dittake and it envisions a government entity that is opposed to the people of God doing great damage to the people of God like Babylon did of old. They often use the imagery of Babylon from the Old Testament where God's people were in captivity in Babylon. And so they were warning from day one about the role of government being the oppressor of God's people. We've always got to be careful to stand against that. Jesus, he did what he was supposed to do as a citizen and he even encouraged. He was challenged on that notion, should you pay taxes? Should you be a participant? And he responded, give to Caesar what is Caesar's, but give to God what is God's. And as Bobby just mentioned, oftentimes throughout history, the church and government tried to have these partnerships, but it would never work because they have a different end in mind as he mentioned. The government is its own entity and God has a kingdom mindset. So those won't mix. We have to be good citizens. But again, we're following King Jesus. We have an alternative political philosophy and it's that we have allegiance to King Jesus more than anything. Yes. I'm sitting here listening to you guys talk and I don't know if this personal story is appropriate for me to share or even if it helps the conversation. I'm listening to you all. When I was in California, I grew up in a church in Indianapolis. It's a small church, 25th Street Baptist Church in the inner city in Indianapolis. When I was in California, I was providing financial support to my church back in Indianapolis because I had this vision of, and trust me, people would think this church was nothing. It's just a little small little church. We had holes in the roof and I had to put a new roof on the church and all the others. But I had this vision of that little local church being the engine for this whole neighborhood. Wow. And I wanted it to provide jobs and for people in that community and just even if we just started, we're doing lawn care and we bought the equipment and rented it out to people in the neighborhood. But I wanted the church to be the engine for that neighborhood and then we were just going to grow it. Some things happen that I won't go into. But I'm listening to you all talk and a lot of my stuff comes from instincts because obviously I'm not as well versus you all. How come we can't get there to where every church sees itself as the engine for the neighborhood that it exists in and then just grow it out from there? And maybe there are churches doing this, but it's so much what I believe in and to hear you all say and for me to fully now understand that the church should actually be more powerful than the government. Yes. Yes. And we've got it reversed now. Paul mentions it like this. Paul says that we've been given the ministry of reconciliation and that word he's using reconciliation is bringing things back into harmony with God. So our main mission through discipleship, through teaching others and evangelizing to others about Jesus is to bring them back to God. If you grow up in an inner city situation, absolutely your mind is thinking, I got to make a dollar. I got to get out of here. I got to do something and that drive will lead you to things like, well, the government ought to give us a little bit more this or somebody ought to give me a, but when we can tell people you were made by God who created the universe. He has empowered you by the blood of Jesus. When we give them that and let them know your identity is found in God, your purpose, your mission is found in God and we shift that mindset. Now we're not looking to the world to provide us with what God has already given us, but that's a part of our mission. It is as you keep mentioning, it is transforming our communities because if we've got better men in the church, they contribute to better marriages. Those better marriages make better families that contribute to better churches that contribute to better communities, better counties, better schools, better, all of that starts with our mindset being on call. When you talk about the kingdoms of the world, in Daniel chapter two, there's this vision of this little rock and all of a sudden, which represents the kingdom of God. So the church is all about, it's a signpost or a little display of the kingdom of God. And the vision in Daniel chapter two is the church becomes this huge thing that ultimately becomes the kingdom that takes over all kingdoms. And it's the kingdom where King Jesus rules and he rules over a people in the new heaven and new earth where everything is renewed and everything becomes the way God originally intended it. We got to live that out now in anticipation that that's where we're going. You guys have probably already answered this question, but I'm going to ask it again. Government responsibility versus individual responsibility. Is there any particular scriptures or just insight you guys can provide? So let me just contrast the two again, because like you Jason, I'm very concerned and I think everybody should be concerned about the adoption of Marxist philosophy. Because it's really taken over the institutions of our society. It's this Marxism that sometimes isn't even called Marxism, but it basically teaches us that government is the answer to every problem. And the difficulty with that is in the New Testament, there's an emphasis on we are responsible to God and to each other to do our part. And the government is not going to call people to individual responsibility. Let me just give you one little crass example. In the book of Thessalonians it says, he who won't work shouldn't eat. So in a church context, for example, if people are just going to be lazy and not get jobs and take care of themselves like that, the church would hold them accountable for that. In a government situation, you can't deal with the morality of things. Especially under Marxism, morality becomes more about oppression and who's oppressed and who's not instead of practical individual responsibility. So the church again needs to uphold what the Bible teaches on these and not look to the government to do that. I'm not, I listen to that and I think about our belief in government and politics to solve problems to the point that people will put on T-shirts and slogans, vote or die. And I listen to that and I go, you know what, as Christians, we need to come up with a T-shirt, worship or die. Pray or die. Because when I hear voters die, what they mean is, oh my God. And again, I don't want to denigrate voting, but I've never done it because I just don't see it as a priority. I get it from back in the days before I was born and luckily Martin Luther King and my parents and grandparents made sacrifices so that they could change laws so I could experience all the freedom they have. But I've just never, I've never trusted politicians and I just believe in myself and what we as men and women can do for ourselves, particularly those of us that are believers, that if we just worship, if we just put our faith in God and in each other and our ability to accomplish things, we won't die. We will actually flourish. Yeah, the best role of the church is to testify to the government. When you think about Martin Luther King, what did he do? He testified to government of the changes they need to make, but he was a minister. He was a man advocating the ways of the kingdom of God. And if I had a T-shirt, it's, my king is Jesus. My leader, he's Jesus. If we, and so to me the goal, if I'm hearing you all right, is let's make the church more powerful than the government. Yes. Let's make Jesus. That's God's plan A. God's plan A is to change the world through the church, not government. Exactly. Let's see. Let me end on this note, ask you all because, and this is for whatever part of the woke audience I reach out to, given slavery, I want you guys to speak directly to them, how should we feel about America's founding fathers? There's this belief now that they committed sins so despicable that anything that they did is tainted, including the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of Bill of Rights. It's all tainted because of their sin. Is that accurate? It all depends on what you mean by that. Do we make them idols who committed no sins? Well, we're not going to do that. I hope we're not doing that. But just like me, like I was sharing with Anthony as we were coming in, my kids got to the point growing up with me where they realized, and my dad has these faults. I thought my dad was great. I thought my dad was perfect. My son's got a book coming out. And in it, he has this thing where I thought my dad did everything right. And then I realized he didn't. And I went through a real negative period toward my dad. And then he says, I had to work through it to realize, you know, my dad's got faults, but everybody's got faults. My dad is still a good man. I look at the same way of the founding fathers. Did they have faults? Yes, they did. But did they still do good things? Yes, they did in the midst of that. And let's be honest, if we're talking about what the Bible says, like the Bible is full of people with faults that God used. Like Abraham. Abraham is the forefather of the faith for Jews and Christians. And Abraham had sex with his slave Hagar and had Ishmael through her. Now does that mean he did right? No, it was not a good thing, but did God still use him? And you know, you could go through the list of all these people in the Bible. And they're just like you and me, Jason. We've got our faults. But does that mean that our faults totally destroy the good that God still does through us? And I would say, no, they're still good through us, just like our forefathers. They did a lot of good. And we just need to acknowledge they were men of their time with the flaws and faults of their time, just like we have the same tendency. I think part of what comes from that question is that we have lifted our forefathers to almost idle status in some instances that they could do no wrong. They did no wrong. We minimized their faults as if it just really didn't exist. As he brings up Abraham, I think about David, David was a great man of God. I mean, to the church in Israel, they would look back to O King David. But David, you know, he slept with a married woman, had her husband killed. They had a love child. It was a whole messy thing. But because he had gotten so distant from his sin that even when a good friend of his came and told him a parable that was just like his sin, David raised up and said, man, that man ought to be killed. He had become so distant that he didn't realize, wait, that was me. So as we look back at our founders, I'm with Bobby, they did some good things. I struggled with revering them because, you know, some of the stuff they did was heinous. If we take a comprehensive look at them, if you take a comprehensive look at me, I've got some good, I've got some flaws. But the whole story gets told. And I don't mind looking back to them and saying, hey, they did what they did and this happened versus, oh, David just had a little entanglement relationship. No, he got messy, you know. So we got to look at it comprehensively. That's one of the differences in the Bible. The Bible never covers anybody's sin or makes them look better. It never makes them look better than they were. And I think that's part of what we've got to do with history is do both. I got to say, that's what I try to do with myself. Bobby will text me after the show and be like, man, I can't believe you said that about yourself. I'm so proud of you. You're so transparent. And it's really like, no, I want you to have an accurate picture of me. I really do. A really accurate picture because I've done some stuff like holy cow. We all have, I mean, I'm as good as taking. But overall, I want to be remembered for the good stuff that I did. And there's plenty of it. And it's, I was going to be, you got anything? Yeah, I would just like to say that I would like to not be remembered for covering covered in gafford my neighbor's ass. It's cows. It's cattle. Don't the Bible say that? Don't cover it. Not neighbors. Ask. Hey, that the Bible say that? It's don't. I think use that word. But it encompasses that. Okay. I'm still in. Thank you. Past them. Remember this all past the Bobby on the left-hand side? No, I don't remember that. No, come on. Have you been listening to anything we said? I heard every, that's why I felt that was that last part. I felt vindicated. I'm still in, they're still helped for me. I'm not going to come to you next week if you don't crack till. Hey, Jason, if we're ever going to talk about harmony, can I just say this Tennessee harmony? Yeah. Here's what it's about. It's about that we're all sinners who've lost the way and by repentance and by God's grace. That's how we find the way. And grace is so important right now for our nation because it's by grace that we have been forgiven by God and we forgive those. We forgive our political enemies. We turn the other cheek. We try to work things out. We don't view people as evil. We view them as having perspectives that are not right. Sometimes they have ingrained evil in their perspectives, but they're not evil. They're all made in the image of God and Jesus died for all of us. And at the bottom, love is the answer. Love and forgiveness and doing the work of repentance and restoration. All right. It's one of the issues I think as he pointed out, sometimes we put a person's political ideology or their thoughts. We put that to that's who you are. You're a soul that God desires to save. You may have different thoughts on these issues, but you're a soul that God sees that he wants to save so much so that he invested the blood of his dear son. So I want to be forgiven for not starting today with a prayer. So I'm going to ask Anthony and Bobby to end today with a prayer. Anthony, you go first then, Bobby, you close us out. Let's pray. Father God, we thank you so much for your grace, your mercy. Father, we know that you have called us to be just like your son Jesus. We look to him who is the author and finisher of our faith. We pray that what we've discussed here today is pleasing and acceptable in our sight. It's great to be here, God. Thank you for Jason. Thank you for these conversations. And we just want to say that love and forgiveness and the grace of Jesus is the greatest thing. And we pray that that would be the harmony that we can help others to see. In Jesus' name, amen. God, I know he left Uncle Jimmy out. Leave and put him in there too. That's all for us. We pray that we can help others to see. We pray that we can help others to see. We pray that we can help others to see. We pray that we can help others to see. We pray that we can help others to see. We pray that we can help others to see. We pray that we can help others to see. We pray that we can help others to see. We pray that we can help others to see. We pray that we can help others to see."
