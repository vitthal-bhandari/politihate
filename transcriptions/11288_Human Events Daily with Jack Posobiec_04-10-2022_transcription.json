    "text": " Child sacrifice on the Mississippi River. It's happened before In the history of this land. Will it be happening again? Also Elon Musk buying Twitter outright We're gonna break down all the latest and greatest there, but first I want to remind you about border battle Border battle is a new announcement a special limited docu-series available starting Friday October 7th to November 1st exclusively at Salem now Salem Media's group online streaming platform Go check out border battle also if you haven't got your tickets yet secure them immediately Amfest comm use promo code post so for this incredible event with myself Charlie Kirk Tucker Carlson Steve Bannon Benny Johnson senator Josh Hawley Kayleigh McEnany Canis Owens Tim Poole Lauren Chen George Farmer Mike Lindell himself Congressman Lauren Bobert and Ali is stuck you amfest comm promo code Po so Ladies and gentlemen welcome aboard today's edition of human events daily powered by turning point USA Jack Pozobic back in the saddle today yesterday the great Drew Hernandez was here I was up speaking at the University of Delaware with Michael Knowles at a turning point USA event But we're now back here for human events daily today is October 4th 2022 an odominate tonight's headlines Elon Musk Has agreed to buy Twitter the deal is going through we'll walk through everything this means next the Children's Hospital Philadelphia's gender unit co-founder is saying that she conducts research on Homeless children we're gonna explain all that third the first mobile abortion clinic in the United States is opening in Illinois For Kentucky and Missouri women in red states and then finally X Seattle mayor Jenny Durkin Did you think I forgot about you Jenny? She manually deleted 200 text messages from her cell phone during Chas the lawsuit is bringing it all out all this more hedge human events daily Then I think Twitter needs to be much more even handed it currently has a strong left bias Because it's based in San Francisco. I don't think the people that they're necessarily in 10 I would just have some of them don't attend to to have a left bias. They just from their perspective It seems moderate, but they're just coming out of from An environment that is that is very far left so But then this this fails to build trust in to in the rest of the United States and also in perhaps an other parts the world because Twitter needs to be even handed and and be You know, I think I said publicly Victory would be that the The most far right 10% and the most bottom 10% are equally upset Like I don't think this is a situation where you're going to get necessarily a lot of praise You just get it. You're just gonna balance the anger Elon Musk the deal with Twitter is going through and like so many of these big deals It's gone through a lengthy process a court process. It's gone through Delaware Now the question is would Elon Musk have prevailed at court? Well, he's decided to go and make a deal with Twitter. They are reaching a settlement that settlement turns out It's going to be for the original price the 54 20 per share We've got the lawyer out The lawyers letter from them from scadden arbs to Twitter's lawyer confirming the willingness to consummate the deal They're going for the original terms the rigid the offer now is pending receipt of debt financing Proceeds as well as the trial being adjourned. So we're seeing that we're also looking potentially at whether or not there's some handshakes as to how it will be run afterwards This news came out of course stock price just immediately shot up like crazy the shares of Tesla and just tanking Absolutely going down now. What's interesting is that yesterday? You know and why we're wondering why the sudden fold right in zero hedge has the question why the sudden fold and it Says does it have anything to do with the battle yesterday over Ukraine piece did You know was it this issue that he had put forward this this peace plan this potential? Negotiated framework for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia and then was attacked for even having made the attempt Called out by no less than Ukraine's advisor their diplomat and ambassador to Germany But then even the president of Ukraine himself went and called out Elon Musk now suddenly just one day after that boom Because they were already scheduling depositions. They were already getting into we were looking at a deposition for Parang so that's the CEO of Twitter a deposition for Elon Musk himself Those were being settled now zero hedge did have a tweet up a while back that it looked as though Those were being canceled and so they may have had some idea that a settlement was coming But we're wondering yesterday Or would we have known you know would we have known by the end of the week the deposition was going to take place So we're never know what came out in there We did have those text messages recently where we found out that Elon Musk apparently is a fan of revolver news Which I think is amazing. We're a fan of them too Thank you to Darren Beatty and all the great work that he does for his country and for the world over there We would also welcome Elon Musk to be a fan of human events calm and to listen to the human events podcast Whereas we know our problems are with our song about he could be brief. We go on to everybody, but The bigger question for us is the bigger question for us is what does This mean going forward for us for the regime for censorship in not just America, but in the West Will Elon Musk restore Twitter To the champion of free speech that it once was Will the glories of 2016 return will say? because 2016 terrified the regime 2016 is what they don't want to happen again and if Elon Musk Threatens that They will threaten him six ways from Sunday. They will take out SpaceX. They will take out Tesla They will take out all of his companies So that is truly what we're looking at obviously Ukraine Starlink has played him fantastic role there an incredible role there So the question becomes will Elon Musk be willing to step up and do what must be done? Get rid of the bots get rid of the fakery make it real once again If you want to know what the left's real plan is for your kids Just look at the reaction to the work Patriot mobile did in multiple school districts in Texas The left is losing their minds Patriot mobile is America's only Christian conservative mobile phone provider and a force for conservative values That's because they take a portion of your bill and fund conservative causes and candidates who believe in the sanctity of life Freedom of speech the second amendment and they are winning Patriot mobile has afforded plans for you your family even your business and they offer the same great nationwide coverage as the major carriers because they use Multiple major networks plus you're supporting conservative values with every call go to patreon mobile comm slash PoSo and you free activation with promo code PoSo Special discounts available for veterans and first responders join the movement make the switch today We're gonna put the link in the description here patreon mobile comm slash PoSo We Recruited folks from a variety of places across the city of Philadelphia in our own HIV clinic and gender clinic as well as Covenant House and in some some other Community-based organizations and aid services organizations that serve young trans women in Philadelphia And so we did try to do some recruitment through social media Through places where we know that young trans women might be engaging in survival sex or sex work Such as back page or Craigslist Nadia d'Aucien The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Now I started picking up this thread last week Because the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. You gotta understand folks. This one's personal for me I'm from the Philadelphia area and when you're out there, you know the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia chop that we call it that is sacrosanct Their name is Synonymous with the gold standard. They are the gold standard. That's the number one Children's Hospital in the entire country And they're associated with Penn Medicine the University of Pennsylvania Best of the best if God forbid something happens with your kid You want them going to chop you need them going there if you're in that area you take them right to chop You say they'll take care of it because they're the best of the best Well now we're finding out more about what's actually going on behind the scenes of chop when it comes to this gender unit So the chop gender unit in Philadelphia She says And i'm going to say this again We recruited folks from a variety of places across the city of Philadelphia in our own HIV clinic and the gender unit as well as well as at Covenant House and in some other community based organizations and aid service organizations that serve young trans women in Philadelphia Well, what is covenant house you might ask? Covenant house if you're not familiar with the area is the youth homeless shelter This is an area where kids under age obviously who have been out on the street Who are in in some cases? horrifying situations Are now being used as research experiments by the gender unit Of the children's hospital of Philadelphia children's Philadelphia Did you know that? Did you know that when you're making your donation your monthly donation yearly whatever it is to covenant house that those kids Are now the research subjects for gender units the young trans kids I was recently up in Pennsylvania and I was speaking up there spent some time with family I dubbed this a dark alliance because it's not just the children's hospital of Philadelphia And their gender unit Which is doing the exact same thing we know by the way because at Vanderbilt they have them on tape Matt wall scottum on tape. It's a cash cow They want you in as young as possible Whether insurance pays for it. Not we're talking 40 grand up front And then you're paying for Further procedures the rest of your life so the younger they can get you the longer they have you hooked the longer you're paying into the system So who's the children's hospital associates in uh, who's the chopped general unit associated with? Dr. Rachel Levine Who was the physician general for the state of pennsylvania before the good doctor Went over to our hhs That relationship is still there. So Rachel Levine everyone's favorite military officer Is empowering and working with jet the gender unit out of philadelphia's children's And is now looking to take that exact same work to children's hospitals all across the country And what's one of the big things that dr. Levine is doing? The good doctor Once your insurance to have to cover these procedures Once all insurance so the idea is that you're paying into the insurance pool, right? Well, it wouldn't take too much for them to make a change They could even do it through a rule change to abama care that they would then be have to force your insurer That means every time you pay monthly premiums It's going into the pool that's going to pay directly for these procedures that we now know In some cases like the case of philadelphia The research subjects are homeless children orphans What are we doing as a society? We need to step back and figure out who we want to be So We just showed the holy land special here Uh on human events and I got to tell you that one of my favorite scenes is there is when we're climbing up Mount masada on the banks of the dead sea And it was so hot that morning that was about eight in the morning But I got to tell you the heat was already out in the desert right up there as we were climbing up masada But I'll tell you one thing that even as we did that climb by the way about 30 36 minutes that took us to get from from the bottom all the way to the top We used the snake trail and the entire time just gonna say it I was wearing my undertacks and my undertacks are my favorite boxers of all period their period No, I did we did 36 minutes up masada where in my undertack boxers and why we're at was I able to do that I'll tell you why they're my favorite Because they have literally been tested by special force operators Undertack boxers are made with high quality material Anti-microbial anti-pilling moisture good by the I'm not just saying that for the end.

Some might ask it's the right to privacy Think about it as the right for each person to make intimate decisions About heart and home Well in an update in evil this week the us's first mobile abortion clinic will open in illinois in just a few weeks and offer procedures to women in kentucky a mazory where it has been outlawed after rovey weighed uh, well, reading daily mail headline is actually after the overturning of rovey weighed in the dobs decision The mobile clinic it says will include a waiting room in two exam rooms It will be stationed at different points along the southern illinois border The goal is to cut down on travel and waiting time for women out of state A june supreme court decision overturned guaranteed abortion rights for women. I have an option For exactly where they should place the mobile abortion. I do. I'm the mobile abortion clinic In illinois. I'll tell you exactly where they should put it So if you go directly across from the city of st. louis Which in mazory you go right across the bridge and then into illinois across the mr river There's an area there. Maybe you guys could show the map of this There's an area called the kahokia mounds and If you go and and check it out the kahokia mounds really really incredible um Site to see it's in colinsville, illinois just pulled it up And this was the pre-columbian native american city directly across the mrs. Cippy river was the largest and most influential urban settlement Of the mrs. Cipian culture which developed advanced societies that the city out in kahokia by the way I mean it really is the city in kahokia Was actually larger than the city of london at the time of a type so incredible city right there in the center of our of our country right currently the center of the united states And why do I want it there? Well mound 72 let's talk about mound 72 of the kahokia mounds Why should plan parenthood put it there? Well, what was mound 72 archaeologists working at digging at mound 72 found more than 250 skeletons in mound 72 scholars believe that almost all of these were sacrificial victims based on signs of ritual execution method of burial or other factors The skeletons include four young males missing their hands and skulls a mass grave of more than 50 women Around 21 years old some teenagers many teenagers with their bodies arranged in two layers separated by matting Another mass burial of 40 men and women who appear to have been violently killed Some of which have been buried alive from the vertical position Some of the fingers appear to have been digging in the sand It appears that not all of the victims were dead when they were interned that some have been trying to pull themselves out It's been radiocarbon dated to about 950 to 1000 ad These are the excavations at mound 72 so mound 72 was already used as the mass child sacrifice mound In kahokia, which again right across very close to the area where of course plan parenthood Once it's right there in st. claire county in illinois now of course we don't know why The mississippians were committing shot mass child sacrifice But we knew that they were doing it and we're not entirely sure why plan parenthood is doing this today Um, I would say it's in the service of evil and the worship of the god mollock Obviously the pagan deity mollock, but of course That's a great location So I urge you plan parenthood if you're going to set this up you might as well put it there Say it's you know getting back to tradition there in the good old us of a So I know it will shock you that the president is perhaps not giving an accurate or truthful picture We've got four blocks in seattle that you just saw pictures of that is more like a block party atmosphere It's not an arm takeover. It's not a military hunta We will we will make sure that we can restore this but we have block parties and the like in this part of seattle all the time It's it's known for that So I think the president number one There is no threat right now to the public and we're looking we're taking that very seriously We're meeting with businesses and residents But what the president threatened is illegal and unconstitutional And the fact that he can think he can just tweet that and not have ramifications is just wrong The counter will be block parties. Uh, don't take over a municipal building let alone a police station and destroy it So that is two people that have since Exited the public stage and complete disgrace. Chris Cuomo of course is trying to come back a little bit on news nation We'll see how that goes. It won't be well. Tell you right now. It's not going to be a well Problem with a lot of those guys that they're just not very interesting to listen to they're kind of boring When you when you get them on their own they they can't actually carry a conversation They're not an interesting people but Exie atle mayor jerry dare jenny dirken remember her the summer of love comments Before all those people got killed in the chas. Yeah, I remember jenny. I was there I was there night after night cataloging Manually surveilling the violence as it got worse and worse And it was spiraling deeper and deeper Into atrocities and that's what ended up happening Well, we now know That there has been a forensic report that's come out on her cell phone Why did this come out? Because there's a new filing this week from business owners and residents that are suing the city over all the damages That occurred during chats guess what i've got a bunch of those on film as well In fact, I provided a lot of the footage that we filmed for our documentary Um, I still am by the way anti-fumuvi.com that you can go watch All that footage guess what we turned it over even the raw footage to any of the business owners who wanted it Why we said you're free to have it? No rights none of that stuff is needed because this was your homes That she turned over to the mob that she turned over to domestic terrorists for weeks People were forced to live there people were forced to work there And people's children were murdered inside there because of her now she deleted 200 text messages now the question is going to be Why and when did she delete the messages? We know why so there were there being she's being accused now of Of evidence and they're asking the judge to impose sanctions by finding the city liable for allegations in the case Because she's essentially tried to tamper with this case because she's deleted evidence if she's doing that Drop it The whole case is done. You've lost it. You've deprived them of crucial evidence You've deprived them with the ability the ability to actually hear this case City attorney and Davidson's offices responded by accusing the plaintiffs of deleting their own text about chas and court filings The city is requesting that the judge throughout the case In claiming that seattle officials attempted to deescalate the autonomous zone You didn't attempt to deescalate anything raz-semon was going in there Escalating things with his gang every night when they were dealing drugs attacking journalists and eventually getting people killed Right. I've got raz-semon on air pointing gun loaded guns in people's faces Please tell me you tried to deescalate the police were told to stand down and and leave For weeks you turned it over to them Jenny darken these politicians.
