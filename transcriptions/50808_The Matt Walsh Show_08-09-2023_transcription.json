    "text": " Today on The Night Wall Show, another female celebrity has come out to encourage women to get divorced by the age of 30.

In the midst of the Me Too hysteria, when everyone was fixating on Aziz Ansari's bad date and Brett Kavanaugh's phantom gang rape trains, researchers at Morgan Stanley had a very different focus. They were concerned, as you might imagine, about the financial ramifications of the modern feminist movement. So, they sent an analysis to their corporate clients looking into the economic impact of this new wave of feminism that was overtaking the country. And here was their top line conclusion. By 2030, Morgan Stanley wrote, more than 45% of working women aged 25 to 44 in the United States will be single. And if that prediction holds, it would be the highest percentage of single working-age women in this country's history by a large margin. The economic impacts Morgan Stanley predicted would be significant. Morgan Stanley quoted one researcher saying, quote, we find that single women outspend the average household shifting spending policies toward categories most poised to benefit from the demographic growth in single women with rising incomes. Those categories include apparel, automotive, entertainment, dining. Like most research that consultants charge millions of dollars to produce, none of that is terribly surprising. When women don't get married, they tend to climb the corporate ladder. They're invested more in their jobs. When they earn money that they don't spend on kids, they spend on themselves. But there's one line of the Morgan Stanley report that stands out. It's the part where Morgan Stanley specifically urges its corporate clients to encourage women to pursue this unmarried materialistic lifestyle because it'll make the corporations a lot of money. For corporations and investors that embrace these trends, there are numerous benefits from more nuanced corporate governance and performance to bottom line growth. The Morgan Stanley report and several others like it put all the big brands on notice that they should take a proactive role in ensuring that more women become career-driven instead of getting married and having kids. And predictably, over the past few years, we've seen various initiatives along those lines, Facebook, Apple, other big tech companies have begun offering to freeze the eggs of female employees, which is not for any medical reason. They're offering it purely so that women don't get pregnant and don't take maternity leave and can spend more time on the clock. Many companies have also started paying for out-of-state abortions. And all that has been widely reported. What hasn't been covered is the extent to which influencers and celebrities, most of them beholden to these larger corporations, are now openly campaigning all at once for women to remain single or to become single again if they made the mistake of getting married. And you could choose to believe this is all an accident or that it's coordinated. Whatever the case, it's clearly happening. There have never been more famous people telling young women to stop making commitments to men. So for example, you may have seen this recent video from the actress and model Emily Ratajkowski and she has around 2.6 million followers on TikTok where she posts videos telling random couples that their relationships won't last, encouraging women to dress like prostitutes on Halloween, you know, content like that. In her latest video, she extols the benefits of getting divorced by the age of 30 so that women can party and have fun while they're still young and beautiful. Watch. So it seems that a lot of ladies are getting divorced before they turn 30 and as someone who got married at 26 has been separated for a little over a year, 32, I have to tell you. I don't think there's anything better. If being in your 20s is the trenches, there is nothing better than being in your 30s, still being hot, maybe having a little bit of your own money, figuring out what you want to do with your life, everything, and having tried that married fantasy and realizing that it's maybe not all it's cracked up to be and then you've got your whole life still out of you. So for all of those people who are stressed or feeling stressed about that, about being divorced, it's good. Congratulations. Congratulations. Congratulations for failing at something and not just failing at something, but failing at it so quickly. You're divorced by 30, which means no matter when you got married, you fail at it very quickly. So congratulations for failing. Congratulations for abandoning your marriage vows for not staying true to your commitments. Congratulations. It's an achievement, she says. Now, the caption on that video reads, personally, I find it chic to be divorced by the age of 30 and it's extremely popular on the platform. More than 130,000 people have liked that video. Now, this video appears to be a message of support for Sophie Turner, who is a person I didn't know existed, but apparently she does. Apparently, she's a famous actress who is now getting divorced from one of the Jonas brothers because she felt trapped by marriage and by motherhood and she wanted to go party instead. And so that's what she's doing. What Emily and Sophie are doing, getting divorced in a very public fashion for a validly selfish reasons, follows a pattern recently of famous women advising other women to either stay single and childless or get divorced, tear their families apart, and then act like they're childless, even if they have children. Maya Khalifa was another one that we talked about on the show a little while ago as shocking as it was to hear bad advice from a porn star. That's what we got. Here's how Maya spoke to her 37 million followers about the importance of getting divorced multiple times. If possible, let's watch that again. Oh, we're comparing stats. Baby Girl doesn't know that I am Tom Brady at this game. Married at 18, divorced at 21, second marriage married at 25, divorced at 28, third engagement engaged at 29, ended it at 30, but I kept the ring. I'm still keeping Tom Brady on his toes. We should not be afraid to leave these men. We are not stuck with these people. Marriage is not a sanctimonious thing. It is paperwork. It's something it's a commitment you make to someone. But if you feel like you're not getting anything from that commitment and you're trying, you got to go. You got to go. You have to go. I know it's difficult to fill out paperwork and to make appointments and to do all of these things. But this is your life. Do you want to be stuck with someone? Period. Some more great insight there. Now, there are other examples of this kind of messaging recently. Lots of it's now. Chelsea Handler publicly split from her boyfriend after about a year of dating. At the time, Handler made a point to explain that, quote, there was just some behaviors that we couldn't agree on. It felt to me like I would have to abandon myself, which maybe I would have been okay to do if I were 20 or 25, but I wasn't willing to do that. Abandon yourself. Self-sacrifice, in other words, self-sacrifice is a bad thing, Handler says. She lives by this motto. We will give her that encouraging others to do the same as well. She did a whole Daily Show segment a little while ago, extolling the virtues of being selfish and childless. Now, at this point, you're probably noticing a theme, which is that none of these women display even a modicum of interest in sacrificing anything to make their relationships, their marriages, in many cases, work out. Instead, they're adopting without exception what psychologists call an external locus of control. Everything that happens to their relationship is somebody else's fault. Can't possibly be related to them. I mean, they can't conceivably do anything that might salvage their marriage. So they move on and they focus on themselves. Not to belabor the point, but this is the message that young people are seeing all over the place. To give one more example, there was also the country star Kelsey Ballerini who talked about leaving her marriage because the glitter wore off and it would be a disservice to herself to stay in the marriage. I showed this clip a few months ago on the show, but here it is. Is this person right for me? Am I good with this being forever? Am I good with him never doing the dishes ever in my life, for the rest of my life or whatever those stupid things are? How did you know that it wasn't relationship anxiety or negative intrusive voices in your head and that it was actually like your heart speaking? That's a good question. I'm really intuitive and in tune with myself and my gut and my heart. And I think for a while, you're right. It was kind of like, okay, this is just a new phase of a relationship because relationships go through seasons, right? And it's not always going to be rainbows and butterflies. That's just not it. And I think for a long time, I was like, oh, this is just the glitter wears off. That's what happens, you know? And then you get into a phase where you just, you wait for it to come back. And then, you know, and then sometimes it doesn't. But at the end of the day, it is such a disservice and a dishonoring of yourself. If you know something is not right and you stay, but your life is so loud, you know, you have so much going on all the time. I think when people hear about couples counseling, then they hear about a couple getting divorced. They're like, oh, it didn't work. But oftentimes that is actually couples counseling working, you know, like, because you realize that like this wasn't this isn't the relationship for both of you. And I think what's so hard is having to break your own heart and someone else's in the process of saving yourself. An important thing to keep in mind, you know, if you're wondering again why I'm so skeptical of therapy and counseling, well, you just heard it there. You've got a couple's counseling. And then if you get divorced, it means that the couple's counseling worked because they're counseling you towards divorce. But you know, if there's not enough glitter, then what are you supposed to do? Just bail, go party. Whatever you do, don't think about putting in any kind of effort. Hollywood and the media have been pushing this message for a long time. They're doing it with maximum intensity. That's why I started talking, started the show yesterday talking about the insane levels of backlash I received for criticizing an influencer who promoted the child-free lifestyle as a path to happiness. It was a relentless barrage of media coverage all over one tweet that I made on the subject. And that's because I've talked about yesterday. They're very invested in promoting this lifestyle, which means that anyone who criticizes it must be furiously dog piled and shut down. The point is that there's a large scale effort underway to convince young people, especially young women, but not just young women, to be as shallow and selfish as possible, even if it means abandoning their marriages and wrecking their families. Lots of wealthy people and powerful forces are invested in pushing this message. In fact, the government is pursuing it as well. The National Bureau of Economic Research crunched the numbers on this last year, and they looked at federal and state taxes along with benefit programs. And they found that in effect, there's a massive marriage tax in this country. People who decide to get married, especially low-income people, end up sacrificing roughly two years of income to the government simply because they got married. The researchers found that, quote, absent the tax, 13.7% more low income single families, females rather with children would marry annually and 7.5% more would be married by age 35. The researchers also found that the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, imposes a substantial marriage tax, quote, unquote, because people who get married stand to lose a lot of subsidies under that law. Now, you never hear anyone talk about this, but it's true. The government is punishing people who want to get married, especially low-income people. It should be the opposite incentivizing marriage, rewarding you for getting married and having families, but that's not what happens in our country today. And that's a legacy of Barack Obama that's never mentioned. And of course, the current administration is continuing what Obama started last year. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen testified in a hearing that abortion is good because it's good for the economy, because it means that more women are working for large corporations instead of getting married and raising kids. They could just kill the kid, and then get back to work, back into the arms of their corporate masters. Here she is talking about that. Secretary Yellen, if the draft of the court's majority holding in Roe versus Way is the actual decision, what impact will the loss of abortion access mean economically for women? Well, I believe that eliminating the right of women to make decisions about when and whether to have children would have very damaging effects on the economy and would set women back decades. Roe v. Wade in access to reproductive health care, including abortion, helped lead to increased labor force participation. So there it is. Abortion leads to increased labor force participation. Therefore, it's good. It'll put aside the fact that aborting tens of millions of children certainly shrinks the labor force over time, not to mention amounts to a holocaust of human beings on a scale previously unknown to mankind. So no matter how it affects the economy, it is evil on its face fundamentally. Still, that's the Treasury Secretary of the United States saying that women should kill their children and pursue a career at some soulless fortune 500 company because in her estimation, it will boost the GDP. There's no doubt that some of the videos we began the show with today are just women who are rationalizing their own self-destructive choices. But it's a mistake to dismiss what we're seeing as just the idle narcissism of a few famous ditzy women on TikTok. There are forces that profit immensely by creating a society full of self-centered automotons who seek connection and fulfillment from pop culture and social media and all of that rather than family life. And these forces include Morgan Stanley's clients, as well as the federal government. I mean, the most powerful forces in the country, literally. What are the consequences for regular Americans? Well, for women, it's not great. And it used to be that you could say this publicly. It used to be conventional wisdom that it's bad to encourage women to be single. This is a Harvard Business Review analysis from 2002. Quote, Admidlife between a third and a half of all successful career women in the United States do not have children. In fact, 33% of such women in the 41 to 55 age bracket are childless. And that figure rises to 42% in corporate America. These women have not chosen a remained childless. The vast majority, in fact, yearn for children. Indeed, some have gone to extraordinary lengths to bring a baby into their lives. They subject themselves to complex medical procedures, shell out tens of thousands of dollars, and derail their careers mostly to no avail because these efforts come too late. In the words of one senior manager, the typical high achieving woman childless in midlife has not made a choice but a creeping non-choice. A two decades later, that creeping non-choice has been rebranded as a positive. You can never get any article remotely like that one published in the Harvard Business Review today. As disastrous as this transformation has been for women's happiness and fulfillment, it's probably even worse for men. As we've discussed on the show, men are now using more drugs, killing themselves, more than they ever have in recorded history. And these are rates also that far exceed what we find with women. And we shouldn't be surprised by that. When all of society re-oriented to promote girl bosses and to demean the institution of marriage, yes, women make more money in the short term, men also have fewer opportunities to start families and fewer opportunities to make a living. Now, in polite company, you're not supposed to say any of this. You're not supposed to think about the ramifications of the social engineering that's underway in this country. But whether it's acceptable to point it out or not, none of this is an accident. From every angle, women are being told that the key to happiness is being narcissistic, selfish, abandoning marriage, abandoning their families. At the same time, men are being told that simply by virtue of their gender, there are members of a patriarchy that needs to be destroyed. That is as destructive a combination as there possibly could be. In both cases for men and women, the power centers are saying essentially, you're just a passive observer. Women are being told that if their marriage isn't appealing, then they don't have to do anything about it. They should just leave. Men are being told that no matter what they do, they're sexist bigots. This passive approach, this total denial of personal responsibility is unsustainable. As we're seeing again and again, no marriage can survive it. And that's now abundantly clear. And what we'll soon find out if this continues is that no civilization can survive it either.

The Daily Wire reports, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson interviewed a man on his show this week who claims that he used drugs and had sexual relations with Barack Obama before Obama was president. Carlson's interview of Larry Sinclair, who has been convicted and served significant time in jail for crimes involving deceit, who reportedly did not pass a polygraph test administered in response to his allegations involving Obama, comes after recent reports highlighted that Obama wrote in letters to an ex-girlfriend that he sexually fantasized about men. The interview is featured on X, formerly known as Twitter. The full interview is now available. Here's the preview of the interview that Tucker posted before the full interview was posted. This is just a quick clip that gives you an idea of the content of the interview, but let's watch this. You're just a guy who's in town for the night and it sounds like you're looking to party. Yeah. Pulled up in a bar outside and there's this guy that's introduced to me as Barack Obama. I had given Barack $250 to pay for Coke. I start putting a line on a CD tray to snort and next thing I know he's got a little pipe and he's smoking. So I just started rubbing my hand along this thigh to see where it was going and it went the direction I had intended it to go. Even though you had sex with him twice, you did cocaine with him, watched him smoke crack twice. You had no idea who he was. I had no idea who he was. He was asking the obvious question. What was Obama like on crack? Is it your sense that that's who Obama is just transactional or that he's bisexual or like what is that? It definitely wasn't Barack's first time and I would almost be one the bitch it wasn't as long. The guy's running for president and credible information comes out that he's smoking crack and having sex with dudes. That seems like a story. Well it would be a story of the media really cared about telling people the truth. Okay so I have two thoughts about this and my first thought and in fact the very first thought that I had when I saw this was, oh man, I don't know about this one. I don't find this guy terribly credible I must admit it's hard to look at this toothless drug addict and say well you know I believe that guy. That guy, you know, that guy wouldn't lie. That guy wouldn't tell a lie. I mean the claim itself on the face of it is partially believable. The idea that Obama had a sexual experience with a man, I mean that's very easy to believe. That was easy to believe before those letters came out. Now we have the letters where he talks about sexually fantasizing about men and so sure that part of it doesn't really throw you for a loop. Smoking crack on the other hand, I have a little bit of trouble with that. I don't have much experience with smoking crack I admit. I actually have no experience with it much to my shame. I've never smoked crack in my life but as far as I know, I admit this is based mostly on sort of stereotypes, the stereotypes of crackheads but as far as I know smoking crack is not the kind of thing that you do casually. Like if you smoke crack then you smoke crack. You're a crack smoker, you're a crackhead. There's not a lot of moderation. That's why you don't say well as long as you smoke crack and moderation will be okay. That doesn't exist. I've never heard of anyone saying oh I only smoke crack socially. You know only for social events that sort of thing, dinner parties, that kind of thing. It's the only time I release it otherwise I don't. So the idea that Barack Obama was a full-blown crackhead less than a decade before becoming president is, well that would be impressive in a weird way. Like in a weird way that would be impressive. Certainly that would be an inspiration for other crackheads that you can become the president of the United States. It doesn't speak well for this country or the voting base but at least it would be that. It would be an inspiration of the crackheads. I just don't know about that. There are other little details too that make this less than credible. One of them, you know it seems like a small thing but it's actually not that he claims that Barack Obama was introduced to him as Barack Obama but Barack Obama didn't start calling himself Barack Obama until he ran for president or at least until he got into politics before that he was Barry. Now it's always been one of the stories about Barack Obama is that the kind of fundamental fraudulent of this guy is, you know he starts using this name once he gets into politics but before that he was Barry. So little details and big details about this that make it less than credible. Second thought though is well I agree with what Ben said yesterday which is that this guy's story isn't any less credible than the claims for example made against Kavanaugh or many of the claims, many of the claims that have been made against Trump and have been, you know, not just the claims of sexual assault and all of that, the claims that he assaulted someone in a dressing room at a department store those sorts of things. You know have at a minimum or really at a maximum as much credibility as this story from Larry Sinclair and then you know other claims do about about Trump that you know I mean how about the fact that he's a Russian secret double agent which is what we heard in 2016 and going back to Kavanaugh. Keep in mind during the Kavanaugh hearings the media sincerely advanced the notion that Kavanaugh not just that he raped a woman you know and that was for a lot of reasons already an incredible claim with no credibility and there was no evidence for it, no proof. There was as much evidence for that as there is for the claim that Barack Obama smoked crack and had sex with a dude back in 1999. But they went farther than that I remember they also said that he was the actual ringleader of like a gang rape mafia that prowled around town systematically victimizing and assaulting women and they took that claim and they amplified it no scrutiny whatsoever and we talked yesterday for a while a theme that comes up a lot on the show is holding the left to their own standards and so ultimately I see that that's really what's happening here and I think that's what Tucker's up to it's like you guys have set the standard here you know what it's someone on our side if anyone makes any claim at all it doesn't matter there's zero evidence it could be a it could be a claim that is just on its face totally ludicrous but if the claim exists then we will take it and we will amplify it and we will take it seriously and we'll bring somebody on and we'll interview them and then we'll hide behind a well we're just asking oh we don't know we're just asking questions about it we're just we're pursuing a lead is all well so this is once again an area where the left has set up the rules for itself or set up two two sets of rules and they've said you know you guys over here here's here are your rules that you're expected to follow and then here are rules and our rules are that there aren't any rules and what we're finding more and more is that people on the right justifiably so are not willing to play that game anymore they're saying okay these are your standards you've set up then here it is okay let's talk to someone who says that Brett Kavanaugh was the ringleader of the gang rate mafia that's what you're saying okay well then let's bring in this guy who says that Barack Obama smoke crack and had sex with him in a car in 1999 if that's the way you guys want to play it that's how we're going to play it all right uh daily wire has the support democrat state lawmakers are more unified and committed to a leftist ideology than republican lawmakers are to conservatism shocking report shocking this is uh according to the uh conservative political action conference CPAC of course the irony to keep in mind as we read this report from CPAC is that CPAC itself is very much guilty of of this of not being at all committed to conservatism but um putting that aside republicans voted for conservative policies 77 percent of the time while democrats voted for liberal policies 87 percent of the time according to the analysis of all 7,400 lawmakers in the 50 state houses during last year's legislative sessions the study by CPAC's affiliated center for legislative accountability concluded the democrats were more likely to stick together on on issues important to the party's base while republicans broke apart republicans run on conservative promises but after they win more of them abandon the tough votes on key conservative policies when compared to democrats whose first rule is to stick together according to the group our analysis shows how moderate republicans broke apart on key issues like parental choice and education securing strong voter ID of putting a stop to covid mandates the analysis found a mismatch between the desires of the populace and how state representatives acted ranking among the ten states with the most liberal republican lawmakers were mrs. sip uy elming south dakota and idaho that's despite republicans holding strong majorities in those legislators and the state's population overwhelmingly voting for republicans in election after election as a group mrs. sip uy republican lawmakers had an average conservative score of 58 percent making them less conservative than republicans in new jersey maryland and orton uh the state where republicans voted most conservative was a sing swing state of wisconsin so you know as being sarcastic earlier about how this is a shocking report it's actually not shocking it part that part is is somewhat surprising i will admit that according to this report anyway the most liberal republican lawmakers are in mrs. sip uy elming south dakota and idaho whereas you would expect you would expect new jersey maryland those sorts of states to have the most liberal republican lawmakers for this report that's not the case but the overall the overall theme here is one that's um is of course not a shock at all that republicans get into office and we know that this is the case republicans get into office and uh they make a lot of promises on the way in and they say a lot of things especially in the primaries and then when it's time to actually use that power to advance that agenda um they get squeamish and the argument always is for as long as i can remember the argument has always been that well we we can't do that we can't advance this agenda we can't um you know we can't actually enact a conservative policy because because that'll make the other side angry at us and then when they get into power think about all the things that they'll do in retaliation and so we'll we'll just head them off at the pass by abandoning our promises ahead of time and so then they won't be mad at us and then when they're in power uh they'll take it easy on us you know a little bit of sports they'll be good sports about a little bit of sportsmanship but yeah well how how well has that worked and the only question now is we know this is the case with republicans it's been the case again for as long as i've been alive is there any chance that it's getting better we learned our lesson we learned our lesson that you know if you're a conservative lawmaker or conservative politician you get elected that's that's automatically a mandate that's the voters elected you they they want what you ran on that's what they want that's why they elected you so use the power at your disposal to to push the agenda through have we learned that lesson i think that all indications are that we have it more specifically that republicans haven't i mean in fact look at one of the one of the criticisms of let's take someone like uh desantis one of the criticisms one of the big criticisms in fact i just saw some uh some uh people tweeting about this yesterday one of the big criticisms of desantis for example from people on the right is that he signed an abortion ban into law and uh and that was a that was a big miscalculation to sign the abortion ban into law in fact you hear you hear alleged conservatives not just when it comes to desantis but you hear alleged conservatives all the time lamenting the fact that rovey wade was overturned that uh that conservative that some republican legislators are actually uh passing laws banning abortion at a certain stage of development anyway um and some republican governors are signing these bills into law and you hear conservatives complaining about that but we're gonna we're gonna pay a price for that in the election the liberals are gonna be mad at us well you know you know the liberals you know how much they enjoy killing babies so if we stop them look i think i'm mad they're going to be if we stop them from killing babies so we just shouldn't as i've always said about that even i do not buy the argument that um protecting babies from being murdered is so unpopular in this country that if you do it you you have signed your political death certificate death warrant and you'll never be elected again i don't buy that and you know what if that is the case then we're just done as a country anyway okay if we're at the point as a country where if you come out as being against the mass slaughter of infants you're automatically dead in the eyes of the electorate if that's what we are as a country that we're just we're done um but i i don't believe that's the case politically i'm not convinced of it but whether it's the case or not you know you have to protecting babies from being killed is worth doing on its own terms it's just the kind of thing you have to do if you can it's like if you were if you were watching and you were in the room as someone was about to murder a child would you stop and say well if i intervene here how's pop how's that gonna pull how's that gonna work in the polls how are people gonna feel about that i don't know i don't know if i should interview no you intervene you protect the child's life and you do it not because you're a republican because you're a human being for god's sake so there are some things that you just have to do because it's the right thing to do and um and if if that makes you unpopular then so be it but if it does make you unpopular again i mean that that's a that's a failure of communication if people are really that confused about why we should protect babies from being murdered then you know we need to be able to explain that and make that case but the point is that the fact that people that even conservatives still today lamenting rovey way being overturned lamenting when when pro-life laws are put on the books it only shows that you know what this study is is showing here is it's just going to continue it hasn't gotten any better unfortunately all right here's an article in yahoo that i think is a perfect example of how left-wing propagandists use misdirection and red herrings in order to advance their agenda especially when it comes to the trans issue so there's a long article we'll read a little bit of it just so you get a you get a sense of it from yahoo it says the debate over gender affirming kids debate over gender affirming cares tearing our country apart as an unprecedented wave of anti-trans legislation banning health care for transgender children in some cases all together sweeps the nation caught in the crossfire are scores of people who aren't trans but whose lives are also saved by quote gender affirming care and their access to the health care they need is being threatened to activist and author alicia roth wygal knows firsthand that gender affirming care bans gender affirming care bans harm far more than just trans people this is an intersex person activist and author uh knows his firsthand she just she she i'm skipping ahead a little bit in a tiktok video by the washington post roth wygal and activist and author of the memoir inverse cowgirl which details our experiences living as an intersex woman in one of the nexuses of the anti-trans movement texas she described precisely why gender affirming care bans harm more people than many realize intersex is a natural variation in humans in which a person is born with reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesn't conform to the usual definitions of male and female some intersex people like roth wygal also have chromosomes that fall outside of the usual male or female arrangements or that don't accord with their anatomy as she explained in the video despite having xy chromosomes despite being born with internal testes i developed looking very female as freak as uh frequently happens with intersex babies roth wygal was operated upon an infancy to remove her testes despite the fact that i had my testes remain intact my body would have taken the test out stern that they produced and automatically converted it to estrogen instead the procedure quote forced my body into hormone withdrawal and i'm now required to take external hormone replacement therapy similarly to what transgender individuals take without these treatments roth wygal would die uh and then there's another example joustin t brown a man who wrote candidly in 2022 of his teenage struggle with uh gynochomastia disordered in which men develop breast thankfully he came of age in an era before today's politicians began their anti-trans crusade he was able to obtain breast reduction surgery a procedure he would now be legally barred from obtaining in several states in the country okay uh as i said misdirection red herring bringing up things that are totally irrelevant to the issue at hand so we have a claim here this last claim just taking this uh zeroing on this for a second so this is a they're telling us a man an actual biological male who had a who had a an actual medical disorder where he developed breasts and so he got a surgery to deal with that with to deal with that medical disorder that the medical disorder that has a name we know what it is it can be diagnosed and then you can treat it and the claim that they're making and this is what they what they love to do they they they say well with these with these bans on quote uh trans health care that means that we're not going to be able to help people like this that is totally false i mean to begin with it's just a false claim you know these laws most of these laws certainly the law i can say in tennessee they have they have specific carve outs for situations like this that you know we're not going to so for example um a double mastectomy uh a cosmetic a double mastectomy on you know a minor in the in the name of of gender affirmation is not legal but there's an actual medical disorder let's say of breast cancer or something well then obviously in that case it's okay and it's very easy to carve that out and to specify that you have disorders like precocious puberty for example a real disorder where a kid might need to take medicine because puberty has uh the onset of puberty comes much much earlier than it's supposed to naturally because of this disorder um it's very easy to take those kinds of situations and carve them out and say well that's not what we're talking about here the whole the whole category intersects people that men that have disorders where they develop breasts that that whole category has nothing to do with trans whatsoever it's an entirely separate thing and they want to conflate these things because people over in the trans camp they know they have no argument and they know that there's that there's no actual medical need for any of this is entirely cosmetic so they want to rope in these cases over here and make a comparison where the comparison is just not legitimate that that's the whole reason the whole reason why intersex is included now in the lgbt qi whatever acronym there's an i in there somewhere in the midst for intersex they include it in there they they have a symbol for intersex people on the newest version of the pride flag i think it's the little circle on the pride flag it's supposed to be intersex the whole reason why they have been kind of a lassoed and pulled into this is because their existence is convenient for trans it's it's useful to the trans to the t the i is in there because the t can make use of it by conflating themselves with the i when these things are not related at all they have nothing to do with each other intersex once again is a is a genetic anomaly it's a deformity it's a disorder that means that it doesn't mean that a person is a third sex it doesn't mean that they don't have a sex it doesn't mean that there are sex other than male or female all it means in this very small minority of cases is that it can be difficult to determine the sex just by looking almost everyone on the planet that's not the case almost everyone on the planet it's very easy to determine male or female you can tell just by looking when the baby is born the the doctor can can make that declaration and it's going to be correct 99.9 percent of the time because there's nothing ambiguous about it very small number of cases there is some ambiguity to it because of a physical deformity that can be diagnosed and there might be certain treatments that you have to you know that you have to avail yourself of because of that disorder which again has nothing to do with trans whatsoever other than that though i guess they raise a good point on you let's get to uh was Walsh wrong before getting our dog rough greens he was so sad and lazy well now he actually enjoys his squeaky toys and playing fetch with his frisbee our pup's

pundits ever talked to a homeless person homelessness isn't caused by normal middle-class people taking drugs homelessness is primarily caused by broken families generational poverty childhood trauma lack of support etc if you talk to people who are homeless oftentimes they will tell themselves that they started off very disadvantaged um they had drug uh addicted parents so they were always around drugs and could get hooked when they're kids they've always had a sense of hopelessness and despair in their lives it's unfortunately why so many homeless people are actually comfortable being homeless uh i i think that almost everyone recognizes that i think that most political pundits recognize that i assume you're referring to me when you when you're talking about political pundits i recognize that nothing i said about homelessness yesterday contradicts what you said i mean these two things work together um i i never claimed that's uh most homeless people you know we're living in the suburbs and living kind of normal middle-class functional lives and then randomly decided to start uh you know uh doing drugs heroin meth or something and then ended up on the street and there are cases like that i'm sure but those are not most of the cases um i'm yes i'm quite certain that most of the cases are kind of what you're talking about like if you if you were to take all the good go to any random homeless person who's laying on the street on a cardboard box and you were to ask them about their childhood you're you're probably going to find out that they did not have a very good childhood and it's highly likely that you're going to find out that they came from poverty in the broken homes as you say dad wasn't in the picture um in fact we know we know that uh there are plenty of statistics and research on this but just simply having a fatherless home increases the chances of homelessness for the child later in life exponentially so we know all that um that's that's more that that is making my point not debunking it because all this speaks to the fact that once again the the fundamental problem for the homeless person is not simply that they don't have a home it's not simply that they don't have a roof over there that is a symptom it's a serious symptom and it is a problem in its own right obviously but it is ultimately it's not the cause of the problem and if if you solve that if you just put a roof over their head um what you're going to find out most of the time is that it won't be long before they are once again roofless because all these other things drug abuse mental illness uh childhood trauma all of this stuff is still there and the homelessness is a is a is a manifestation of all of that which means that if we want to do something about the homeless epidemic it's not as simple as just throwing money at it giving them a place to stay that that's not going to solve the problem so I think I think actually we agree which is good um banks peninsula says matt you would have sounded more credible if you'd said I like to judge people and tell them how to live because freedom is evil that way at least you wouldn't have sounded like a problem garden variety right wing misogynist just saying yeah this is one of my favorite kind of comments when we talk about you know lifestyle choices people make and yesterday it was about women promoting childlessness and I give my opinion about it and I say you know I don't think that's the best way to live actually and then I'm told that I'm in somehow infringing well let them live how they want stop taking away their freedom just by sharing my opinion I'm what removing someone's freedom to live how they want yeah you do have you have the freedom to basically live how you want within the bounds of the law you have the freedom to live how you want and if you want to live a selfish narcissistic life and you want to not have kids and you want to you know devote yourself entirely to materialistic pursuits and amusing yourself and and all of that and you want to die alone I mean you're you're free to do that no one is no one's saying that you're not but the rest of us are free to to share our views on the right way to actually live and the thing is we all have views on that right we all have views on like what is the actual right way how do we best find happiness and joy what is the best path towards human flourishing that is the actual fundamental question here that we're that we are debating and we all have our view on that for some people their view is well the path to human flourishing is to live for yourself as Chelsea Handler said don't abandon yourself don't don't don't engage in self-sacrifice live for yourself that is a view that's a point of view that I happen to think is wrong MT says what an extremely lucky man you are Matt you've never been depressed or suicidal you've never suffered through an addiction I'm glad you're so strong but not all of us are and telling people they can just stop doing something we'll never give them the courage to try a much better way to help someone you care about fight their addictions is to encourage them make them accountable walk through the baby steps with them little by little making tiny efforts every day that will lead to freedom from their addiction with this approach they won't feel helpless at the beginning it'll seem manageable and with you to guide encourage them they will get through it because guess what it is an addiction and you can't just stop but you can I mean you're talking about pornography here I'm not I'm not denying the existence of addictions addictions do exist you can be addicted to heroin that's for sure you can be addicted to heart drugs you can be chemically dependent on them you can be so dependent that if you stop taking them all at once you might die then even if you don't die you're going to be in severe physical pain suffering the pains of withdrawal so that does exist a porn is not one of those things and simply just reasserting restating your assertion is not an argument okay I laid out my whole argument for why addiction is one category and the compulsion to watch porn is in a different category it's a different kind of thing and all I've seen are comments like this that are just they're not arguments it's not a counter argument you're just restating your assertion you're saying no but it is no uh it's not an argument are you actually telling me that let's put the words aside for a moment okay on one hand you have someone hooked on heroin who if they stop taking all the ones they'll die now the other hand you have someone who who very much likes watching pornography you're telling me that those are those are the same category you don't see any substantive difference between those two things really it's just it's absurd and I think you can tell the difference so whatever words you want to use there's there's a there's a there's a category over here there's a category over here and I think that we need different words to describe those categories because they are different kinds of things and when it comes to pornography in fact you can just stop as I as I as I said you know if I offered you I said a million I think but let's say what if I offered you let's bring me off or down I'll give you a thousand bucks I'll give you a thousand bucks to not watch porn for a week could you do it you definitely could you absolutely could for a thousand bucks you could do it anyone could you're not going to say no I don't want the thousand I'll I'll just I want to watch porn you'll take the thousand bucks won't you which in and in and of itself proves proves that you can stop if you feel you're incentivized enough but you do have the ability and if anyone if there's any hope of someone changing their behavior adopting better behavior it has to begin with them acknowledging that they do have the power to change and that's the point here is you have to mix get people to acknowledge that they can't you they're not going to change without first acknowledging that change is possible that they do have power over their own behavior and the choices that they make how are you I mean it's very nice what you're talking about oh you want to guide them step by step on the road to recovery how are you going to get them on that road if they don't even believe that they have any power over their own behavior and their own choices it's got to start with acknowledging that and then they can get on that road there's no other way to do as far as I can tell are you one of the millions of American men and women dealing with premature hair thinning and hair loss or maybe you're scared about

hiatus for several months now because of the writer strike this comes as news to most americans who had forgotten that those shows existed uh late night talk shows of course haven't been relevant least of all funny since approximately maybe the year 2003 in fact i was surprised to learn that they were impacted by the writer strike at all as i assume that they didn't have writers but they do and in spite of the strike and the general lack of relevance one late night show has managed to make the news this week for all the wrong reasons rolling stone has the big expose on the tonight show with jimmy phalan here's the headline chaos comedy and crying rooms inside jimmy phalan's tonight show 16 current and former stavr say phalan's erratic behavior spoiled their dream of working on the tonight show now as you can tell from the title this is yet another shocking report about a so-called toxic work environment we're seeing these kinds of uh things with increasing frequency you might even say that the uh the toxic work environments are having their me too moment first it was ellen degenerus then earlier this year thanks to another rolling stone expose we heard that the kelly clarkson show is a toxic environment where employees feel stressed out and they get yelled at sometimes and they start crying and their mental health is severely impacted then a few weeks ago the american psychological association released a new study claiming that uh 20 of all workers in america which is about 30 million people give or take are in workplaces that are toxic and half of them say that their mental health has been harmed by all the toxicity in the workplace and now we have this revelation about jimmy phalan toxic work environments are an epidemic it seems which raises the question what exactly is a toxic work environment and how does it significantly differ from a regular work environment let's read a little bit of this rolling stone report to see if it might help illuminate the issue for us quote according to two current and 14 former employees the tonight show has been a toxic workplace for years far outside the boundaries of what's considered normal in the high pressure world of late night tv they say the ugly environment behind the scenes starts at the top with phalan's erratic behavior and has trickled down to its ever-changing leadership teams nine showrunners in the past nine years who seemingly don't know how to say no to jimmy former employees describe the tonight show as a as a tense and pretty glum atmosphere with some alleging that they were belittled and intimidated by their bosses including phalan himself employees describe being afraid of phalan's outbursts and unexpected inconsistent behavior seven former employees say that their mental health was impacted by their alleged experiences working at the night show these staffers say it was commonplace to hear people joking about wanting to kill themselves and that they would refer to guest dressing rooms in the office as crying rooms because that's where they would go to let out their emotions when they are upset with their alleged mistreatment well this sounds uh potentially bad so far employees are breaking down in tears at work they're talking about killing themselves what exactly is happening to these people like what is jimmy phalan doing to them like what specifically is he doing what terrible atrocities are being inflicted upon the tonight show staff well let's keep reading and we'll find out quote it's a bummer because it was my dream job one former employee says writing for for late night is a lot of people's dream jobs and they're coming into this and it becomes a nightmare very quickly it's sad that it's like that especially knowing that it doesn't have to be this way but behind the scenes there was a surprising dramatic and ugly shift in the working environment according to three employees who originally worked for late night with jimmy phalan and then followed the team to the tonight show of course there was the added pressure when the program transitioned the tonight show is one of the televisions most storied franchises quote the producers felt this pressure and that translated down to all their employees people that worked under them and then felt this pressure that if you made one mistake you were gone and would be easily replaced one former employee says quote you have all these nbc pages in the building who are ready willing and waiting to take your job okay at this point we've learned that some of the employees expected the job to be a dream and it wasn't and they also felt a lot of pressure and they were afraid that they might be fired and replaced so far it sounds like this toxic work environment is just literally every work environment but maybe we haven't gotten to the really horrific stuff yet so let's uh continue quote nobody told jimmy no everybody walk on eggshells especially showrunners another former employee says you never knew which jimmy you were going to get when he was going to throw a hissy fit look how many showrunners went so quickly uh we we know they didn't last long with an ever-changing cast at the top employees say that they had nightmares related to work and we're in a constant state of fear one former employee says that they had their first anxiety attack while working at the show and we're put on anti-anxiety medication for the first time another employee says that they felt physical ramifications of their declining mental health like their hair thinning and weakened nail beds for other employees say that they're in therapy because of their experiences three say they experienced suicidal ideation as a result of the working environment one employee says that they lost nearly 20 pounds during their time working under showrunner granite beaterman and felt like they were on edge all the time and cried themselves to sleep every night so we're still hearing about the emotional devastation all these employees experience crying themselves to sleep every night crying at work crying everywhere all the time in therapy losing weight we haven't heard what exactly happened to them to justify this kind of reaction from the sound of it these people are are having the emotional reaction you'd expect from someone who's i don't know that whose house just burned down with their entire family inside i mean they are describing deep profound emotional trauma crying yourself to sleep every night that's like grieving the loss of a loved one okay so what could possibly have happened to them at the office to cause this kind of reaction we still haven't heard so let's continue according to most employees who spoke to Rolling Stone it's common knowledge that behind the scenes uh Fallon's temperament mood and treatment of staffers is erratic these employees say that they've witnessed Fallon's snap at crew members express irritation over the smallest of things berate and belittle staffers out of frustration three four employees say that he berated them in front of other colleagues and grew and crew members one employee says that depending on Fallon's mood they felt like his notes and feedback could be passive aggressive personal insults as opposed to constructive criticisms they say that he would write comments like are you okay seriously do you need help Rolling Stone reviewed photos of the employees alleged notes from Fallon that read ug lane what is going on with you you've outdone yourself the same employees say that Fallon would also send combative emails one of his reviews reviewed by Rolling Stone to certain staffers if he was dissatisfied with their work two employees remember witnessing Fallon's scold the crew members crew member who was in charge of his cue cards in the middle of a taping with comedian Jerry Seinfeld they say it was an uncomfortable moment okay i could just stop this here and spoil the ending because this is it there is no shocking revelation about horrific abuse being inflicted upon tonight show staffers but like it's just this the boss gets angry sometimes and yells he criticizes employees who who dissatisfied him on occasion there's some passive aggressiveness sometimes people get fired the closest thing they get to an actual shocker is that two employees claim that Fallon seemed potentially inebriated at work once six years ago which if true of course is bad but there is nothing here that could even remotely justify crying fits and panic attacks and employees running around threatening suicide okay this is not a toxic work environment it's a it's a fragile work environment staffed by a collection of emotionally stunted crybabies who break down in tears if they experience a little bit of pressure or if the boss gets a little bit a little bit mad sometimes look i i'm no Jimmy Fallon fan i have no dog in this fight i have no instinct to defend him or any real interest in defending him but my general ambivalence towards Jimmy Fallon is overridden in this case by the intense revulsion i feel towards this generation of overgrown children masquerading as adults who can't handle even the smallest amount of stress and that's where this idea of the toxic work environment comes from now there might be some workplaces that really are toxic in a more significant sense but for the most part when someone complains about their workplace being toxic what they really mean is that their workplace is a workplace that they have to deal with other people they have responsibilities they have to perform you know they they they have to justify their existence and their job there's pressure there's stress tempers flare sometimes people disagree co-workers and bosses have eccentricities that can be annoying and frustrating it's a workplace it's life as an adult this is how it goes now just to drive the point home home here recently Forbes published a list of the 10 signs that you're in a toxic workplace and and here are some of the signs it says that your workplace is toxic says Forbes if you are physically and mentally exhausted at the end of the of each workday if your manager asks you to be available to answer emails in the evenings if your colleagues complain about work or if your co-workers sometimes make offensive jokes that is a toxic work environment so again a toxic workplace is just a workplace it's any workplace now that's not to say that people should make offensive jokes or even that your boss should expect you to be available off hours but these things happen and when they happen it just means that your workplace isn't perfect it isn't flawless indeed as Jimmy Fallon's staff discovered it isn't a dream there's no dream job because life is not happening in a dream it's reality stuff happens sometimes that you don't like that that doesn't make it toxic you emotional infants and it certainly doesn't justify crying fits or acting like you have PTSD you didn't get your legs blown off on the battlefield you answered a work email at 7 p.m. you'll be fine stop whining see this is the real story with the epidemic of toxic work environments once again the problem isn't the problem itself but the total inability of grown adults to deal with the problem you know there are always going to be workplace pressures and angry bosses and annoying co-workers encountering these challenges that doesn't make you an abusive victim it makes you a normal adult existing in a reality that won't always or in fact will never comport entirely with your dreams you either learn how to cope with that and succeed in spite of it or you can cry like a toddler and look for pity in a pat on the head unfortunately many people these days choose the latter and for that they are today canceled that'll do it for the show today and this week thanks for watching thanks for listening have a great weekend talk to you on Monday godspeed"
