    "text": " Today, Budweiser steps in it yet again after coming out with a new ad campaign. The UN tries to normalize sex with minors and the House Judiciary Committee, travels to New York City to address crime. We've got all of that and more coming up and it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. Happy Monday. I am Saragans Ales and quick to try and recover from the trans madness and fallout after the short-lived Dylan Mulvaney partnership, Anheuser-Busch took another stab at actually advertising toward their market demographic, which as it turns out, not real big Dylan Mulvaney fans. Shocker. The company released a new noticeably pro-America Budweiser ad featuring one of their signature Clydes deals running across the country while a narrator talked about the American Spirit Watch. This is the story of the American Spirit. Well, spoiler alert, if Bud was looking to patch things up with their consumers, they did not achieve that goal. The backlash was swift and severe. Americans were seemingly more annoyed than ever that not only did Budwe completely betray their formerly loyal consumers, they also didn't acknowledge the betrayal at all. But the views whoopi Goldberg insists that it shouldn't be a Democrat or a Republican issue because beer just isn't political watch. Right now, that's right. Ignited an angry conservative backlash and a boycott that included online trends of people posting videos destroying cases of Budweiser in various stupid ways. The company puts out a statement saying they didn't mean to address an issue that divided people. But I wonder, what are you so angry about? Beer does not have a... I mean, it's not a Democrat or a Republican. It doesn't have a belief system. It's just beer. Oh, it's fascinating that the same people who created the boycott culture, the same people who wrote the playbook for using public pressure in order to mainstream their ideology now, all of a sudden, don't want companies to be political. Who do you think started this whoopi? Who do you think made it impossible to separate private companies from politics? Who insisted on incorporating ESG and DEI into American businesses? Who forced companies to post black squares on Instagram to support the domestic terrorist group Black Lives Matter? Who insisted every company that ever existed put out a public statement on their thoughts about the Ukrainian war? You? You guys did that. And now that we're following your playbook, you want to change the terms of the game? Beer isn't Democrat or Republican? No. Everything is now Democrat or Republican according to you. You set the rules. So let's play the game. Here to discuss this and more, I have Chad Prather, host of the Chad Prather Show and Lieutenant Colonel Allen West, of course, former congressman and the executive director of ACRU. Thank you, gentlemen, for being here today. It is just... It's mind-boggling to me that now that conservatives have finally, I don't know, gotten their head out of their ass as long enough to do something like this, like actually make a change, actually stand up and say, we're not going to do this anymore. Now, all of a sudden, oh, please, beer is just beer. It's not Democrat or Republican, as if they have not been forcing every single private company to make some sort of a political statement for the last, what, 10 years, five years? Yeah. I look, I'm enjoying watching it. Yeah. And I get... Anheuser-Busch employs a lot of people who have nothing to do with this debacle. And if they continue to lose profits, then those people are going to be the ones who suffer, which is all the more reason why people like us who have a platform need to speak out against this because as long as the Anheuser-Busch is of the world, who are members of the world economic forum are continuing to get pressure from the vanguard and the black rocks and the WES to be a company that's building their ESG scores and making sure that their woke agenda is the narrative that's being pushed. Listen, if the big companies are going to cave to it, the little companies in America don't have a chance. I mean, they'll never survive. So, it's now that I think we do have to stand up and say, okay, we're not going to be ruled by your paradigm and your worldview. And when you push this on the American people and you say, well, it's not about beer. It's about pushing a transgender agenda, a transsexist agenda in the wake of a shooting that was carried out in Nashville, Tennessee by a transgender terrorist. And you threw everybody under the bus and said, you know, we're just going to ignore that and we're going to make this guy who has pretended to be a little girl for 365 days, a voice for this dysphoria. And I'm glad to see it. I mean, every store I go into, I always check to see how much Bud Light's still on the rack and it's full. Nobody's buying that swill. I mean, there's not doing it. I'm not a beer drinker. I mean, I go a little harder than that, but I'm not really missing out on anything. Colonel? Well, first of all, we got to ask, did the Closdale identify? I mean, we got to make sure that that's clear. But it's so interesting, so hypocritical that the view is on ABC. And there's another show that's on ABC called Dancing With The Stars. And I remember when Sean Spicer was invited to be on Dancing With The Stars and the left went apoplectic saying that let's not look at it, get kicking off of it, whatever. So, you know, maybe she forgot that the network that she's on, you know, tried to go after and cancel a program and kick off a conservative person. But you're right. This whole thing about what, you know, Bud and Nike now with the sports bra, what they're all doing is because of a leftist organization, the Human Rights Commission or council, whatever, they call themselves, which is a major LGBTQIAWXYZ organization funded by George Soros. And they're coming out with this corporate equity index and they're putting pressure on these corporations to do exactly what Bud like did. So again, they need to look at themselves in the mirror because they're the ones that are going out there saying, you better do what we want or else. And that's just the bible. I mean, Mrs. Butterworth, they erased a black woman. Angie Maima, they erased a black woman. Uncle Ben's. Uncle Ben, erased a black man. They kept Quaker Oats, dude. They kept Dylan Mulvaney. So two white guys made it through the land of lakes is an interesting one. They kicked the Native American off and kept the land. That was your sound familiar. So, Colonel, you mentioned you want to know how the horse identified, the Clydesdale identified. I want to play for you guys Mr. Reagan, a great, great follow on YouTube. You guys should check his channel out. He created a parody to this Bud Wiser commercial. Let's watch that. Hi there. My name is Prancer. I identify as a reindeer. This ad is what we call damage control. Our thinking is maybe if we post an ad with our iconic Clydesdale that identifies as a reindeer and we say vaguely patriotic things. This is the story of the American spirit. People will like us again. Incidentally, I used to have a deep, rich baritone voice. Then I started drinking Bud Light. It changes you. Look at these two typical American firemen. We can't put two white people together in an ad. We still have to virtue signal a little. I mean, we're still folk. We're just not that folk. Here's another couple of people, also two different races. I mean, honestly, what we really need to do is just say, well, we fucked up. But we all know that's not going to happen. So just look at the pretty horse that identifies as a reindeer and drink Bud Wiser again. If you don't, they said they're taking me to the glue factory. Look, there's two more dudes. Is that guy white? Is he Hispanic? Nobody knows. He's what we call ethnically ambiguous. Our favorite race of all. This white guy gets it. So remember, folks, at Bud Wiser, we'll always be a little woke. This Bud's not for you. You know, maybe cutting my tail off as a mistake. What do you guys think? It's too late now. No coming back from that. It's great. And it really is offensive and condescending that somebody at Ainhart's abushed it. Let's just, you know, put this commercial together and they'll forget it all. Right. Right. Well, we'll win them back with the Clydesdale. It's condescending. It's totally condescending. Yeah. That's how little they think of you. Yes. So they made it worse. Right. They made it cut in the lures. Yeah. It's salt in the wound. And they don't care because first of all, this, we are the American spirit. You're owned by Belgian companies. And then, or a handshake matters. St. Louis, really? I don't know how many of y'all been in St. Louis. Yeah. I don't know how often y'all go to St. Louis these days. Don't. But yeah, this is a very patronizing, condescending way of doing this, but they don't care. And they don't have to care because they've got the black hole depths of money behind them as benefactors to make sure as long as they do the woke agenda, they'll be fine. So speaking of that, over the weekend, I don't know how many people are still watching Saturday Night Live. Is there seven? Maybe. It's up to seven? I think it's the cast. It's just the cast and like there's spouses. Yeah. It's watching it. So they introduced their first yay non-binary cast member. This is Molly Kearney who uses they-them pronouns and went on SNL to talk about the growing list of, you know, anti-trans laws moving across the country. It's always anti-trans. We don't want to mutilate children. That's anti-trans, she says. Watch. Those were far too long and I'm starting to feel like a frickin Republican lawmaker. Hello. That's an awesome transition. So as of this week, there are now over 14 states that have passed bills restricting healthcare for trans kids. Listen to that, Michael. Yeah. Restricting healthcare for kids. For some reason, there's something about the word trans that makes people forget the word kids. If you don't care about trans kids' lives, it means you don't care about frickin' kids' lives. Comedy show. I thought this was a comedy show. Oh, oh, but wait. It's not supposed to be political. It's not supposed to be Democrat or Republican. Oh, but wait, that it literally is always about politics with these people. And it's fascinating if you don't want a child to get mutilated, you don't care about kids. That's really weird dichotomy I'm hearing right now. So remember what? Year ago, 18 months ago, the big topic was toxic masculinity, right? They went after that. You had to have the beta males, anything that was masculine was evil. So they went after that, basically destroyed the idea of manhood. Then they went after women because this rationalization is a complete, I mean, they're stereotyping women one thing, but they're not only taking their place in sports and positions of society, but they're going after the children, right? And the children are most vulnerable among us. And not only has the abortion issue been a major thing for a long time, and certainly we've talked about that with the repealing of Roe v. Wade, but now they're going after born children. And just call it, and again, because if you can redefine men, redefine women, masculinity, femininity, then you can redefine things like healthcare. And you can call lopinoff genitals and chemical castration and hormone therapies. You can call that healthcare. That's not healthcare. That's medically altering someone. That's a slasher movie. That's like kind of the opposite of healthcare, Colonel. It's totally the opposite of healthcare. And it's not gender affirming care. It's gender mutilation because you're still a biological male, a biological female. You're not changing your DNA, your chromosomes, you know, or any of this type of stuff. But what is interesting to me is that the biological female who plays in La La Land, that thinks she is now a male that goes into a Christian school and shoots three nine-year-old kids, two of which were little girls, that's okay. No one cares about their lives. But if you prevent us from being able to go in and mutilate bodies of children, you are now, you are restricting them from having healthcare. Now what is so disconcerting and disturbing for me now is that the military is coming out and saying that we will go down and we will do this to your children in the military. And we want to inform you of that. So no parental consent. These are people in the military. So now all of a sudden I am deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan. And the next thing you know, someone makes a decision that they're going to put my child under mutilation surgery. So when I come back from Iraq or Afghanistan, you know, my daughter's breast has been lumped off because she says so and you did not inform me and tell me that. That's why we have this lack of retention, lack of recruiting in our military because they're telling us that our children aren't our children. We own your children. And the fact that the state of Washington just passed a law that says you will go to jail parent if you do not allow your child to say that I want this surgery done. They can't go out and vote. They can't go out and smoke. They can't go out and buy a Bud Light if they want to buy Bud Light. They can't go out and go buy a gun. But somehow this child under the age of 18 who cannot vote can make a decision about surgery. And with the military thing, it's gotten so, so bad in the military with this wokeism. And I feel like it just kind of goes back to Chad, what you mentioned with coming after what they call toxic masculinity. And now however many years later, we have a military that has just completely lost its balls. Both metaphorically and literally because they're just chopping them off and then telling them that they're women. So it is really frightening to see, continue to just go further and further down that slippery slope. All right, we got to take a quick break. We'll be back with more. I want to thank our sponsor Birch Gold. So I don't feel like I have to tell you guys this. If you watch this program, you realize that inflation has pretty devastating consequences. And as a Fed raises interest rates to combat out of control government spending, long-term bonds have diminished in value. It's crippling banks. Depositors are just holding their breath and investors are bailing on bank stocks. Now is the time to diversify. Okay, the recent surge in gold prices is directly tied to the extreme market volatility right now, which is why gold has historically been a really, really great hedge against the stock market and against inflation. Go talk to my friends over at Birch Gold Group. Let me just tell you this. I'm not just reading an ad to you. My husband and I had an hour long conversation with the people over at Birch Gold just last week to talk about how much more we wanted to diversify after we already have because we don't want our money to sit in a retirement account where it's just going to continue to waste away and get smaller and smaller and smaller. Don't do that. Go talk to them. They can help you convert your existing IRA or 401k that's tied to that volatile market into an IRA in precious metals. So you can text the word Y to 9898 to get that free information kit on gold. That is the word Y. Text the word 9. Y to 9898. 988. We appreciate all of you watching, especially if you're watching on Blasted Me. We appreciate you being the subscriber, but we realize we have a lot of you watching on YouTube as well. So if you are watching on YouTube, we would appreciate it if you would go ahead and hit that like button and make sure that you're sure that you're sure you're subscribed. I swear to you guys, every single day I have more people tell me they didn't realize somehow they had been magically unsubscribed from this channel. So make sure and comment, let us know what you think about the news of the day, especially this story. Very shocking report. We're talking about where all of this goes. How far down are we on the slippery slope? There is a report. This is the eight March principles for human rights-based approach to criminal law prescribing conduct associated with sex, reproduction, drug use, HIV, homelessness, and poverty. This is issued by international legal experts with the backing of the UN, the United Nations. And it's just that it's trying to normalize sex with minors. So it says sexual conduct involving persons below the domestically prescribed minimum age of consent to sex may be consensual, in fact, if not in law. And it does not actively call for decriminalization of sex between adults and minors, but it does state, remember, we are in a slippery slope. It's not all at once. It's a gradual process. It does state that children have both the capacity and the legal right to make sexual decisions. Conveniently, it does not offer a suggested age of sexual consent. So it doesn't say when, does say children do have the capacity and the legal right to make these types of decisions. You know, I have a friend who, I have a friend who's in the comedy world and she traveled with me for a period of time, opening shows for me and stuff like that. And she said, I can never stay in a hotel that opens to the outside. I have to stay in an internal hotel. And we were like, we'll try to accommodate. No, she said, I have to. She said, because my grandfather pimped me out with a child and he would take me to a hotel and his friends and his clients would come and they were these types of hotels. She said, I can't go to a hotel like that. You hear these stories like this that you read something like this is wanting to normalize this and launder it out to the public and say, this is okay. It's not okay. I mean, this is rape. This is child rape if you can even, it becomes more heinous at that point. But can we go back to just letting kids be kids and not let kids have to make these major life decisions like what their genitals are supposed to look like. And, you know, I mean, the rules were so much simpler when I was a kid. You know, when the, when the, when the dinner bell rang, we came running, we better be able to hear it. You know, we didn't sit around in the woods trying to figure out if we wanted our testicles or not. Yeah. But these kids are being bombarded or whether they have to make a sexual consent decision. And this is insanity. This is not, I promise you, children are not sitting around thinking of these things. These are adults who are sitting around thinking of these wild ideas. So, so let me, let me go through some of these quotes from this report. So this is Ian Cedarman, Law and Policy Director at ICJ. It says, criminal law is among the harshest tools at the disposal of the state to exert control over individuals as such. It ought to be a measure of last resort. However, globally, there has been a growing trend towards over criminalization. We must acknowledge that these laws not only violate human rights, but the fundamental principle of criminal law themselves, and then moreover, sexual conduct involving persons below that domestically prescribed minimum age of consent to sex may be consensual, in fact, if not in law. You know, Robert Bork wrote a book called Slouching Towards Gamor. And this is where we are. And we should not be surprised. We've sat around and allowed an organization called North American Manboy Love Association to exist. We have now hear people talking about, you don't refer to people's pedophiles. They're minor attracted persons out in California. They tried to float a law that, you know, the age of consent would not be a criminal prosecution. So these things have been, you know, out there as targets from the left, but you're absolutely right. Why can't we let the children be children? Why now are we sexualizing our children and we're allowing adults to see them as sexual entities? This is, it is evil. And I was on here a couple of maybe three weeks ago, and you were talking about how people get upset because you keep talking about this. Well, we have to keep talking about this because they keep talking about this. And the minute that we stop, guess what? They're going to fill in that gap. Again, they don't believe that our children are our children, and they're doing everything to implement their agenda against our children. So there is a war on children. They don't want you to be born. They want to decide that. And if you are born, they want to decide what you can be or your sex or who can, you know, then violate you. This is very dangerous and very sick. But oh, by the way, if we do show concern about our children, then we don't care about their health care. So I guess it's okay to allow children to be raped by adults because therefore you concern about their health care. You know, when it comes to introducing children to sex as well, it's shocking to me, the number of people who have just resigned themselves to the excuse, well, they're going to see it on their phone anyway. As if, A, you have to give your child a phone with access to the internet. And B, it's just, it's so mind boggling to me that they're like, well, I mean, they all have phones. They're going to like, I'm sorry. There are some of us out here who haven't just completely, you know, neglected our parental responsibilities in exchange for a babysitter called the iPhone. It just blows my mind how fast people say they're going to see it on the phones anyway. Like, no, not if you're not if you're a mindful active parent. No, not in my house. Well, it is problematically epidemic that one out of studies are saying now that one out of four children, minors are in some form addicted to expose to pornography on a regular basis. And you know, you make a great point, Colonel, because there's no such thing as a vacuum when it comes to power. So you, you remove yourself from a space, whether it's education or, or whatever it is, the power is going to fill that vacuum. It's going to be the wrong kind of power. Now, what we're seeing is a sexual deviant see that you just look at it and you go, I can't believe we're even talking about this. Which if you just stop talking about it, it would go away. No, no, that, that vacuum is going to continue to be filled up, but it's going to be the wrong, wrong thing. Every major culture that's ever existed in human history, the final step before the downfall of that culture was sexual deviant see. And we're normalizing this arguing, they're arguing for it. So if you think we're, you know, not going to fall prey to that, you're wrong. Right. It's like, it's just, it's, it's the, you just give up, right? That's their answer is just like, well, they're going to see it on the phones anyway. So oh, well, oh, well, we'll just, we'll just expose them to it as if there's not an alternative option. That's what they want. They want you to surrender. Right. And think about it, who would have ever thought five years ago that there would be parents taking their kids to drag queen shows and grown men exposing their genitals and, and privateers to kids or telling your kid to go up there and put a dollar in the garden. I mean, once upon a time you got, you would get carted away for that. So what's next? I mean, we can take our kids, I guess, into the triple X store, or we should sit down with our kids and watch pornography. You know, there was once upon a time, parents could sit down with their kids and watch the grannies. Yeah. Can't do it anymore. And so it is just now crept into every aspect of our lives. And if we don't stand up and push back, then we're giving them a high growl. And that's why we have to fight 24, 7, 365. And it is evil. I gotta tell you, if you're the president of the United States of America, or a candidate they're of, one of the things you should say, screw to UN. We're getting out of the UN because we're not giving up our kids, we're not giving up our rights and freedoms, we're not giving up our guns to some small arms treaty from the UN, all of these things. And I don't believe that the United States should be sitting at the table with China and Russia. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Amen. All right, let's go ahead and take another quick break.

Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen. But when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blazetv.com slash The Blind. The House Judiciary Committee met in Manhattan today. They were, of course, led by Congressman Jim Jordan. And the hearing was on victims of violent crime in Manhattan. They are trying to look into, of course, how the DA over there, Alvin Bragg, has been, you know, he has these pro-crime anti-victim policies that have led to an increase in violent crime. And I would say a pretty dangerous community for New York City residents. There was complete chaos that broke out when protesters demanded to be let in. And Chairman Jim Jordan had to tell the witness section to be quiet multiple times due to a bunch of outbursts of applause during testimony. So pretty chaotic scene in there. And I want to play for you. Let's go first to Madeline Bream. This is a mother of a homicide victim as well as the chairman of the victim's rights reform council. She gave some pretty powerful testimony that detailed the death of her son and the failure of the New York judicial system. You know, I mean, they're spending a lot of time on very important things like making sure to get Donald Trump on whatever they can. Meanwhile, people's family members are actually dying in New York. And the DA seemingly doesn't want to do anything about it. Here is Madeline. All types of criminal elements. Free to do what they want, when they want, however they want, to whomever they want with no consequences, no deterrence, millions and billions of our hard earned tax dollars of going to fund these organizations that are doing absolutely nothing to deter this crime. I look forward, many of you. Can I respond to the police? Not right now because I only have 20 seconds. I'm sorry. But I do want to talk about my intelligence. Hang on, hang on, the gentlemen's time. I'm not going to get kind to insult me like I'm not aware of what's going on. Thank you. Okay. I'm fully aware of what's going on here. General A will suspend. Gentlemen gets another 15 seconds. Thank you. That's why I walked away from the plantation of the Democratic Party. We love to see it. Colonel's laughing. No, but she's right. Yeah. I mean, who who's been in charge of all these major urban population centers? I mean, we can look here in Dallas. We can look at Houston. We can look at Austin, where you just were. All of them. Look at what happened this weekend in Chicago. And the fact that you had the mayor of New York City get on television and say that New York City is one of the safest, largest cities in the United States of America. You got to be sucking delusional gas. I mean, I don't understand where they get these people, let these people get away with it. Or you have the incoming mayor of Chicago when he's looking at all these kids, we shouldn't demonize these kids to down there, you know, attacking, you know, visitors to the city and destroying businesses. So here's a woman that has lost her son. And you've got these Democrats in up there and trying to pat her on the head. And again, patronize her and saying, well, you just don't understand. Like hell, she doesn't understand. Your policies are killing kids in these intercity communities. But those black lives don't matter. They don't matter. So I want to, you mentioned all of the violence in Chicago. I know those of you who are watching, you just saw a little bit of it as the colonel was talking. But there was like over 100 teenagers that just just went on this violent rampage in downtown Chicago. Over the weekend, two teenage boys were shot, a ton of damages to as you can see, to cars and buildings, to vehicles and buildings. And of course, the new mayor over there, Brandon Johnson said that we shouldn't be demonizing the teenagers. He said he doesn't condone the destructive activity, but that their behavior was not completely their fault because they have been starved of opportunities in their own communities. So it's not their fault. It's always someone else's fault. They're just oppressed. And he says that they need to, the city needs to work together to create spaces for youth to gather safely and responsibly under adult guidance and supervision to ensure that every part of our city remains welcome for both residents and visitors. You know, it's just one small problem that in the city of Chicago alone, there are already over 19 different boys and girls clubs, for teens to play sports, gain access to tutors, adult supervision. They already have the spaces. They're just not going there because there is something very wrong with black culture in these communities. Can I, am I wrong? No, you're not wrong. And you're not racist for saying that. Okay. You know, I always get called a racist when I say it. Oh, no. Let me tell you what, the bottom line is that, and I'm saying to two white people, well, I'm just banning white. White pat, they call me, I'm white passing. White passing. Y'all got to stop allowing them to pigeonhole you. Okay. You know, you're not racist. You're just telling the truth. Like Donald Trump said, what have you got to lose? You are watching the destruction of the black community in these urban centers. And at some point in time, someone has to say enough of this, enough of that you all talking about your victims. Your schools suck. You know, you're not performing at a grade level on reading a math. You're going out there, you're destroying property, my private property. Let me tell you something. You come in my neighborhood like that, I'm going to shoot you. I don't care, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, whatever. You come in with disruptive behavior, you're going to shoot you. But the bottom line, the Democrats have destroyed the family unit. So when you talk about how those kids get out there, my dad would have beat my ass. If I said, you know, first of all, pull up your pants, put a belt on. But if I'm going to go out there and well, I'm going to go riot. Right. Boy, you're going to go get a book. That's what you're going to do. Right. So we did a lot when we were young. I mean, I've done a lot when I'm old, but I've done a lot in my life. But I tell you one thing that kept me out of a lot of trouble, and that was fear of my father. And you see a fatherless culture across the board, it's being at the senate. It's being incentivized financially by a democratic government. And, you know, I avoid cities. Now I hate going into them at this point. And again, there's just, it's gotten to a point where it's Democrat lawmakers who have created a culture where there's just nothing good going on in those cities. I was in Austin, I was telling you, and I'm walking down the street and it's the capital of Texas. And it's like zombie land. I'm stepping over people that are cranked out. And very affluent people and very nice clothes get out of their Mercedes Benz and just step over them like it's normal everyday behavior because let's keep Austin weird, right? And it's grieves my soul. And I go into these cities, you know, I've said when I go out to do live entertainment, I'm done with cities. I'm not going to big cities anymore. Done with it over with. They don't want me there anyway. So it's sad. It really is sad. I want to play, look, we're going to take a break, and then I want to come back and play Pete Buttigieg, transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg. Yeah. Well, yes, because he, Colonel, I think you in particular will be very interested in what he has to say. Buttigieg. Yes, about minorities and racial inequity. Little white A.G. Newman's going to tell me about the A.G. Yes, yes, I can't wait. All right, first, I want to remind you guys, nefarious, okay? It's a new movie. You got to go see it. It did really, really well the first week, but second week is crucial. So make sure if you have not seen it yet, you go see it. I know the poster. If you've seen the poster, it looks a little bit scary, but it's not a horror film. It's more like a psychological thriller. And it is, of course, based on a book written by the Blaze's own Steve Dase. So it's very intense. It's basically a story about a psychiatrist who's called into a prison to meet with a convicted killer who's about to be executed. And the killer says that he is a demon. Well, the psychiatrist who doesn't believe in God or demons has to decide if the man is insane, pretending to be insane, or, you know, I don't want to go too far. So I'm going to give it away. But the psychiatrist, little out of his depth, you guys have to go see it. I'm telling you, non-believers and believers, all of you, okay? If you go to church, bring a friend who maybe doesn't go to church. I have a feeling they might attend church with you after they see this movie. You can get your tickets now at whoisnafarious.com. Go get your tickets this week. It is whoisnafarious.com. I mentioned Pete Goodall, Pete Buttigieg, who is, you know, I know he had a long time for his paternity leave. It takes a lot to chestfeed when you're a man and can't lack it. He needed some extra time. He's sick. Got to work up to it. I'm going to be sick. That's what we do here, Colonel. And so he was talking to Al Sharpton about, of course, transportation, since he's a transportation secretary. And he actually said that, well, I street services, watch. We've got a crisis when it comes to roadway fatalities in America. We lose about 40,000 people every year. It's a level that's comparable to gun violence. And we see a lot of racial disparities, black and brown Americans, tribal citizens, and rural residents, much more likely to lose their lives, whether it's in a car or as a pedestrian being hit by a car. There are a lot of reasons related to discrimination, related to even the ways that roads are designed and built, who has access to a safe street design that's got crosswalks and good lighting, who doesn't have that access. That can drive disparities. And we have a responsibility to act on that. I feel like when you've lost Al Sharpton and you're arguing about how racist this country is, you've gone too far. You jumped this way. There's like two turtles having a discussion. They really do. If you are a pedestrian and you get hit by a car, that has nothing to do with race. Everything to do is stupidity. See car, you will lose to the car. Go across the street. I was driving through somewhere in the middle of nowhere, Texas, coming up to 81 a couple of weeks ago. It was 4.30 in the morning. And I was headed out on the road. This black guy in a motorized wheelchair decided to try to race me across the intersection. No. It was dark. And all of a sudden, I see something go. I thought it was a coyote. I thought something run across this deal. I bet I didn't miss him by six feet. I was close enough to see a skin color at 4.30 in the morning. And it was dark outside. And he was dark on his skin. As Pete says, black and brown people. I've never seen a black person. But anyway, I was like, I wasn't thinking. It wasn't racially motivated. You had hit him, Chad. It would have spiced up that conversation with him and Reverend Al. That would have been a hate crime. It's frustrating because when everything is racist, then nothing can be racist. And I feel like for instance. It becomes white noise. Can we use that right? Yes, you can. Right. Well, because for instance, when black lives matter, they first start talking about, hey, there are some inequities that we would like to address. And some of the issues you go, yes, actually that is a problem. There is random acts of racism that happen. I wouldn't argue that we have institutionalized racism. But I think that yes, we should be able to examine things. And when something is racist, we need to be able to call it out. But when streets are racist and trees are racist and weather is racist and COVID is racist and every single thing, every single issue is now racist. It's like, okay, well, now I've stopped listening. You know, there's a street in Dallas called Forest Lane. Now they said that that street was named after Nathan Bedford Forrest, you know, Confederate cavalry commander founded the Ku Klux Klan. I have driven down Forest Lane many times and I have never had anyone tell me get off of Forest Lane. Really? I have never had the ghost of Nathan Bedford Forrest. I said, you, black man, I was a general, you were just a colonel, get off of my street. And so what are they talking about? Some of the worst streets around here are in the city of Dallas. Who's the mayor of Dallas? Eric Johnson, a black guy. So, I would also argue it's constantly under construction as well. So they're, I mean, they're constantly updating it. So what gives you? See, you're absolutely right. If everything is racist, nothing is racist. The most systemically racist people in the United States of America belong to the Democrat Party. The party of slavery, the party of secession, the party of segregation, now the party of socialism, the party of the soft bigotry of low expectations, that's who they are. And so really they're deflecting, you know, who they are upon us. And Colonel, you and I both are well traveled sons of the south. Yes, we are Georgia boys. The most racist place you can go in America today is the north. It is of the United States. Yeah. And I promise you, with the south gets blamed all the time, we grew up with each other. Look at the boroughs of New York. Right. Right. We grew up together. I mean, I always tell people, I said, you know, I never crossed my mind. I, you know, I can remember my friend in fifth grade, fourth grade Bernard Kelly. I want him to come over and spend the night, you know, and I didn't think you think about that. I didn't think about the color of his skin or anything else. I just, that was my buddy as my friend, you know. I can remember my friend at University of Georgia, Sam Joseph, he was a soccer player there and I remember he'd come home with me every weekend. We didn't think about it. You know, I traveled with, as a baseball player, I slept, you know, four grown-ass dudes in two double beds on a hotel room traveling all over playing baseball. We didn't think about those things. Now, I'm not saying that, you know, Jim Crow south didn't exist, but we, our parents worked to move us through all of that stuff. And then you got these bigots in the north that did not live like that, who look at it almost like they're staring at a weird fish in an aquarium and judging it. And it's like, you guys are the worst, most judgmental people of all who brought us Jim Crow. Last word. The Democrats. The Democrats. Well, it always comes back to the Democrats when it has to do with race. All right, we got to take a break. We'll be back. Always. A YouTuber Kyle Forgier took his dog to the vet, hoping to receive a sex change, but was abruptly told to leave the office and yes, this is a parody. It's hilarious. Watch. We want to do like a gender transition to the new people. We don't want to do it. So we're just filming a documentary for his transnational. That was pretty cool. Yeah, those are the expressions. We explained you so basically like, right. But every time if we put them, if we put it to two, two in front of them, he'll put it on right away. We're not a behavioral. I wouldn't call that behavior. We were saying gender identity is behavioralism. I want you to need this. My property, I got to leave the privacy. Okay. I'm going to try to pronounce passing if you continue to delete. You're going to start. We can't do a gender. I'm just telling you, you gotta leave the property. I'm reporting this to the LGBTQ plus minus two. That's so good. It's so, but you left so you don't cry, that we're in a place where some people might think that that was real. Because there are probably people who would like to do that to their dogs. The dog decided they wanted that. Exactly. Thank you guys for being here."
