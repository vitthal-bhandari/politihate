    "text": " Today on the mat wall show the ruling class got together at the Met Gala last night to celebrate their wealth. AOC was on the scene in a tax the rich dress. Was it a courageous and rebellious display by the congresswoman or was it rank shameless hypocrisy? We'll discuss also a new poll shows that an increasing number of vaccinated Americans are cutting off ties with unvaccinated friends. Plus Secretary of State Blinken admits that many of those SIV applicant Afghans were admitting it to the country are not actually SIV applicants at all and a male MMA fighter enters the ring with a female fighter and then proceeds to beat her into submission. This is being celebrated as a brave and beautiful moment in sports history but I have a different take as you might expect all of that and more today on the mat wall show. You know one of my great struggles in life is that I am extremely forgetful and this is a problem when traveling as you know I've talked about traveling the last couple weeks. I always forget at least five important things and most recently traveling for the last two weeks I forgot my relief band and I paid the consequences because we were taking a lot of you know ubers and everything around a lot of a lot of a lot of stop and starts and going around cities and lots of unpaved roads in New York City because I guess they've decided that paving is you know just not not worth the time and and I was feeling pretty motion sick and I wish that I had had my relief band because relief band is the number one FDA cleared anti-nausea wristband that has been clinically proven to quickly relieve and effectively prevent nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness anxiety migraine hangover morning sickness chemotherapy and so much more the product is 100% drug free non-drowsy and provides all natural relief with zero side effects for as long as you need and it really does work I can tell you that myself so ensure that nausea is never the reason to miss out on life's important moments right now relief band has an exclusive offer just for mat wall listeners if you go to reliefband.com and use promo code wall you'll receive 20% off plus free shipping and a no questions asked three day money back guarantee so head to r-e-l-i-e-f-b-a-n-d dot com and use our promo code Walsh for 20% off AOC's abuela as far as we know is still languishing in her unfurnished Puerto Rican shack with water pouring from the ceiling and collecting in 10 buckets strewn across the floor infamously the congresswoman would not allow me to step in and rescue the poor woman from her dire situation and I can tell you that I am still personally haunted by that I I still wake up at some nights in a cold sweat shouting abuela I'm sorry I tried abuela AOC one can assume has swept slept like a baby this entire time on the other hand I bring this up again because I thought about abuela last night when I saw the picture circulating online of her negligent granddaughter cavorting with her fellow rich people at the Met Gala in New York tickets for the opulent event cost somewhere around $30,000 a piece and if you want to buy a table inside the hall to advertise your brand somebody keep in mind for next year if you're thinking about this for your business it'll run you about a quarter of a million dollars so it is a garish extravaganza the ostensible purpose of which is to raise money for the Metropolitan Museum of Art but in actuality the point is to celebrate and revel in the ostentatious wealth of the Hollywood government and media elites in attendance now it may seem rather hypocritical for AOC to show up at this carnival of affluence but don't worry the expensive designer dress she donned for the occasion which appears to have been inspired by a Chick-fil-A takeout bag had the words tax the rich scrawled across it those words change everything we're supposed to believe normally it would be hypocritical for a woman who constantly rants about rich people to attend a lavish ball with rich people so that she could rub elbows with those same rich people but in this case we're told her attendance is a bold and brave and rebellious statement all because of those words on her dress here she is explaining her fashion choice my gut tax the rich what a model AOC I didn't know you model as well damn when or and I were first kind of partnered uh we really started having a conversation about what it means to be working class women of color at the Met and we said you know we can't just play along but we need to break the fourth wall and challenge some of the institutions and and you know while the Met is known for its its spectacle we should have a conversation about it yeah uh yeah have a conversation now here's a general rule any time somebody justifies a particular action that they've taken by claiming that they've done it because they want to start a conversation it means 100 percent of the time that they're full of s that's what it means case in point later that night on twitter AOC further defended her attendance saying quote proud to work with Aurora James as a sustainable focused black woman immigrant designer who went from starting her dream at a flea market in Brooklyn to winning the CFDA against all odds and then work together to kick the doors open at the Met the time is now for child care health care and climate action for all tax the rich quick quick fact check on some of this Aurora James the immigrant woman in AOC's phrase is from Ontario now she may technically be an immigrant but a fashion designer moving a few hundred miles from Canada to New York isn't exactly the picture that AOC wants us to have in mind when she uses the phrase black immigrant woman also when she says kick the doors open at the Met what she means is that she took pictures on the red carpet and then drank cocktails with her rich friends that's kicking the doors open not exactly Jesus overturning the tables and driving the money changers away with a whip if she had done that's totally different story and when she says child care and health care keep in mind that health care for children as far as the congresswoman is concerned can often include crushing their skulls and throwing them into a medical waste dumpster so other than those minor details I'd say the her description was a pretty accurate now with that established I think there are a few other more general points to be made here first the problem let's talk about this tax the rich slogan for a second the problem is that the slogan is uh you know it seems to suggest that the rich right now are not taxed that's why you say tax the rich because according to you they're not if they were being taxed then the slogan wouldn't make sense it'd be redundant but that's not true the rich pay taxes they pay lots of taxes they pay the most taxes they pay the vast majority of taxes tax the rich sure I agree of course we should tax the rich yeah I don't think there are very many people saying that we shouldn't tax the rich at all so here's the good news we do a lot that's a fact if you hear that the rich don't pay taxes and you believe it that must mean that you first of all don't read very much and aren't in the habit of researching claims made by partisans before deciding to believe them it also means presumably that you don't make much money yourself because if you've ever had the experience of making a small amount of money and then managing to climb up the ladder aways I'm not talking about all the way up to Elon Musk level I just mean you made a little bit of money and then you had some more success and you made some more money if you've ever done that and achieved greater financial success relative to where you began you'll have noticed that as you earn more money the government takes more money from you it's a pretty uh inescapable thing it's it's it's pretty obvious and at a certain point you'll observe with alarm they begin to take so much of your income that you question whether the climb was worth it to begin with that's the case right now this may come as a shock to anybody who previously believed that the government rewards higher income earners by politely declining to harvest their income but that's not the case it's not even close to the case as it turns out the government quite enjoys taking people's money and the more money you have the more you'll want to stick its greasy hands into your pockets and when Joe Biden is running the government the hand may even linger there in your pocket for an uncomfortable and unnecessary length of time so considering that the rich pay most of the taxes vast vast majority of the taxes are paid by the rich where did this idea come from that they pay no taxes well here's a good example of how the propaganda works this is a CBS news headline from back in june it says quote is it just the headline says richest 25 americans have a true tax rate of almost nothing wow almost nothing almost nothing what that doesn't sound fair jeff bezos doesn't he pays almost nothing i mean what what is that all about well let's read on it says the u.s tax system is designed to be progressive meaning that the wealthiest citizens pay a greater share of their income than the less fortunate but a new pro-publical analysis of tax data on some of the nation's richest americans comes to the conclusion that the richest 25 people in the u.s. have a true tax rate of almost nothing the pro-publica report focuses on what it calls the true tax rate which it defines is how much in taxes were paid by the wealthiest americans annually versus the estimated growth in their wealth during that time for instance amazon CEO jeff bezos paid 1.4 billion dollars in personal federal taxes between 2006 and 2018 on 6.5 billion that he reported in income while his wealth increased by 127 billion during that same period by pro-publica's calculation that reflects a true tax rate of 1.1 percent but some continuing but some tax experts noted that the analysis compares what they say are apples to oranges income versus wealth the irs collects taxes on earned income and income received through stock sales dividends and other income provided by investments it doesn't levy taxes on unrealized gains or the paper value of a person's assets ah okay there it is when they say that jeff bezos pays almost nothing what they mean is that he paid 1.4 billion dollars nothing 1.4 billion is almost nothing they justify this claim through a little slight of hand trick where they equate they equate net worth with income those two things are not the same and it's a damn good thing that the federal government doesn't tax your net worth like it taxes your income because that would be a disaster for anyone who has any kind of net worth at all can you imagine that if that's what you were doing at the at income tax time you would assess not only your your income for the year but your entire net worth and pay on that of course many of the people in the peanut gallery not to be confused with the elites like ao see who shout tax the rich don't have any net worth have never owned anything and so these are distinctions and points that go over their head now I say all this but it's not because I care deeply about protecting jeff bezos from higher tax rates frankly I don't care if his taxes go up a little bit it doesn't doesn't bother me my main problem with raising taxes on anyone is that the government already rakes in three or four trillion dollars a year in tax revenue and squanders almost all of it you know I think it's like it's a three and a half trillion I think they're up to it maybe more that they bring in in tax revenue every single year and yet there are people saying they need more to do what with what problem can the government solve potentially that they can't already solve with three trillion dollars a year there is no problem that can be solved by giving even more money to this giant lumbering corrupt wasteful behemoth raises taxes if you want whatever but just just know that it will solve nothing and that the policy is being pushed based on lies and bad faith arguments and it's being believed by idiots who don't understand the first thing about how the economy works and don't even understand the distinction between income and net worth second point why do you think that the rich love aoc why do they love the tax the rich slogan you know showing up to the Met Gala in a tax the rich dress that's not like if I showed up to a Planned Parenthood fundraiser in in a in a t-shirt that said in prison abortionists which actually sounds like a great thing to do maybe I'll do that but aoc you know she was embraced and applauded if I did that I'd be assaulted by security and thrown out into the street the rich are fine with the tax the rich stuff because many of them really don't mind paying a bit more in taxes that's not because they're generous I mean if they were generous they'd be forgoing they'd forgo the two hundred thousand dollar designer outfit and the expensive costume ball and donate that extra wealth to the poor if you're wondering that I mean all these rich people say oh yeah taxes we should be paying more they say while wearing an outfit that costs more than your house they could just give up one outfit in their wardrobe and they could put you know a family of five in a home and they choose not to do that no they they go along with the tax the rich stuff and they call for higher taxes themselves because for one thing it's an easy and relatively cheap way to virtue signal and more importantly it gets them closer to the levers of power so what are the what do all of the people at the Met Gala having common they're all in the ruling class AOC the other politicians in attendance the Hollywood degenerates who are there all of them are in the ruling class together they have a shared interest they have shared goals and that is mainly to maintain and extend their own influence sure they'll pay a little more in taxes what do they care they know those taxes are being spent by their comrades to advance their own ideological interests anyway and their own financial interests so for them for the people at the Met Gala or the people who were at the VMAs the night before big big week for Hollywood degenerates by the way they could bring it break out all their ugly costumes but for those people paying taxes that's an investment for them they get something in return for it I mean they get an entire system an entire political system that works at their best that's what they get in return that's why our objective shouldn't be simply to tax the rich but rather to dethrone the ruling class you'll notice AOC she didn't put that on her dress because that's the last thing she wants to do third point finally the rich also aren't too worried about AOC's tax the rich slogan airing because they know it isn't serious anyway she wasn't the only one who showed up last night with bumper sticker jargon emblazoned on her outfit there are plenty of you know celebrities wearing gaudy but basically non-political outfits like Nas little Nas X was there he could be seen here dressed like a C3PO's gay cousin but there was also Cara della vignier whoever that is wearing what looks to be a fake bulletproof vest with um peg the patriarchy written on it and then carolyn b. Maloney whoever that is with equal rights for women prints it on a robe that looks like something that a lesbian episcopal bishop might wear and then Megan Rapunoe with a handbag featuring the words in gay we trust you know the other thing you see in all these pictures are the wide-eyed starstruck reporters in the background wearing face masks and hungrily snapping pictures now the celebrities they're not wearing face masks that's actually the greatest hypocrisy on display in this entire thing none of them are wearing face masks why aren't they wearing face masks because that would ruin their outfits because it wouldn't look as nice and it's true that you look ridiculous in a face mask everybody does so it's one of the many reasons why i don't wear them but all the reporters so so the uh the you know the the servants are all wearing masks and the reporters who are also servants for the for the ruling class they're all in masks AOC not wearing a mask none of the rest of them are wearing masks this is really the whole thing in a nutshell isn't it because truly nothing says modern left ism like a gaggle of rich elitists at a thirty thousand dollar per ticket gala walking around in hideous designer dresses with shallow political slogans and blazing across them while an adoring press looks on drooling into their muzzles it's all empty they're all just cosplaying as political revolutionaries none of them care about any of these issues none of them believe in anything but their own power and their own influence and last night was the perfect illustration of that fact let's get now to our five headlines now a quick word from our friends over at mac weldon you know i've become something of a fashion designer myself recently with the sweet uh sweet baby gang t-shirts and i

think about abuela regularly and i wonder how she's doing however she's doing she's not as doing doing nearly as well as her as her granddaughter i think that could be said for sure let's start with this secretary of state blincoln testified before congress about the efforts to you know get americans out of afghanistan and to bring afghans into this country because right now everything is kind of uh on its head right we've got americans in afghanistan we're bringing afghan we're bringing afghans to america while leaving americans there everything is is upside down and backwards and topsy turvy but here is we'll start with a couple of clips here this is secretary of state blincoln during his testimony um when he was asked how many of the afghans that we brought here do not meet the requirements for special immigrant visas because we've been told that these are all siv applicants special immigrant visas and uh and many of them are translators we apparently had a lot of translators in uh in afghanistan who who knew it was only whether we had 2,500 troops there and apparently like a hundred thousand translators every every uh american service member in afghanistan had a whole team of translators just surrounding him everywhere he went it would seem and blincoln was asked about this and here's what he said hey we're there to help american get out how many afghans not meeting the qualifications of siv have been brought to the united states prior to i want to know how many afghan citizens came to the united states that had not met the qualifications for special immigrant visa we're in the process of going through how many how many how many did you bring you were just at dollars how many did you bring but we have we will have by the end of the month we will have brought a total of approximately 60,000 that have not met the siv process some of those will be some of those will have been through the siv process all of the regardless of siv status will have gone through rigorous security checks first at the transit point outside it'd be nice if that was done before we brought these people the united states of america so he said he won't answer the question he said 60,000 total and he was not going to say how many of them actually meet the requirements versus how many don't and the actual answer that he won't give is well we don't care what do we care about that that's not our concern you know if we make them citizens well they vote democrat that's that's one requirement we're worried about that but other than that who cares here's something that he does care about that is the lgbt community in afghanistan he says he's very focused on on the the fate of the lgbt community let's watch as you know mr secretary the lgbt qi community in afghanistan is extremely vulnerable to punitive actions from the taliban it's important in my view that we take steps to ensure that those who would be subjected to violence or worse because of their sexual orientation or gender identity are safe the council of a global equality the human rights campaign at lgbtqi plus refugee support groups released a 10 point plan to protect afghan lgbtqi refugees my question is have you seen this plan and if so is the administration prepared to implement it and is it consistent with the presidential mama random of early 2021 that speaks of the responsibility to help afghan refugees that make it to neighboring states is outlined in that mammarandom well thank you for very rightly putting the spotlight on concerns about the lgbtqi plus in afghanistan in the particular threat that they may find themselves under this is something that we are focused on i have not personally seen the report that you referred to i'm going to ask to see it i'm pretty sure that my my team has but i'll take a look at that myself and i thank you for sending it to us i know this is not even really the point uh i mean there is no point to anything that this empty-headed moron says in the first place but lgbtqi plus you know yes yes get the whole act it's not that's not even close to the whole acronym but you know the i stands for intersex so you know part of the concern is uh is is uh we're focused on the fate of intersex people in afghanistan is that is is that like a major concern of the u.s government intersex people afghanistan the fact that the eye gets included at all but there's nothing to do you know being intersex is a is a it's a medical condition that that has to do with the uh with the appearance of your genitals you know it's a it's a burst defect it's a it's a deformity it's a genetic mutation and the way that we we put them in the lgbt it's got nothing to do with it at all it's not a lifestyle choice it's not a sexual orientation it's not gender identity you know i i often wonder how it intersects people feel about being included of course you don't hear from them very often because there are very few of them this is a very very thankfully a very very rare condition um but even so if if that if if i had that condition i'm not sure i'd be a fan of just being appropriated in this way talk about appropriation and being lumped in with some group that why am i part of that group well the answer is the reason why there i'm asking all this rhetorically i know the answer the answer is that intersex people are useful to trans people and like we talked about yesterday trans people the top of the of the victimhood pyramid and whatever they say goes and so if if you're intersex and trans people say well we we need you on our team what do you mean i don't want to be on your team i'm not i'm just this is a medical condition doesn't matter we need you here get over here because of the of this false equivalency that they can draw that's what you get on the left they they can never argue about the actual point you know they got to go all the way to the rare cases that have nothing to do with the main point so you talk to anyone on the left about transgenderism within 10 seconds they're going to be bringing up intersex people which is an entirely different category that has nothing to do at all with a biological male who identifies as a woman the fact that some people have genetic defects that affect the the appearance of the genitals says nothing at all about transgenderism whether it's valid or invalid if i'm a biological male fully biological male identifying as a woman and you say to me well how can you be a woman doesn't make any sense for me to say well but look at these people over here they have a genetic they have a medical condition yeah but do you have that medical condition no i don't but they do and you know so that means that i'm what all right but what were we even talking about oh yeah um intersex afghans okay let's move on to the next topic here from the new york post it's the ultimate form of social distancing it says one in seven vaccinated americans have ditched pals who've refused to get the cove in 19 vaccine according to a new poll the one poll survey from monday found 16 percent of respondents have broken up with at least three friends since the pandemic began in march 2020 of those who ended friendships 66 percent were vaccinated and 17 percent have no plans to receive the shot about one in seven or fourteen percent of those have been vaccinated said they dumped their friends because of their refusal to get jabbed a vast majority of vaccinated respondents 97 percent believe their former friends are full-blown anti-vaxxers who couldn't be convinced of the importance of getting the life-saving shot and well i we need some of the words being used here don't really work because you say they ended their friendships there was never a friendship to begin with so that's one thing you can be pretty sure of if you have a friend who won't speak to you now who's broken up with you i don't know how a friend breakup works in the first place where you're just friends with someone but do you actually call them up and say i got a breakup with you I could see maybe that's something women would do tending to be a little bit more dramatic about these things no offense i certainly hope men aren't doing this are there dudes calling up their buddies hey man listen we got a breakup what great god what are you talking about i can't see anymore you you want i got this substance injected into my body and you won't get it injected into yours and uh you know i wanted to be vaccine buddies with you i wanted to share the same substance coursing through our veins but you won't so i can't see you how bizarre that was never a friend so you don't have to worry about that as if any if any friend has broken up with you um first of all to begin with that means that they're lame and corny and who wants to be around them anyway but that was never a real friendship and of course it goes back to the same contradiction because one of the things that drives people to uh break up with their friends or alienate their family members not want to be around their family members and their friends who aren't vaccinated one of the things that drives that is that they who are the vaccinated people feel that uh they're the it would be unsafe that their health would be jeopardized if the other people around them don't also have the vaccine so their message is and i've been trying to distill this down to to something very simple to understand their mentality and i think this is it this is their message this is what they're saying the vaccinated people who are you know not wanting to be around unvaccinated people they're saying you must get the vaccine to protect me because i got the vaccine and i don't trust it to protect me i got the vaccine and i've decided it doesn't protect me and so you have to get the vaccine to protect me that's what they're saying there are a couple levels of contradiction there which make no sense at all and the first problem is this whole idea that it's someone else's responsibility to make a medical decision for their body for your sake the idea that they have to make a medical decision forget about whether it's the right medical decision or not doesn't matter you're saying they have to make a medical decision about their own bodies for you how selfish could you possibly be and on top of that you you apparently don't trust the vaccine to protect you anyway so why should they do it when you say to someone oh get the vaccine to protect me what they should respond is get the hell out of my face you weirdo and if they don't want if they don't want to be that rude then they could say well don't you have the vaccine well yeah i have it and does it protect you uh no so why do i have to do it there's no way around this they can't get around it so they so they simply ignore it and you could say all you want well yeah but it's layers of protection and yeah the vaccine works to protect you when you take it yourself but if someone else gets it then you're even more protected okay fine so let me i'll add the word significant into it does the vaccine offer significant protection or not and if you tell me no then i don't see how we could require or demand that anyone put a drug in their bodies that doesn't offer them significant protection if you say yes then you're significantly protected get over it just move on with your life i mean that's the most you can ask for in life the most you can ask for and even sometimes this is too much to ask or depending on what the risk is but the most you can ask for in life is that you are that you you you take precautions that significantly protect you against uh very various forms of harm there is no absolute protection the best you'll ever get when it comes to protection against harm of any kind is significant and sometimes with some forms of harm you won't even get that this is from the daily why it says students in New York City's public schools return to 100 percent in-person learning for the first time since schools began remote only in march 2020 but as multiple parents and outlets report in person does not mean a return to normal and may end up harming students just as much as remote learning did uh carol marco is a new york times marco which i think new york post columnist with children and nyc's public schools reported the harsh conditions kids face in the new school year uh she said my daughter's man hat in middle school won't be using lockers this year my son's brooklyn elementary school let us know that water fountains will remain closed no group projects no field trips no parties outdoor resource s will be masked and distanced forget tag or sports this word is way overused but how dystopian is this really the image of masked children outside during recess who can't come within six feet of other kids what are you gonna draw circles on the ground on in the grass stand in your circle give them a ball they can just throw it up in the air themselves you catch a kid throwing a ball to another kid grab the ball disinfect it put the two kids in detention in separate classes that what we're doing yeah that is that's what we're doing uh she pointed to a health guide from new york's education department which suggested schools cancel sports theater clubs and all music related activities because children might breathe too much during them uh the guide states quote due to increased exhalation oh it literally says that okay it actually says don't do activities where kids will do too much breathing exorbitant breathing is a is a is a real problem now maybe that's something kids will get detention for get them suspended write that on the slip too much breathing you know you know we should do we should assign we should tell kids this is how many breaths you're allowed to take in school so let's figure out this this is what we need to do for the sake of the kids and for safety let's figure out um average school day let's say seven hours how many breaths will a kid typically take i don't know how many breaths it is but you know i don't know and we'll figure out what the average is you give them leeway of like five or six extra gasps and beyond that no bream we're gonna count the breaths go beyond that it's gonna be serious consequences the guide states due to increased exhalation that occurs during physical activity some sports can put players coaches trainers and others at increased risk for getting and spreading covid-19 close contact sports and indoor sports are particularly risky similar risks might exist for other extracurricular activities such as band choir theater and school clubs that meet indoors does it actually put people at a greater risk do you have any science for that any data have there been any studies we have any statistics of those or any are there any numbers you can show us because kids playing physical close contact sports like tag or whatever football basketball i mean all sports almost are are certainly physical at a minimum so is there any data that shows us has there been an example anywhere in the world of kids playing a sport outside and there being a covid outbreak because of it has there been any super spreader dodge ball game attended dot then again they're not allowed to play dodge ball in school anyway that that went away a long time ago um mark which wrote that one man had an elementary school sent parents a survey asking what they should do in case of inclement weather one of the options was actually skip lunch so they have to eat lunch outside and they'll sit on the ground some schools have forbidden students from talking during lunch and if it's raining or something then they're gonna say well you're just not gonna have lunch because that's healthier make the kids go all day that's the healthiest thing to have kids wearing the face muzzle all day breathing in their own sweat and dirt and grime and don't look and eat either on twitter she noted that students will have to fill out a health form each morning before school which asks if they're experiencing any symptoms of covid and you know the problem with with that i mean of all of these uh regulations which are all insane maybe if you don't think very much about it the one that might sound the most reasonable is uh fill out a form and make sure you don't have covid symptoms we could all agree that if a kid actually has covid he shouldn't go to school um and he was just like if there's any other respiratory virus he shouldn't go to school he has a flu we shouldn't go to school but you think about what the symptoms of covid are the symptoms are headache uh fatigue runny nose slight cough the symptoms are anything the symptoms are anything other than feeling perfect if you're feeling anything less than absolutely perfect in this moment you have covid symptoms and what that means is that kids either are going to have to just get in the habit of lying on the form or they're going to get sent home every single day so speaking of preparing classrooms for covid the sc i u uh union tweeted a video of their covid buster unit preparing schools this is also in new york and let's play this here they are preparing the uh this looks like a you know some kind of first grade or second grade classroom preparing the uh the classroom for for you know kids coming what is he doing right now does he even know what he's doing looks like he's just spraying pesticide into the air it would not surprise me if that's what they're doing you have kids dropping dead from pesticide sprayed in the air that's not actually what they're doing youtube don't don't ban me uh well i don't know they're they're pranks they're spraying some sort of disinfectant in the air it was gonna accomplish absolutely nothing but it's all part of this um one of the real diseases in our culture right now the do the do something disease that's what all of this is about well do do do something anything at all and so what you find in school is that they're doing a lot of something they're just doing things uh ostensibly in response to covid none of it will have any positive health effect at all none none of it will prevent covid you still see now uh even outside the classroom and i saw a lot of this traveling around the country uh is a little bit less of it here in Nashville but in other cities you go to a store the cashier is in is encased in glass like Hannibal Lecter we already know that doesn't do anything that doesn't stop the spread of covid if anything it makes it worse because now you've got an extra surface that can get uh dirty and and and also it restricts the the flow of air and you and and circulation of air you want greater air circulation you know putting more obstacles in place restricting air flow and we know that and yet they just continue to do it because it's something all right let's move on now to reading the youtube comments uh andrew clavin i believe this is an imposter says matt i agreed when you warned against republicans using genera to call dems transphobes while we're the real inclusive inclusive inclusive this there's a word how is that different from saying the licentious vma's are old hat while conservatives are the real revolutionaries in both cases an arbitrary third value inclusivity or rebelliousness is claimed as a way to elevate our standing and in both cases it distracts from our true values and motivations please don't ban me well i would never ban the real angel claim from the show but you the imposter our band served because um first of all i'm not proposing rebelliousness as a value i'm observing the fact that um that this debauchery is meant to be rebellious and instead it is tired and dreary and boring and i think that's a worthwhile point to make um because it is it is sold as as something exciting and different and and and kids are told this you listen to this music and behave this certain way that you're going to be you know taking down the system tearing down the patriarchy like the woman had on her dress at the met gala in reality this is the system you're doing exactly as you're told you're doing exactly as the people in charge people in positions of power want you to do and also it's dull and dreary and boring like i said so i i think that's an important point and second um you know so-called traditional values are revolutionary and rebellious in our age that is another statement of fact that i think it's an important one that doesn't make them right of course so i take your point there and it's not like that's my sole argument in favor of them i'm not saying that's the only thing that we should be saying in favor of so-called traditional values it is again an observation but it is also true that young people have a natural yearning to rebel against the standing order and i think that uh in this case that is something worth harnessing it's not all you know it can be harnessed in negative ways certainly but it's a way of taking what can be a positive attribute and inclination and instinct and directing it towards positive ends well we we do that a lot with kids on a day-to-day basis just as parents we do that that is so much of parenting that's so much of raising the next generation is taking all of this excitement and enthusiasm that that kids naturally have and you know you don't want to simply tamp it down you don't want to drug them into submission like they do in schools but you also want to make sure you harness it in the in in the correct way that's so much of parenting and i think that that's part of what i'm talking about here all right let's see username person says matt just so you know many people in the black community are against lil naz exes antics they're trying to push this stuff on the black community and many are pushing back but it doesn't get media attention yeah this is this is something that that i often hear i mean traditionally and by the way unfortunately you are banned for the uncreative username i mean put a little more effort that you know that i'm bringing the comments on air and you go with person so you can make another username and come back but as to your point yeah this is something traditionally it's been it's been thought that you know the black community immigrant communities you know the spanish community tend to be more culturally conservative certainly more so than you know your white liberal yuppies and yet black community and immigrant communities by and large vote democrat and so there is that that real disconnect there all right let's see what else we got as we were talking about cities so this is one you know i was saying i can't imagine how anyone would choose to live in the city and a lot of comments about that i'll read one representative comment here this is from joe snider says i live in nyc and i can attest that your description of our lifestyle even as a tourist is accurate we used to have an incredible amount of culture and artistry that helped offset the side you're describing and for a couple of decades we've gotten our crime under control but with covid and de Blasio slash modern day left is them now it's just an expensive yurd smelling crime-ridden sh**hole yeah and there were other comments so there's a lot of comments saying that saying yeah this is exactly what it's like in new york and many of these other cities los angeles san francisco and you know phil delphi of altima on and on um a lot of comments like that other comments saying well hey you're telling people to get out of the cities and that means that we're abandoning the cities to this fate shouldn't we stay in there and fight to turn it around i guess my answer to that would be first of all you have to make whatever choice you think is right for you but if you're a single person um and you feel like you want to stay in the city environment partly for this reason to be a shining light in the darkness it's not a choice i would make but i can respect that choice i think though if you have kids you know if you're a family and i get that there are many people living in cities right now with families and they'd like to leave but they can't so i understand that but if you have kids if you have a family and there's an opportunity to leave and you're able to then uh then i think you have to it sort it's the same thing i say with public schools it's one thing if you want to fight if you want to put yourself sort of behind enemy lines and and you you want to subject yourself to that but you're also asking your kids and in public schools your kids are the only ones doing the fighting which is why if there's an option to get them out i think i think you got to and it's the same thing with with the cities it's also i'm afraid to say probably losing battle the corruption and the rot and the decay in many of our cities is so deep and has been building for so long that you know you stay there to try to turn it around i don't know that you're going to be able to turn it around before it destroys you so that's the real thing you have to grapple with but thanks for all those comments there is no issue more pressing than the blatant authoritarianism being exercised by the current administration vaccine mandates are unamerican and the antithesis of freedom it's wrong it's affecting all of us and we're ready to talk about it tonight that's why you should tune in to catch an all new episode of uh backstage where we will discuss what's happening and how we fight against it um that's going to be of course you know backstage like every episode myself Ben Shapiro Jeremy Boring Michael Knowles and Andrew Clavin with a really important issue to discuss tonight it streams tonight at seven o'clock eastern six p.m. central on dailywire.com and on our youtube channel dailywire you don't want to miss it believe me you also don't want to miss the new sweet baby gang t-shirts which will couple well with the new sweet baby gang anthem that you can now hear on the show every day as expected the t-shirts are selling out fast so you got to click the link in the description to go order yours today it is a masterpiece of design i finally have uh i had to you know i actually had to ask to get my own tip i finally have the t-shirt here myself and i should be wearing it maybe i'll wear it to tomorrow on the show but that is that's the official sweet baby gang t-shirt um if you haven't gotten it yet i know who you are i'm keeping track of everybody who claims to be a gang member and has not gotten that t-shirt and you don't want to know what the consequences are because there are none but still go get uh the t-shirt today click the link the link in the description get your sweet baby game t-shirt now let's get to our daily cancellation today for our daily cancellation we turn to the story of nma fighter and woman beater alana mclaughlin now the most important thing to know about mclaughlin is that he is a male he's also former army special forces but mostly he's a male and when i say he's a male i mean he has xy chromosomes and a male reproductive system and male gametes so it makes a person a male he also has a male bone structure muscle structure he's male from head to toe from skin to bone from his brain down to his cells down to his dna literally every part of him is male if they dig up his remains a hundred years from now no matter how much of him is left they will be able to tell that he was male that will indeed be one of the only things they will be able to tell about him that's because your maleness or your femaleness is one of the most ingrained the most permanent most enduring aspects of who you are it's so enduring that it remains even after you die mclaughlin will be a male even when he doesn't exist anymore that's how male he is think about that if you're a man even when you stop existing you'll still be a man and yet that didn't stop him from fighting a woman in the mma ring during the combat global pre-limbs on friday night mclaughlin fought and easily defeated sellene provost another mma fighter to be more specific after beating her across the head and the body for a couple of rounds he eventually got her into a submission hold and choked her out this was again a man beating the crab out of a woman and event that in the past would have been roundly condemned by everybody when former ravens running back ray rice punched his wife in an elevator it was one of the biggest sports scandals in nfl history and rice was run out of the league never to return now we know that rice could have simply come out the day out the day that the security camera footage was leaked could have come out and said um said that he's a woman asked everyone to call him regina rice from now on it's bad for ray to be to beat a woman but regina now that's a different story that's why alana mclaughlin is being celebrated as a as a hero today after choking a woman in submission but mclaughlin is not the one i'm canceling today yeah he's a cheater a woman beater a bad person for that reason it's also a pathological narcissist yes he's a he's a male who beat a woman to a pulp and who identified phalan fox as his hero phalan fox as the other trans mma mma fighter who retired a few years ago who twice fractured a woman's skull and then bragged about it so yes all of that is true and all of that is worthy of cancellation to be sure but as always the bad guys discussed to me somewhat less than the cowards who knowingly go along with the evil because they're too scared and too selfish to speak out and the announcers and commentators during this farcical fight on friday night give us a pretty good idea of what that cowardice sounds like so let's go through some of these clips first here is one of the hosts before the fight introducing alana mclaughlin and a very very gingerly acknowledging that maybe some people in the viewing audience might have a problem with watching a man kick and punch a woman for ten minutes listen back here i'm combate global with rudolfo roman my name is max bretos and alana mclaughlin will be fighting here tonight and the topic of trans athletes competing obviously splinters the conversation quite frequently however whatever side you think about and whether you think that the trans athletes should compete one thing we can all agree on the sacrifices one has to make to make that decision is bigger than anything any of us would do on a regular basis alana mclaughlin has had to overcome many hurdles in her life and her career it's a journey that only her have taken let's take a closer look at some of those sacrifices that she has had to make so early as i knew there was a difference between girls and boys i knew that something was different i grew up mostly in south carolina my upbringing was not exactly standard it wasn't usual my parents go to church five times a week wasn't the best childhood we didn't have a lot of money and of course growing up a queer kid in the south it was never going to be easy my family definitely was not supportive and are not today his family is not supportive well that's good news at least the only guy we says uh my my upbringing was uh now it's pretty rough not usual my family went to church that's all he has that's that's his only that's his horror story of being raised man i had a pretty tough kid family went to church yep that was it now i can tell you that i certainly would not be supportive of my son getting into the ring with women and choking them on national television that's not something that i would support to put it mildly and yet the announcer says that um we can all agree that the sacrifices made by a male who beats up a woman are bigger than any of the sacrifices that any of us have ever made have ever made we can all agree he says and what he means of course is that we must we must all agree we are required to agree just as his employer told him that he must agree that's why his facial expression and his stuttering stammering delivery reminds you of a hostage tape this guy knows how hopelessly screwed up all of this is but he's cooperating with the charade and that brings us to the fight itself speaking of the charade fast forwarding a little bit to where the foregone conclusion is realized and the man beats the woman let's listen to the announcers as they very carefully wrestle with the implications of the spectacle that they themselves are now a part of big right hand i for one and i just fooled transparency i don't know what to expect i don't know how to feel about this but i pull for a lot of maglop because you see what you've gone through them do go through what she has done it's it's a seismic change in your life but it's the pursuit of happiness absolutely but you know at the end of the day max it really does come down to technique and skills you could be as strong as you want but skill technique will always conquer well i agree with you there rolo-po but that's a that's an argument people bring up and they'll they'll beg to differ big now the strength to try to go up does pretty well gets her on the ground now as you can see how her ground game goes this is uh for silly provost the uh uncharted waters yeah not your typical wrestling double takedown as you can see she had to hold her up there for a while usually your arrestor will straight down for the e-air or even to the ankles to be honest is to bring them all the way down she had to lift her up like a deadlift and then she brought her down glofans got the back of provost and now it's gonna be in a deep and the tap a lot of magloplin victorious in her mma debut via the rear naked choke had to take a lot of pressure to get there but she did yep beat the woman in the ribs uh had her bleeding the face choked her out you know you hear them say uh if you can't beat them join them well if you want to beat them join them in a lot of a cloth in this case now but the announcer says i don't know how to feel about this but certainly alana feels good and that's the most important thing i don't know how i feel or how anybody feels or how the woman getting pumbled in submission right now feels but all that matters is how the trans person feels if it makes him feel good to be a woman who are we to judge the pursuit of happiness he says this is the pursuit of happiness as this this man is in the process of punching a woman in the ribs we all pursue happiness in our own ways now i'm just paraphrasing the announcer's here a little bit and then finally um here they are at the conclusion of the fight sharing their their closing thoughts about everything that we've all just watched that was a game plan and it worked to her advantage kudos to salish she took the fight and kudos to alana right now i'm sure a lot of teenagers adults are emotional yes uh victory for the trans community and the conversations will go from here as to what's next for alana mcglaughlin whether this should be part of the sport right now that doesn't matter alana mcglaughlin has gone through hell and high water to get here this was a fight that was supposed to happen august the sixth put on hold finally here in the first week of september second week of september happens yes a lot of teenagers and adults are emotional what does that mean by the way a lot of teenagers and adults are emotional watching this what and what they're having conversations and the trans communities have in conversations and there are some who might say maybe that this shouldn't be a part of the sport that this sport should not be a stage and ground for men to beat the hell out of women some might say that but that doesn't matter now because again the trans person feels good he's feeling very good about all of this and that's what matters that's the only thing that matters in the whole world the world itself indeed exists simply to make trans people feel good about themselves all of us on our deathbeds when surrounded by our loved ones will surely ask ourselves one question did i during my life make trans people feel good about themselves and woe to those who cannot say yes on that day what regret what terrible regret again i'm slightly paraphrasing what we just said now you have to ask yourself do any of these men hosting this fight and commenting on it actually think that any of this is okay or logical or morally justifiable no they don't yeah i can read their minds and tell you they don't we can say with certainty they don't yet they cooperate with this grotesque absurdity and that's the story of our culture isn't it that's the story the story is not elonomically often the elonomically offlands of the world are not the ones driving the radical social change that we're witnessing they're not the ones driving our society over the cliff which is what which is the the radical change we're witnessing the change is as much the the same as the change that the car undergoes when it goes over a cliff and crashes on the rocks below civilization will not collapse because of them because of the elonomically offlands instead the real revolutionaries unintentionally or all of the millions of normal basically saying people who know that what they're seeing is wrong who know that it is not okay and they know why it is not okay and yet they remain quiet and then ultimately they're forced to participate in the evil that they oppose but oppose silently in their hearts or the opposition doesn't matter and accomplishes nothing you want to almost feel sorry for those announcers who clearly want no part of this but are forced to take part in it anyway but then you realize that they're not forced none of us are really forced it's just that refusing to take part may require sacrifice and many of us are not willing to make the sacrifice no matter how great or small all we have our excuses we make our excuses while our while our civilization rots away beneath our feet i'm personally tired of the excuses i'm tired of gutless cowards like the announcers in that mma match who could have refused to be a part of it or you know what's even better they could have said sure yeah i'll announce this match and then they could have spent the entire time talking about what an absolute travesty the entire thing was that would have taken guts they would have lost their jobs they would have had lots of people coming after them but we're at a point now where you have to do the thing that requires courage and if you won't do it then you're no better than anyone on the other side and that's why today ultimately the announcers in that match and all like them are canceled i believe it there for today thanks for watching thanks
