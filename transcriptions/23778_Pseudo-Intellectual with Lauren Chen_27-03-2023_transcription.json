    "text": " Nothing quite says feminism like violently shouting down a woman for just like you know not knowing her place am I right just run in her mouth love that love that for the progressive movement much tolerance but posy Parker is an activist who's clearly caused quite a stir in New Zealand where this footage is from by the way if you're not familiar with posy Parker as the Daily Mail explains posy Parker whose real name is Kelly j keen is a mama for who dresses in bright jumpsuits and sports a Maryland Monroe style hairdo and is built a following by claiming it's impossible to change sex as she pushes to exclude trans women from female only spaces you see Parker's main shtick is asserting that a woman is an adult human female and that's that's right literally going by the dictionary definition of woman or at least the old fashioned one that alone nowadays is enough to get you branded a transfer by the LGBTQ community so is I guess saying that hey actually I don't want penises in woman's locker rooms essentially for these views and nothing else posy Parker is a woman who's a woman and you know George Parker has been declared public enemy number one by trans activists and you see posy Parker is actually based in the UK and I first heard of her became familiar with her because she was on one of my favorite British podcasts the podcast of the lotus eaters if you guys aren't following them really should be they do you do they do great stuff but she recently embarked on a Australia and New Zealand tour and if you guys know anything about the politics down under you will know that I'm sorry about Australians and Kiwis they are crazy for me to lose Crazy far left authoritarians. Don't get me wrong. The countries are beautiful. There are a lot of nice people from there, but I mean, just look at COVID. Look what those countries did during the pandemic. Just insane lockdowns. And I wish I could say that those policies were just far out of left field for those countries, but they're not. And unfortunately, they've also been infested with far left gender ideology as well. In fact, so offended were some people in New Zealand that posy Parker or someone with posy Parker's views would dare to come to their country that get this. They actually tried to bar her from entry as it reported quote a number of LGBTQ rights groups had pushed for New Zealand's immigration authorities to deny her entry to the country on the grounds that she posed a threat to public order on Friday, though New Zealand's High Court rule that the decision to allow keen men shall entry to the country was lawful I condemn her inflammatory violent incorrect worldviews would said because of course, while upholding someone's basic civil liberties. It's best to just simultaneously explain that you think they're vile, reprehensible person. However, he had consulted with immigration New Zealand and concluded that the case does not meet the threshold for ministerial interventions. So yes, despite their best efforts, activists were not successful in barring this woman entry into the country. And so she did ultimately go on to hold an event, which did not go amazing. As you can see from the footage we played earlier, as well as tons more footage that's been posted on social media since when she actually appeared to give her her talk, essentially saying that yes, biological sex is real. You can't snap your fingers, get some surgery and become a woman. Women spaces should be saved for only women. She was met with it looks like thousands of protesters who by the way weren't just there to show up and peacefully let their opposition to her be known. No, no, things got ugly real fast. And I would say they even did get violent to the fact that police ended up having to intervene. Pretty shocking stuff. And now this is what Parker had to say after the event. She says, I do feel like public enemy number one out here. Genuinely, I feel afraid. I'm a hate figure. I didn't realize how much women are hated by some parts of society before I came here. I feel like there are some great powers somewhere who don't want women talking. She continued saying, I can take being called a transphobe but calling someone a Nazi? One of the politicians here called me a C word. They used rhyming slang of drop kick and punt. The warm woman in these countries is absolutely frightening. I have got to have a team of seven security guards out here with me. I generally do feel my life could be in danger sometimes. You don't get to call yourself a progressive, a feminist or a human rights champion of any type if you are okay with the way that this woman is being treated regardless of her abuse. It doesn't even matter. We'll get to her opinions in a second. But it doesn't matter. As long as this woman is merely just saying things and not actually doing physical violence to anyone, you do not get to treat someone like this. It makes me so upset that we are living in a society where Australians and Kiwis are. It's considered okay to do this to someone simply because you disagree with them. Where you think you have the right, the entitlement to shut someone else up to threaten them, harass, intimidate them. I'm sure a lot of these people would have violently hurt Posey Parker simply because she believes that a woman is a female. How far has the over-ten window shifted where literally the dictionary definition is now enough to set these people off? I'm sorry, but I don't want to hear a single thing about right-wing extremism or right-wing violence as long as the left continues to do stuff like this. This is not an unusual circumstance. We see this type of thing all the time on college campuses in America, in Canada, in the UK, when a speaker comes that students don't like. It's not acceptable. And honestly, shame on the police departments and the New Zealand government as a whole for not doing more to ensure that Posey Parker had her right protected to express herself. Although I'm also pretty sure these countries don't have freedom of speech because, well, I mean, just look at them. But honestly, I do think it's important to just drive home the point that if you're someone watching this video who believes that a woman is an adult human female and that, yeah, if you're a male, a dude, you probably shouldn't be in women's sports. You probably shouldn't be in the ladies locker room. Don't forget that this is exactly how these people would treat you. This is not just Posey Parker personally. They have a problem with it's her worldview. It's her opinions, opinions that if you're watching this, you likely share and that should absolutely terrify you. And so I don't want to be lectured anymore from the progressive left about unity and coming together and tolerance and acceptance because it's clear that they hate us. They hate us for our views. And so I'm kind of done pretending like there's any common ground to be had with a lot of these crazies. And it's interesting because this whole trans issue, it really is ultimately highlighting that women, I've said it before, I'll say it again, we are now no longer at the top of the oppression hierarchy. I'm sorry, ladies, but unless you're identifying as some other type of gender, we just, we no longer cut it as a protected class. Now, it's all about the trans is their feelings and their quote unquote rights. And it doesn't even matter if you're a powerful woman. Ultimately, you still have to bend the knee to them or you're going to get it, especially on the Internet. And here I am talking about JK Rowling. So JK Rowling is probably the most famous turf or trans exclusionary radical feminist in that JK Rowling is a feminist, but who also happens to believe in biological sex and isn't afraid to talk about it. Well, seeing what happened to Posey Parker down under for views that yeah, JK Rowling, I mean, it seems she mostly shares. She's been speaking up about it on her Twitter account and getting a lot of negative attention for it too. She wrote, There are multiple videos of Kelly J being assaulted. Women have become used to lies, threats of violence, an outright denial of reality. But if you imagine anyone feels defeated, think again, your men's rights activists showed the world exactly who they are. Hashtag let women speak. And I love that actually. Yes, let's point out that these trans activists, they are essentially men's rights activists who are shouting down the women who are trying to protect women's rights. Like, let's, you know, you can try to layer any type of identification intersectionality on top of it that you want, but ultimately that is what's happening here. These are men and men's rights activists who are shouting down women who are arguing for their sex based rights. So progressive. I love it. She also wrote, After the repellent scenes from New Zealand in which a mob assaulted women speaking up for their rights, hashtag the lesbian project is being intimidated and threatened in the UK right now. Oh, because don't forget, these are also the same people, the people who don't like Posey Parker, who do believe that if you're a lesbian, you should like penis as long as that penis identifies as a woman's penis. Logical consistency. What is it? I don't know. And it's interesting. JK Rowling also retweeted this post from someone saying I always thought it would be the Trump supporters who would end up beating feminists in the streets. But no, it's progressives. What a colossal waste of time. The past 20 years of my political activism has been. And that's what really gets me. It's like the left will call the right intolerant and all of these different names simply for not using someone's preferred pronouns, but they can literally go on crusades to ban someone from coming into the country. Pretty xenophobic. If you ask me, they can violently shout down women who are just speaking their minds and that's that's okay because it's done for the right reasons. And in the past, I would have said that the left has no standards except for double standards, but I'm increasingly believing that no, they have a very clear set of standards and that's if it's to support their cause, it's acceptable. And anything is justified. The ends do justify the means. So yeah, that's a new way that I've started seeing things. It's not a double standard. It's one very consistent standard of I will do whatever it takes to further my worldview and hurt my enemies. And I gotta say, it's been working for them. And honestly, yes, because these scenes are taking place in New Zealand and they center around a British activist, I'm sure a lot of Americans watching this are thinking, well, at least it's not happening over here. Look at look at those foreigners. They're crazy, but you are kidding yourself. If you think that similar things would not happen in places like San Francisco or New York because they absolutely would. I mean, don't kid yourself. If you are someone who does believe that a woman is an adult human female, increasingly the left sees you as violent, just for being, for denying the existence of trans women, whatever it is, and that's not the right thing. And if you are a sane person watching this, then yes, you have a vested interest in people like Posey Parker being able to speak and do so without being harassed and threatened and essentially chased off the street because these are your opinions too that she's fighting to normalize. So go ahead, follow her on social media, show her some support because she definitely needs it. And we will, I guess, stay tuned to see if any craziness follows her when she gets to Australia and I'm thinking that it probably will. That's it for now though, and as always, if you guys enjoyed this video, please be sure to like, share, and subscribe. Until next time."
