We are racked and stacked so much to dive into just a couple weeks away from election day, almost now what two weeks to the day. It's crazy, crazy. Crazy how that so it is at two weeks of today. Crazy other time is flying by. I am down here in Fort Pierce, Fort Pierce, pardon me Florida. I am going to be at the Ron DeSantis Charlie Christ debate tonight, which is obviously a big contest here for the governor of Florida. We'll we'll talk a bit about some of that. Clay has got all the latest on the polling. We all need to keep calm and carry on and keep moving because things are looking good for the red things are looking good for the Republicans, but it is a long way from over friends until all the votes are counted. We do not celebrate. We do not get too excited, but we will look at that data. We'll look at how things are trending right now. What is going on across the country? Interesting news item from the last hour or so, just as a teaser here, we have the Biden DOJ announcing a one 30 Eastern time press conference on a national security issue could be much ado about nothing. Clay, let me just ask you before we got other things to break down, Biden speaking over the weekend on a number of issues and how these races are breaking down. We'll do that in a second. What are you feeling on the 130 DOJ press conference? What do you think if we had a menu of possibilities? What's what's the top? So I think what they will do is say that they have uncovered some sort of Russian or Iranian smear attempt for to influence our elections, which will then allow them to pivot back to the threats of our democracy and how dangerous it is. And as we sit here 15 days from the midterms, it will also give them a convenient excuse, because remember the whole Russia collusion lie was based on a few thousand dollars, I think, of Russian Facebook ads that have been purchased, which for anyone who has ever bought ads in a digital context is virtually nothing. Two other possibilities floating around out there, I would say, Buck, one is this could involve the Elon Musk's potential purchase of Twitter. I think it would be aggressive to say something associated with that, but maybe they pause it, don't allow it to go forward based on finding state action that is occurring inside of Twitter's database. And then, by the way, the other one would obviously be, and this would be a crazy hell, Mary, that they are saying something about the Mar-a-Lago investigation in Trump. I just find that to be stunning. I think it'll be the former. There's going to be a state actor who has been doing something to try to impact the election would be my bet. I mean, if they try, I don't, you know, I never, you never want to underestimate crazy and desperate. Crazy and desperate put together can bring about all kinds of obvious insanity. And I think the Democrats are very much in a position right now where they are getting desperate, where they are recognizing that this is their focus on two issues, democracy, which is absurd. And that's the primary one. And abortion is a disastrous, they already realizing this. It's a disastrous policy. In fact, one trend that I noticed over the weekend, and I know you saw this too, very interesting in competitive places, competitive states, New York, Oregon, guess what's going on, everybody? All of a sudden, with the midterms looming, there are some Democrats who are really changing their tune. We are two weeks away from election day. There's early voting underway, right? I mean, this is super late in the game. You have, you have two things going on. Clay one, all of a sudden, Kathy Hochl, the governor of New York, is saying, yeah, we're going to put a lot more cops on the subway because the subway is really not safe enough. And and we take safety seriously. Oh, oh, hold on a second, Clay. Just a few days ago or a few weeks ago, the, I mean, the, the mayor of New York was saying the subway's fine. It's just a perception issue. You mean to tell me that she realizes her job's on the line, and now she's pro cop all of a sudden? What a shock. Yeah, that is not a surprise. And I think we're going to talk about this a little bit later, but I really have made this analogy for a while. But every time I look at the Democrat arguments, it feels to me, Buck, like Democrats are tanking for the overall number one draft pick in a sport. For those of you out there who are not big NBA or NFL fans who pay a lot of attention to this, typically the worst team gets the first pick. And if there's a really talented playmaker out there, a lot of times teams that are bad will say we want that number one pick. The difference is that actually makes sense, Buck, in the context of sports sometimes because you can get an elite transcendent player. It really feels like the incompetence here of the Biden White House has no payoff going forward other than abject misery and failure. And I have to point out to everybody, what you bring up there, tanking to get the number one pick is tied into the plot line of the fantastic movie major league, which is about the Cleveland Indians. There you go. You got it right. With any other sports franchise that may or may not exist out there, just not make sure everyone gets that one right. And Clay, you also you see that in New York, the subway has become, and I grew up in your city. It's a symbol in the danger. It's a symbol of the danger. And the thing is because everybody really who's working and and not able to work from home, at some point, you've got to be on the subway. I mean, unless you're fortunate enough to live walking distance to work or you're a car commuter, if you're in New York City, you're going to be on the subway at some point. And millions, literally millions are on a day to day basis. I think it's two million riders a day, something like that. So or two million rides a day. So that's a huge indicator of what's going on here. All of a sudden at the last moment, Kathy Hochl, who's missed, oh, we're going to put up gun free zone signs in Times Square. That's going to protect you, which is idiocy. And we all know that. She's saying we're going to put more cops on the subway. Mayor Eric Adams is also now saying we're to put more cops on the subway. All of a sudden, what was fear mongering? All of a sudden, what for months Republicans have been saying is being adopted. And in some ways, the even more amazing one, Clay, I know you saw this was Ted Wheeler, who we give credit where it's due here. We're very honest. I have said many times that Bill de Blasio was the worst mayor in America. But I'd always throw in there runner up Ted Wheeler of Portland. Like Portland's Ted Wheeler was a particular is a particularly awful mayor. And he has come out now to say that the I think it's hundreds of unofficial but established homeless encampments in the city of Portland have got to go. He's finally come out and said, you know, we're not just going to allow this endless siege of homelessness against the city. Who are these people sounding like, Clay? They're sounding like you and me and their critics all of a sudden when people are going to start voting. Yeah. Well, this is what sanity versus insanity. What we've talked about for the run up to the midterms. And I think frankly is going to be what we talk about as we get ready for the 2024 presidential election. A lot of times you can take away Democrat and Republican and just replace it with insane and sane. Many Democrat policies are actually insane. And here is the numbers coming out of Portland, uh, Bach, this is, uh, I'm reading our guys at Outkick got it put up. Um, 81% of residents of Portland believe that the George Floyd protest were disastrous for their city. I mean, think about how woke and left wing and filled with white liberals, a city like Portland is probably Portland, Bach. I think you'd probably agree was the Woteopia, uh, for woke white people, still a very white city. They all went in on the idea of America's and awful racist deranged fundamentally evil place. And now 81% of voters think the George Floyd protest were disastrous for the city. You might have seen the, the TV show, Portlandia, which was about that about Portland as this, uh, pseudo idyllic debt, but it was like kind of a more than that thing, right? No, no, of course, but I'm saying, you know, it would make jokes about how people before they could like eat it, you know, eat chicken nuggets, needed to know, well, well, what was the chicken's name? What were the chicken's aspirations in life? Did he have, you know, plenty of free roaming area and all that kind of stuff? It was, it was the distillation of lifestyle liberalism. But when it's, when it's about food and it's about, you know, handicrafts and things like that, that's all fine. Libs are good at that. Libs are good at, you know, it's frustrating, but it's not like destroying the country. Right. But when you talk about public safety, when you talk about efficiency in government, when you talk about law and order, these ideas they have are insane. I mean, that's, that's the only way you can say it. And I have to say as well, you know, come down here in, in Fort Pierce, I'm at WPSL 1590 here and Florida just got it. And we got the DeSantis debate tonight. I'm going to be there against Charlie Chris. The Senate bill causeway, which you talked about last week has been, has been rebuilt. And it's really, I know it sounds like, Oh, well, how, how much of an achievement is that if you see what was washed away in the destruction and you see what it is now, in two weeks, this is remarkable. I mean, it's a remarkable achievement in engineering, the first responders, the people that did this, but it is being overseen by Rhonda Santis. Flip, flip to the other side of the, of the page, Clay, in California, Gavin Newsom has now said that the $1.3 million solo public toilet is such an embarrassment. And it was going to take three years to build it that this is unacceptable. California spends $1.3 million on and three years to build one public toilet. Okay. And in Florida, they can get disaster relief done to the, including a, a causeway. And I know it's a long process, a lot of rebuilding, but they can do projects like the rebuilding of the Senate bill causeway in two weeks. Yeah. Well, not only that in California, we mentioned this, I think on the show, Buck, but the trillions of dollars they're spending on that, that railway, the train that basically is going from nowhere, it's supposed to go LA to San Francisco, right? And instead, it's going to go like not to either of them. And it's way over budget. And nobody's going to ride it. And it is to me an embodiment of the failure of a big government system when only one political party's involved. That, that train may truly be, there may be flying cars by the time that train is finished. Like I'm not kidding. I mean, if you look at the projections, we'll boondog. It's going to be finished like next century. And this is just, and you say, well, how, I think this is so important too. How is this possible? Because this all comes back to folks. Why is cost of living so high? Why is inflation so high? Why does everyone in America feel poorer and less certain of the future? There are reasons for this that tied directly to the Democrat party, to the decisions they've made, to the ideology that animates the Democrat party. And it's, it's unavoidable. Now, I mean, that's why there's this possible red wave, likely red wave that's going to happen now. I mean, Clay, the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department, when they were explaining how do you even spend, like honestly, how do you spend $1.3 million on one toilet? It was quote, cost of planning of permits of reviews of permits of public outreach, of construction management for a toilet. That's how you spend $1.3 million. That is, this is a microcosm of the California public school system of the California public sector unions. Go down the list. They're destroying these states. It's also a perfect representation of people who don't understand business because there is no cost associated issues with something like this, right? Government is not typically very efficient. Lots of big companies are not efficient. But for any of you out there that have worked where profit is the motive, sooner or later somebody looks at the books and says we are spending way too much here, we talked about this last week, Buck. I really do believe that you could cut half of all federal employees in one fell swoop. And the overall efficiency of our federal government wouldn't change at all. Clay, we might have to gas up and get going with the clay and buck helicopter, which doesn't exist yet. But maybe one day and get our buddy Senator Ted Cruz, a quick exfiltration out of the view. Is he finally done over there? Because the clips, wow, does it go? Does it end at noon? The clips over there have been. Yeah, I was watching this. It's great. You got it. We'll tell you, Senator Cruz went into the, uh, the lion's den. And it is exactly what you expected. We'll get to some of that coming up here and also the latest polls. But it is important day in and day out to make sure you're prepared for whatever comes your way. That means taking inventory of how well you and your family are prepared for an emergency. Doesn't have to be something you're thinking about constantly, but a couple times a year, take stock, take inventory, plan smartly. Believe me, it'll pay off the moment you need it. It's more than just making sure you have enough spare batteries. It's factoring in larger events that can affect us and our neighbors for days, perhaps weeks on end. Buying emergency food is a critical part of a preparedness plan. I have emergency food at home. So does clay. But you've got to get it from a place where it's actually high quality food. It's going to last you for many years and it's exactly what you need at a great price. That's what you get when you go to my Patriot supply. They've really fought this through. They know this business backwards and forwards. This is just something you need to have. It's like food insurance that you keep for yourself. Go to prepare with clay and buck.com. That's the website. Prepare with clay and buck.com. You'll save $250 off a three month emergency food kit from my Patriot supply. That's right. $250 off. Now is the time. Don't wait. Get your emergency food set up today. Prepare with clay and buck.com is the website. You'll save $250. Go back in clay, Travis, Buck Sexton show. When I encourage all of you, subscribe to the podcast, make sure you don't miss a single moment as we sit here 15 days out from the midterm. As we are going to be tracking it down every single day and certainly you want to be with us during the holidays. As many of you might be moving around the country during Thanksgiving and Christmas, just go ahead and sign up. You'll make sure we buck was looking at him. We got a lot of funny reviews. I'm going to put dub on the review chart. And if he we read one of your funny reviews, then you will get a shout out. You were telling me they were really good. And some of them are really funny. I mean, the really, the really smart reviewers start out with dub is a handsome genius and scholar of the highest order, things like that. So that'll get you that will get you in the mix fast. That's how you appeal to to everybody out there. All right. So Buck, right beforehand, I didn't even know I haven't watched the view live on television. I think we're going to have a few clips from it. But Ted Cruz was on the view live in New York City. I don't think you saw it because you're in Florida gearing up for that Chris DeSantis debate. But I watched the whole thing. And first of all, they had a hecklers, which I've never watched the view full disclosure live before in my life. So, but I would imagine that they typically don't have techlers. They then had to go to break in order to get them out because they were all screaming at Ted Cruz. Now, Ted Cruz, even I think there were like five women sitting at the table. And they all like teed off on him or whatever, because they all hate him. But I give him credit for having him on. And this is not going to surprise you. I mean, Ted Cruz was an Ivy League debate champion. And so he really filleted all of these women right there on their show in front of their audience. And I'm curious how much play this will get on social media. Did they have to dial down the hostility a little bit though? Because I saw a clip where audience members were shouting profanity at him, right? So at that point, when you're the hosts, it's actually it's embarrassing, right? Because if you bring somebody actually apologize to Cruz for their audience's reception and response to me, I mean, I was on the Bill Marshall for the first time and someone in the audience who was actually calling out bill. And I was like, this is he wasn't I didn't bring this guy. But someone stood up and interrupted the show in the middle of the show. And I would tell you that the staff is legitimately, they get flustered by that because it's their house, you know, they they're responsible for what it shows up, right? So what did they do then? Did they just cut tape and bring it back as if it hadn't happened? Oh, no, he was live and they had security escort the guy out. Yeah, and that's that's how they do that kind of stuff. But, you know, it never I don't know people that want to shout stuff. It's so it's childish. It's not worth it. Let's take Cruz debate them and crush them. Yeah. And look, again, I give credit for them having him on. But but man, it was pretty good television. I mean, people screaming in the crowd, everything else. I enjoyed it. Look, midterms are here. And not only does your vote matter enormously, but also how you choose to spend your money matters a great deal to about your cell phone bill. Do you know, if you're using right now Verizon, AT&T or T mobile, all of those companies, they hate your politics. And you could make a choice and not give money to woke wireless companies. You could save a ton of money up to $1,000 a year, keep your same number and keep your same phone and just allow your money to go to a company peer talk that supports your beliefs. Right now, you can sign up by Dowling pound two 50 say Clay and Buck 50% off your first month. Again, it's easy. Dial pound two five zero say Clay and Buck make the switch to peer talk. Welcome back to Clay and Buck on this Monday, October 24 15 days from the big day and some fascinating dynamics playing out all across the country. One of them is that we were right about everything. We were right about meaning you, me, Clay, we were right about COVID about crime and the border about inflation, all these things. And it's finally catching up to Democrats. But there's also the overhang here or the backdrop of a Biden administration that is run by, at least in theory, people always get mad at me to say he's not really the president of the people around tomorrow. Okay. Well, he is still the figurehead though. Right? He is still the guy. Joe Biden is the most incompetent president. That's a very different argument than an auxiliary member making arguments about the Obama White House, the Obama administration. That was their ideas were bad. I disagreed with what they were trying to do. And there was a obviously we could talk for hours and hours about what was going on then. But there was a competency in the socialism and big government enacting that was going on. There was some sense that while their ideas were bad, everyone knew that Barack Obama like knew what was going on and was calling a lot of the shots with Joe Biden. Not only do you have bad ideas and in many ways, just a continuation of the Obama presidency and an extension of some of the far left ideas that Obama began to enact or began to make a function of national policy at the exact for the executive branch. You have a guy who just doesn't really know what's going on. That's one part of this. And here we had an MSNBC interview with Joe Biden, where it becomes very clear. This is not someone who should be, and I shouldn't say becomes we've known this all along, but yet again, here is Joe Biden when he's asked specifically, are you slowing up? And the numbers would indicate even without knowing anything about Joe Biden, just based on age, of course, he's slowing up. But here is his response to it. It's it's almost a minute here, but we want you to hear this is the commander in chief of the United States right now, the number one executive, play, play clip two. I think it's a legitimate thing to be concerned about anyone's age, including mine. I think that's totally legitimate. But I think the best way to make the judgment is to, you know, watch me. You know, am I slowing up and my don't have the same pace and her, you know, and that old joke, you know, everybody talks about the, you know, the new 70s, 50s, all that stuff, you know, I, you know, it could be, I'm a great respecter of faith. I could get a disease tomorrow. I could, you know, drop dead tomorrow. But I, you know, in terms of my energy level, in terms of how much I'm able to do, I think people should look and say, is he still have the same passion for what he's doing? I mean, Clay, it's insulting. Am I slowing up? He says, while he meanders and mumbles and is slowing up. I can't believe they let him keep doing interviews. And I'm not someone who believes that you should have to hide the president and put him in the basement and basically script as few of activities as you possibly can. But Buck, every single time he does an interview, I think he destroys further credibility for himself and his administration. I mean, he is the best asset right now that Republicans have. I mean, the fact that he went on the road and campaigned for John Federman and said that he thought it was really important John Federman wins. I mean, that is to me a gift for Dr. Oz's campaign because I can't imagine for even if you voted for Joe Biden. And I know there are some of you listening right now who did vote for Joe Biden. And I bet if you are listening to us, you are part of a large majority of people in the country who wish that Joe Biden was not now the president. And you bought into the idea that he was going to restore normalcy to the White House and that the adults were going to be back in charge and that he was going to run the nation in a bipartisan basis. And you just didn't see and or know how to crepit and dementia late in this guy was going to be. But just listening to that interview, imagine what his conversations that are unscripted are like with global leaders. There's no way if he's talking to Chairman Z in China or he's talking to NATO leaders in the rest of the world right now that they are looking around after that call and saying, you know, who's really on top of things, Joe Biden, just compare him to Santas and the response to the hurricane, just the ability to process information and know what's going on in the world. Joe Biden is a broken old man who doesn't have the wherewithal to run a single gas station much less than United States government. And you also touched on, I think, a critical second component of the awakening that is going on right now across the country for people that are finally in, let's just say in the last few weeks, maybe the last few months saying, this has gone too far. This is crazy. On the one hand, there's the obvious slowing down senility early stage of dementia component and also just the lack of energy of being that age. Look, at that age, there's a lot of amazing things you can do. No question about it. Being president of the United States is not one of them. Okay. Not, not to the fullest extent that is needed for the maximum benefit of the Republic, but put all that aside for a second. You mentioned Joe Biden was supposed to be a uniter. He was really supposed to calm the passions of the lunatic left. You know, that was how they sold him to Democrat swing voters or centrist or moderates or you name it. It was Joe Biden. You know, he's not crazy. Meanwhile, back in reality, as in what's actually happening, Biden just at the White House hosted a transgender TikTok star named Dylan Mulvaney. And this is Joe Biden, old man Joe Biden, supposed to be kind of traditional clay, Joe Biden, the friend of the union, the working man, the lunch pail over your knees when you're doing the coal mining, you know, all this, this total propaganda around Joe Biden. They've been pushing for years. This is what he says about transgender surgery slash affirming care, whatever they're calling it for minors play clip three. Do you think states should have a right to ban gender affirming health care? I don't think any state or anybody should have the right to do that. As a moral question, as legal question, I just think it's wrong. I just want to be clear, Clay, your home state. We had on the attorney general for Tennessee. What last week? Joe Biden here, the president of the United States, Mr. Moderate, you know, you know, gun, totem, love the constitution, blue dog, Democrat Joe or whatever. That Joe Biden is saying that states that are that are preventing gender mutilation of children is immoral and illegal. That's the Joe Biden who sits in the Oval Office. Yeah, look, and again, I would go and continue to echo that. I think we have Biden voters. I think we got a lot of black Hispanic Asian voters out there, especially parents. What do we say? The parents are breaking. I think it was 64 to 29, like basically a 35 point margin. If you have kids, you are overwhelmingly voting Republican this midterm. I think it's because this is evil. Let's just call this what it is. And before I get into the transgender affirming care, Buck, we don't allow kids to get tattoos under the age of 18 years old because we're worried about what tattoos they may get. And we don't want that to be on their arms or their legs or their backs or wherever you get a tattoo for the rest of their lives. Yet we're going to allow 14 year olds to get their genitals chopped off and change their gender forever. And it's a moral right. And states shouldn't be trying to protect minors, teenagers, from making life altering decisions like this. I'd question whether Joe Biden, but can even comprehend what he's saying on this issue. Because I find it impossible to believe he really believes it. It also though goes to the reality here that Joe Biden, his entire presidency was sold to the American people on really a series of lies. Now people are yelling out right now what those lies are. There's a lot of them. But the notion of Joe Biden as a moderate uniting, calming presence in American politics, you just heard the presence of United States say that anyone who tries to stand in the way of activists deciding to push a 14 year old to cut off her female breasts and take testosterone or whatever to transition to male, anyone who stands in the way of that is immoral and breaking the law. Although or you know, it's it's not legal based on what Joe Biden knows nothing about the law. But that's who the president is right now, everyone. They always say, Clay, Oh, it's just a minor issue. Why do Republicans make such a big deal of it? This is from the president of the United States. It's a big deal. And we should also make clear, I think, Buck, if you're over 18, if you are an adult and you want to get these treatments, they're allowed. Now we can question whether it's going to ultimately make the person who's doing it happier. But all we're saying right here is we shouldn't be doing these kinds of surgeries to minors. We shouldn't be cutting genitals off of 14 year old children. Mrs. Craig is just Biden was asked about this is all that children and state laws protecting children from the trans agenda of gender affirming care, meaning removing removing genitalia, cutting off breasts, putting puberty blockers in play, all these things. And Joe Biden says there's a moral duty to allow that. That is that's Mr. moderate uniting Democrat that you can trust who's not is not crazy. That's the closing argument, Buck. This is what the Democrats are focused on. I mean, this is the tank for the number one pick argument I'm making. It's mind blowing to me. Come back. We do have some some of those Ted Cruz view clips from the view, which you're going to want to hear. But right now we got a very important mission. Unborn children need our help. No organization knows that better than the people working with the preborn pregnancy clinic. They hear and see the heartbeats of unborn babies every day. And at each of the preborn clinics, their mission is to allow expectant mothers to see the child they're carrying with a free ultrasound. The bond is often immediate and the subsequent decision is to choose life for that child and no longer contemplate an abortion. It is a heartfelt moment. A life changing one, a godly one when the ultrasound and love and caring and support is all that is needed is all that is provided. That happens with donations to preborn from individual individuals like you and me. We set a goal of helping to rescue 40,000 babies one ultrasound at a time. One ultrasound is just $28. And now through a match, your gift will be doubled. Any gift size will help. I know times are tough. I know inflation. I know those bills are rough right now, but your donation is tax deductible. And you can help save a tiny baby's life today. If you have the means, would you please consider a gift? You can do so with an easy to make phone call or a website visit with your cell phone right now. You can dial pound 250 and say the key word baby to talk to somebody at preborn right now. That's pound 250 and just say the word baby. Or you can go online, go online and donate at preborn.com slash buck. That's preborn.com slash b-u-c-k. Welcome back in clay Travis Buck Sexton show top of the next hour. I'm going to run you through with my election nerd sampling of both the most recent polls and also the gambling odds kind of a coalition of those to take you out to Arizona to Nevada to Wisconsin to Pennsylvania to Georgia. All of the battleground states that are going to decide in many ways. What exactly the makeup of the Senate looks like in 2022 as we sit here 15 days out. I will give you the absolute latest there. But we're having some fun. Senator Ted Cruz who has scheduled to join us, I believe on Wednesday and I'm going to be at a rally with him Buck here on Wednesday in my hometown of Nashville actually Franklin just south of town where we have a competitive congressional seat makes up part of the Nashville's congressional seat Cruz on a bus tour and I'm going to be appearing with with him and who I think is going to be the next congressman from the Nashville area, Andy Ogles, which should be a lot of fun. So if you're in the Franklin area, you can Google that you can come hang out and we're going to be doing an event there. But I wanted to make sure that everybody out there was aware of the fun that was had earlier. The view made the decision to have Ted Cruz on. Now he was in New York. I saw last night a lot of Yankee fans Buck were not giving Ted Cruz a great welcome in the Yankees. I believe they gave him what is called the Bronx salute. I do believe that they gave him the Bronx salute indeed. It did not go fabulously well for them as the Yankees were eliminated by the Astros. So everybody out there listening. We got monster audiences in New York City and in Houston. So that was a battle of two different fan bases that are listening to us probably quite a bit right now. But I told you I was watching this a lot. This was just about an hour ago. The ladies of the view had Ted Cruz on. He started talking and Hackers began to yell out. Listen. Let us do our job. Let us do our job. We hear what you have to say. But you got to go. I just want to say. Go bird. Yeah. I wanted her own audience. Buck. It's interesting to see. First of all, it's very it's like, you know, they're people, right? They're audience. You know, it's like when you and I see someone listen to our show, they want to like high five or hug whatever there are people. This is their people at the view. They're audience. And it's so disrespectful actually to the host to do this to a guest. But here's the thing because it makes the host look bad. Like they look amateurish. They look, they look, you know, second tier. They look JV. But but also it's just a reminder. Conservatives just don't really do this. I mean, once in a very rare rare while you'll see someone who yells something at someone. But I really do think this goes into the evidence pile for being a leftist today is an anxiety disorder. Like they're people that are emotionally disordered from their beliefs about climate and threats to our democracy and like they're just crazy. You it is emblematic of the culture that the left has created where if anybody has a disagreement with you, you don't actually debate them on the issue. You try to shout them down or question the legitimacy of their right to speak, which is what we see happening on campuses all over the country. Unfortunately, right now, and it's one thing I give credit to the ladies of the view and I very rarely done this on this show. They vote allowed Ted Cruz to come on the show and make his arguments for their audience. Now they questioned him aggressively about it. But that's what should happen, right? People of different opinions should address each other and get outside of their silos and screaming and yelling and saying you can't speak here is the exact opposite of that. Yeah, this is also why people sometimes, I'm sure you get this too. They'll say, Hey, you guys should have on and when you were doing a solo show before when I was doing a solo show, same thing, you guys should have on this liberal and really have it out. The problem is on radio, people now, everyone just wants to talk over each other. You have to have so much respect and discipline on radio to have a debate that's worth hearing that doesn't turn into cross talk. But it goes to show you on TV TV. It's it's a little bit easier. There's all you know, there's visuals to go with it. There's visual cues. But Clay, imagine if we actually had Democrats have to like, I would love to debate a Democrat on the wisdom of Joe Biden's position about surgery for minors, transgender surgery for minors like, but it doesn't exist anywhere. No one ever debates on the left anymore. They just preach to the choir. I've said this forever in the world of sports, take it outside of politics. I will debate with any person in the country who has a substantial audience whether girls should have to compete against boys based on gender ideology. Find the most brilliant transgender scholar who wants to take that perspective in the world of sports. I will show up and I will crush them. They won't debate. They won't actually allow their opinions to be challenged. They just won't do it. Got a bunch of polls, folks. The latest races that's coming up."
