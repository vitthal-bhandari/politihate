    "text": " Alright guys, question of the day, should psychedelics be legalized? That is a big question. Plus later on, we're going to talk about not Rachel Dollasal, but another race baker that's in town. We have a woman who's posing as a social justice activist. She's claimed that she was a Latin and South Asian and Arab descent. But now she's being outed by her own mother, who confirms that she's a liar, and that she's actually as quote, white as the driven snow. All that and more today coming up on Candace Owens. So I have no answers in this monologue for you today. Just a question, should psychedelics be legalized? And also an understanding that in this one space, I do find that conservatives have become hypocritical. I like to talk about conservative hypocrisy because it's important that we don't always constantly critique the left, but that we also pause to examine ourselves and what has really become our body of truth. And I'll tell you how this discussion came up. Well, me and my friend and colleague and actually godfather to my child, Michael Knowles, had this discussion on camera. It'll come out later about whether or not psychedelics should be legalized. And obviously Michael Knowles, hard line, he said absolutely not. And he gave me all of the reasons why not. And I told him why I've always been very uncomfortable speaking with conservatives about drugs that should be legalized or drugs that should remain illegal, mainly because I can't pretend that I don't see this glaring hypocrisy. Now what is a discussion concrete before, even predating this discussion with Michael Knowles, I had a talk with Rick Santorum actually. He was sitting next to me at a dinner. It was about maybe, I don't know, 12 people at this very small dinner. It was a fishing trip. And Rick Santorum, by the way, I want to make this very clear, lovely man. He's honestly so kind and I've gotten to know him in a small capacity. He was drinking a giant glass of red wine next to me. And somehow the topic of pot smoking came up and he talked about how awful it was that it was being decriminalized and how we had to put this genie back in the bottle. And he essentially was just saying that people that do drugs is so terrible, he had never smoked pot in his entire life. Well, I was an interesting audience. Not because I thought that we should decriminalize pot or that pot should become legal or anything like that, but because I had tried smoking pot. I've been open about that in the past. I smoked pot in college, absolutely hated it. You know my personality now, it makes sense that I would hate it. It made me so paranoid. I mean, I am talking, put the blankets over my head was convinced that every sound and siren outside were the police coming to get me and put me into prison because I did drugs. It was not fun. It just was not a fun experience for me. It gave me the, I mean, I can't even, I feel crippled right now thinking about the anxiety that it gave me, just not a fun time. And I had tons of friends that smoked pot and they smoked it every day. These were art majors. These were people that were majoring in fashion. And obviously I guess it had a more sedative effect on them. But let me be very clear, the same people that smoked pot, like me, were also drinking on Thursdays and Fridays and Saturday nights because it was college and that's what you do. You've been drinking college. Let me tell you something. They were harmless when they were smoking pot. We were not so harmless when we were drinking. It's a glaring hypocrisy. You're drinking a glass of wine, trying to tell me about how bad the pot smokers are. Pot, in my opinion, no one should smoke pot because it turns people into losers. That's my honest perspective. You eat a bunch, you binge eat, you sit on a couch for whatever reason, you got to wear a beanie. I don't know why they got to grow your hair out and wear a beanie. I was a part of it, the heart of the entire experience. And you're laid back. You don't become a productive member in society. In my view, by the way, you're open to disagree with that. You might be high right now listening to this podcast, but in my view, you would be a better version of yourself if you weren't, right? But drinking, you're kidding me? Think about your social circles. Think about the things that you have seen people do when they were drunk. Think about the men that you have seen women regret sleeping with. Think about the fights that you've seen broken out. Think about the arguments that you've had because something possessed you when you were drunk. I am so vividly recalling a fight that I have with my friends about a political position that I didn't even believe in. I woke up, I had no details of this fight. I was apparently kicking her car door and telling her to let me out, let me out because we drank some really cheap Russian vodka, right? This is who I became when I drank. I became possessed. How many times have you seen a fistfight break out because drinking was involved? How many times do you remember a friend who got a DUI who had to deal with these things? These are the things that happen when we drink. We know drinking, of course, is the work between the two, drinking is worse. There's no question of that. So I've never quite understood the conservatives who are not anti-drinking, right? Maybe they don't go so far as to believe that we need to bring prohibition back, but they drink themselves and they look around them and they see what society has become because we use it as a social lubricant, what society has become since the time of prohibition. Is this a good reflector society? Did you think that you become a better person, that people are becoming better on the whole when they drink? When they examine the households that are broken, the people that are growing up with alcoholic parents, people that are going to rehab because of alcohol, how people do you know that did something evil when they smoked a joint? Now, they killed somebody because they smoked a joint. I mean, I'm asking you a serious question. You don't. You think of these people as, mmm, lose-a-ish but harmless. So for me, this has always been a glaring point of hypocrisy. And it's a difficult one to conquer when you're speaking to someone who basically thinks that all drugs are exactly like heroin, right? And that's kind of work center. He's never tried a drug in his life. And so he thinks drinking is okay because it's always been okay in his lifetime. There was no prohibition. There's no arguments against him having a glass of wine, but he looks at smoking pot as terrible. Again, I have no answers. I'm just telling you how I personally feel about it. I am somebody who is actually a non-drinker. I very rarely drink because I don't think drinking is great. I also don't think that you should prohibit people from drinking. I don't think we need a law. We don't need to bring back the 18th Amendment. But I do think that opening discussion as to why we have found drinking to be so socially acceptable, right? And totally fine. Totally fine. We are all Rick Santorum. We're like a glass of red wine, great at dinner, no problem whatsoever. And then we look at people that smoke pot and we say drug addict. Why? What happened here? It's probably a little bit of social conditioning, probably just deciding telling us that drinking is okay when all of the signs around us make it clear and it's not. I'm going to examine this topic more. I just wanted to offer the question and get your feedback on how you feel about drinking when you weigh it against drugs like pot or people in terms of psychedelics who are microdosing on trunes. What are your actual opinions because I want to include them in a longer episode as we explore this topic, as we explore post-prohibition America and we ask ourselves whether or not society has gotten better. And that's all I'm going to say about that. Thomas Sol once said, why have a national debt ceiling if it doesn't really put a ceiling on a national debt? The United States blew through the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling last month and still the White House refuses to reduce spending. With that amount of money you can buy homes for almost every one in the United States. Our economy is in trouble. It's time to start thinking about your investments and your future.

Western civilization, we're doing great. We are doing great. And I'm going to prove it to you by getting into some of these stories. First up we have Daniel Eastwood. Are you familiar with Daniel Eastwood? Probably not. Daniel Eastwood now goes by Sophie Eastwood and Daniel's a transgendered killer. Let me tell you a story because I think it's pretty incredible. It's just weird. It's all over the place. So Daniel Eastwood was initially jailed at Dumfries Young Offenders Institution. This is in Scotland for dangerous driving at the age of 18. Okay, not a heavy offense whatsoever. Well, he was a month away from the end of his sentence when suddenly he decided to strangle his cellmate. I'm sorry I'm laughing because this is just things escalated very quickly here, right? He's in there for dangerous driving. Then he decides he's going to strangle his cellmate who was another 22 year old. He strangles him to death with shoelaces, right? That was back in 2004. So what did Daniel Eastwood do? Now obviously he was going to be in prison for a much longer time than he would have been for dangerous driving. He decided that actually he identifies as a female named Sophie. Because western civilization is great and super smart, as he began transitioning, they allowed him to be held at the Quarantine Vale, which is Scotland's only all female jail. Because obviously after you strangle your inmate with shoelaces, you should be awarded by being a lot of transfer yourself to an all female prison. So then what happened was that at this same prison, they were suddenly at the center of a huge social argument because one of the transgender inmates he was going by the name Isla Bryson was actually a convicted rapist. He had actually attacked two women as he was living as a man. And then obviously he got to prison. He was like, no, no, no, actually I'm a woman. And so this sparked a huge national debate. And they said this is ridiculous. These rules need to be reversed. And so now going back to Sophie Eastwood, formerly Daniel Eastwood, he's thinking, oh my gosh, am I going to have to transfer back to an all male prison? That wouldn't be fair to me. I didn't do what Isla did. I only strangled my roommate with shoelaces. But my roommate was a guy. I haven't done anything. In fact, this is actually Sophie Eastwood's argument. Now he's 38 years old. He is saying that he has not done anything against women and doesn't feel that he should have to suffer the consequences. And now you're not going to believe this. He's transitioning again. He has transitioned. He's not just a woman or he formerly was a woman. He formerly was a man. But now he's a baby. He's transitioned to a baby. He identifies as a baby. And can you imagine what he's going through completely traumatized because he's being treated like an adult human being after announcing last year that he was a baby. He demanded that guards hold his hand and he also asked for nappies and for baby food. I know word on whether or not the guards gave him the baby food. I mean, in a world where you can just identify as anything, wouldn't it be a crime not to get him the nappies and to get him the baby food? I don't know. By the way. There used to be a time in America where you could refer to transgenderism as a. By the way, if you're wondering why we just bleeped those words, it's because we will get hit with a strike if we refer to transgenderism as a. Even though it used to be considered that by the DSM five and I learned in school that gender dysphoria was in fact a. Now, before we do the rules, you can get hit with a strike and you can get in trouble and you can be centered and de-platformed if you acknowledge that. So I guess pretty soon on these big tech platforms, if you don't acknowledge that Daniel Eastwood now Sophie Eastwood is now baby Eastwood, we're going to get with strikes. If you yourself are not condoning societal beep beep, people being. You could lose your platform. So that's what we are to say everybody. We are doing great. Can not get enough of this story, mostly because it deals with an office of equity and diversity on campus, Vanderbilt here in Tennessee in the great state of Tennessee. So there was a horrific shooting over at MSU. I'm sure you guys follow that. And so Vanderbilt got wind of this and decided that they should send an email to all of its students. Okay, great. They tasked their office of equity, diversity and inclusion with doing this. And rather than a person sitting down and actually authoring an email to the students, they used chat GPT. So they decided to just turn to AI technology and say, what should you say to students after a shooting takes place, robots? And the AI did actually write an email, the email, right? I'm just reading one piece of it. The recent Michigan shootings are a tragic reminder of the importance of taking care of each other, particularly in the context of creating inclusive environments. As members of the Peabody campus community, we must reflect on the impact of such an event and take steps to ensure we are doing our best to create a safe and inclusive environment for all. One of the key ways to promote a culture of care on our campus is through building strong relationships with one another. This involves actively engaging with people from different backgrounds and perspectives, listening to their stories and showing empathy and support. We can also look out for another by noticing signs of distress and offering support to those who may be struggling with mental health issues. I'm just going to stop there. It goes on. And essentially at the end of the email, the person who sent it did not recognize and says paraphrased from OpenAI's chat GPT. Now why was this professor so stupid as to send out this email and not realize it? Probably because if you are a professor or if you are a hire for diversity and inclusion, what it means is that you're probably the dumbest person on campus, right? You were hired because Black Lives Matter did some protests. The university tried to look good. And they said, let's just create a department of diversity and inclusion. And let's hire people that look the part and are probably really dumb. And so they did that. And these are the two women behind the email. I think that they are currently stepping down these two deans. I'm not just getting a job as a dean of diversity and inclusion or stepping down pending further investigation and the doesn't need further investigation. You're a Vanderbilt University. You have a lot of smart kids. They can tell you what happened here. When you hire stupid people, they do stupid things. So I just could not get enough of that. I don't know why the Vanderbilt is shocked at this. These women probably should have never had that position. Speaking of stupid though, the aliens are invading. Obviously the balloons, there are so many in the space. What's going on? Are they coming from Mars? Where are they coming from? Well, in case you missed this, obviously we've been on the edge of our seats wondering, okay, you've shot it down. Now can you identify these UFOs? Well, they did. In the days since the US Air Force, by the way, this cost us half a million dollars, shot down three unidentified objects out of the sky. There were tons of questions about what the objects were. And a report by Aviation Week offered an intriguing hypothesis about what one of those three objects could have been. What was it? Asks you. Well, it was a missing in action, globe trotting balloon belonging to an Illinois-based hobbyist club. Yeah, you heard me correctly. It was a globe trotting balloon belonging to an Illinois-based hobbyist club. A bunch of people got together. They have a hobby. They have these balloons, it's a small Pico balloon, which ranges between $12 and $180. That's the cost. That is the price if you yourself like a Pico balloon. If you yourself want to buy, if you have $12 and you just want to buy one, send it off into the air and watch the United States Air Force come to shoot it down. You can do that. You can do that. You can watch your tax dollars just go out the window because I don't know, people are dumb. And this is pretty much what's happened here. Super embarrassing. It actually turns out that China was right. I told you a couple of weeks ago about the fact that China was mocking by an administration's response, basically saying that this is them pretending to be tough and America isn't tough and it's true. Under a Biden administration, we are not tough. We are not taken seriously. We are being openly mocked by people that are severe adversaries when the Chinese media is openly mocking you because you've spent half a million dollars responding to a hobbyist balloon. It may be time to check yourselves. I hope that we do. I hope that with this election coming up in 2024, that people realize that we are remarkably unsafe in this environment, remarkably unsafe for Russia and China and to all of these other countries to be essentially laughing in our faces where we're not considered tough because we aren't tough. We aren't tough. We don't respond to actual threats like the ones in our border. Imagine if we poured those resources into actually dealing with an actual invasion that's happening at our border and not a hobbyist balloon that is floating in the air.

Anyways, moving on because everything is going swimmingly in Western civilization. We talk a lot about, well, if transgenderism is a thing and we get bleeped for saying that it might be a... What are we going to get in trouble if we talk about these people that are saying that they are transracial? Is that a thing yet? Is that a thing yet? Because it should be one. I am a huge supporter of Richard Alsel. I think that now that we exist in this climate of lies, because in this climate of lies and you have teachers and the ecosystem and big tech that are all pretending that people can pick their genders. There is no reason that by that very same logic that people cannot also pick their races. What is stopping you from waking up one day and deciding that you are Chinese, Japanese, black, white on the basis of how you feel on the inside, right? It's a good question. It's a fair question. And by the way, if you're ever debating somebody that is pro-transgenderism, it's a good thing to ask if they're also pro-transracialism. And I'm bringing this topic up today because there's another Rachel Dalazal except her name is Rachel Sidel except she was going by Raquel Saraswati and she had climbed the ranks. In fact, she was the chief. Here we go again. Equity and inclusion and culture officer. I need up positions at a Quaker Social Justice Group entitled American Friends Service Committee. Miss Saraswati identified as a gay Muslim and she told colleagues that she was Latina and also of South Asian and Arab descent. Of course, what ended up happening was that her mother spoke out and said, I don't know what's gotten into my daughter, but actually she's white. Actually, her mother said it much stronger than that, much stronger terms. Her mother said, quote, that Rachel was as white as the driven snow. Mama wasn't playing around. Mama wasn't playing around. Mama's like, that's my girl and she's white as the driven snow. I don't know what's gotten into her. I don't know why she's pretending to be Arab. And she's done this for quite a long time, by the way. She has gotten away with this delusion. Are we allowed to say that? I don't know. Maybe we should be respecting her races since 2005. She just began claiming that she had Indian ancestry and she then went on to celebrate the election of Kamala Harris as the first Indian American vice president because it was so nice for her to see an Indian vice president when she herself was an Indian, at least on the how she felt on the inside and actuality. She was, as we mentioned, white as the driven snow per her mother. So yeah, she's being likened now to Rachel Dollasal and she was similarly exposed and people are asking the question of how this could have taken place. And there are tons of conspiracy theories of wondering if she was a conservative plant. Nope, we don't claim, we don't claim Raquel Dollasal as people are now referring to her as. But she did, she made it so far as sitting down with conservative hosts. In 2007, she sat down with Glenn Beck. So again, her mother debunked this. She has come out and said that she, the mother, is German and British and that Rachel's father was a Calabris Italian. Her mother says, quote, she's chosen to live a lie and I find that to be very, very sad. Now in her public interfacing, Rachel told people that she was estranged from her family for reasons that she couldn't get into while the reasons are because she was just lying about her entire identity and it would probably be awkward to go home to your white mother and try to tell her that actually you were an Arab. That just might be a, I listen, I'm all for awkward discussions around the holiday, but you don't think of these sorts of discussions that are taking place. You think of a little political banter, but when your child comes home and they're an entirely different race and they're wearing dark bronzer, as she started to do, she started wearing bronzer darker and darker and darker to match how she feels, things could get pretty awkward. So Raquel, we bid you, we bid you well because I think all you need to do is wait five years, let's call it five years and society will catch up and they will begin condoning race, race is according to how you feel and not actually according to what you are. Lastly you guys, we have to get into this Arizona teacher, she made an astounding argument. You know, I talk about all the time that right now we are somehow in a custodial dispute over our children with the state. Like suddenly, I don't know what happened because it was very clear to me when I was a child growing up in school that my parents were my parents and my teachers were my teachers and now you have teachers that believe that their students are their kids, even their language has changed, like our kids, these are my kids, it's like no, these are your students, these are our kids, right, they belong to the parents and you wonder how could they get themselves into this headspace where as a teacher, you feel it's acceptable to lie to parents about their children, right, you know, this is going on, they're lying, they're not, they're calling children by a different name in the classroom and then lying to parents saying, oh it's okay if you're confused about your gender, I'll call you Michael, I know your name is Sydney, but I'm going to call you Michael all day because I'm your teacher and you're my kid, this is kind of the brainwashing, you have to assume it's happening at the university level and then they go on to get these jobs. Well, in case you would like a further look into examining what has possessed these teachers, this brave Arizona teacher has spoken out, she spoke out against a proposed bill in Arizona for schools to ban books, discussing sexuality and LGBTQ ideology, arguing that the purpose of public education is to teach what society needs and she questioned the need for parental input in the curriculum whatsoever. Why, why on earth would parents have any input if I want to teach them about sex, I want to teach your five-year-old and your six-year-old about sex, why do parents need input? She then took it a step further to explain her reasoning, listen to her in her own words. I have a master's degree because when I got certified, I was told I had to have a master's degree to be an Arizona certified teacher. We all have advanced degrees. What do the parents have? Are we vetting the backgrounds of our parents? Are we allowing the parents to choose the curriculum and the books that our children are going to read? I think that it's a mistake and I'm just speaking from the heart. The one line that I love is we must remember that the purpose of public education is not to teach only what parents want their children to be taught. It is to teach them what society needs them to be taught. You heard it, you guys. What do you have? What do you have? She has an advanced degree. I mean, what, what ordains you? What do you, the mom, the dad? Yeah, what do you have? I have an advanced degree and my advanced degree tells me that your kid needs to learn about penises and vaginas and transgenderism when they are in kindergarten. If you have an issue with that, you need to examine yourself and realize that this is public education and we decide what society needs. Right now, what society needs is children that are sexualized before they even get to the third grade. We've got to keep these books in the library because we have the advanced degrees. If you don't follow her logic, it's because you shouldn't. It's because she is a monster. She doesn't realize she's a monster. Right? And this is what happens when people stay in school too long. They actually believe that having a degree gives them all sorts of authority, right? And the authority that they want is over your household. This is why we have to raise our children to think independently. It is why I am against the public education initiatives. I speak openly about the fact that I think that the Department of Education needs to be abolished because it is a hand of the government and that hand of the government wishes to reach into your households and to remove all power from mom and dad. Essentially, it seeks full total omnipotence and we have to stop that. And that's all I have to say about that. All right, we have time to say, so let's jump into some of your comments. A lot of you guys had a lot to say about the James O'Keefe story, as you guys know, essentially being forced out of Project Barataz. The board has a side that they don't want him. I guess one valid reason is that he took a sandwich from a pregnant woman. She was eight months old and he ate that sandwich. And you know what, I agree, that's an offense of sorts. So, point of view ridiculous. Em Mintz, zero eight writes, this is just what corporate companies do. That is nothing compared to what the company, my husband works for, spends on company wide events, like seriously a drop in the bucket. These people are so freaking arrogant, petty and delusional. Yeah, it was extremely petty. You're referring obviously to them listing the fact that he had spent, I think it was $60,000 on a corporate party. So what, the Project Barataz experience is what it was called. I told you guys I was invited. I think what they were relying on is public ignorance to think that that's so much money to spend on a corporate event. And like I said, especially what these individuals at Project Barataz, the pressure that they're under every single day, I would more, I'm more than happy as a donor for my money to go toward them having a great night out. So that did not land as the board thought that it was going to land. Aaron S is writing about Don Lemon. I can't believe that I had to defend Don Lemon yesterday. Well, Aaron says, I'm not offended with what Don Lemon said at all. He can have his opinion. However, I disagree with him and Candace here. What I want a 50 to six year old as president or 20 to 30 year olds, I think a healthy 50 to six year old would be a prime candidate for president. Someone with more life experience and wisdom, not to mention any children that they might have would probably be grown, which is a benefit. I could not trust a 20 to 30 year old to be president. No way. Of course, women are physically in their prime 20 to 30 years old, which is also the prime time to have children. I do agree with Candace at the overreaction of what he said is absurd. I don't disagree with you. And this gets into the argument. What he's talking about is a biological peak. What you are referring to is not biological. You're talking about the fact that you are wiser in your later years, which is why I look forward to aging. I talk about the fact that I hated my twenties, right? I was in my biological prime, but I hated my twenties. I was anxious. I didn't know what I was going to do in life. I didn't know who I was going to be married to, the dating scene, not knowing, throwing away money on rent. There was nothing to me that was enviable about being in my twenties. And now that I'm in my thirties, I may not be in my biological prime anymore, but I'm a happier person. I'm a more well-formed person. I have a lot more experiences and I became wiser. So we all know that as you age, you become wiser. I mean, my grandfather, before he started dealing with dementia was one of the wisest people that I ever knew. I used to speak to him for advice all the time because he had seen it all. But he wasn't in his biological prime. And I think that's the point is that we are agreeing that people can be healthy in their fifties and in their sixties and that we would much rather have a healthy 50-year-old, a six-year-old than have a 21-year-old person running the country. But it does not in any way negate that what Don Lemon said is true, that in terms of your mental and your physicality, you are not in your prime when you are in your fifties. And as I said yesterday, I think that all they had to do was offer him a healthier bottle just like you didn't ask the question, would you prefer a 21-year-old? How old people people when they run? And to also say that yes, people begin declining mentally and physically in their fifties, but they don't suffer a steep decline, which tends to happen in their eighties, which is what Biden is suffering from in this moment. Moving on, this is regarding the Sam Smith backup dancer who did the video for me on TikTok and he used that term on a live. I just thought it was just really funny. Telbell agrees. She writes, unalived. I'm not doing it. I'm not using any more stupid, reinvented words like baby mama, baby daddy and unalived. And as a gay man, I don't believe demonic symbology can be used in a positive way. These people are doing the greatest harm to the rest of us that just live our lives like normal people. Sorry, I've said she writes. She was obviously a he and I couldn't agree with you more there. As you all know, I hate colloquialisms. When I use them, I tend to be mocking us because I just think it's ridiculous. We just keep shortening the English language and it's getting worse because of TikTok generation. This is how they talk. They think it's cool and the majority of them cannot form complete English sentences. And so I think it's cool to be uncool. I'm at that point in my life. I'm at 33. I think it's cool to be uncool. Sarasosa on the same topic writes quote, I hope you read a book one day. LOL, he really thought he ate. Obviously, he didn't read any books specifically the Bible. Hundreds and hundreds of years for hundreds and hundreds of years. Queer people have been told to be unalive or something. It was ridiculous. It was funny. And we are all better because he made that video. So kudos to him. He made us all laugh. I appreciate it. All right, guys, you know how this works. The next portion of the show is going to be available exclusively on Daily Wire Plus. The benefits, there are no bleeps on Daily Wire Plus. We don't have to bleep anything.
