do that why it's our only hope and folks this is gonna be a show this show is gonna demonstrate to you why this program is one like none other we're gonna take you on a tour of five six seven states to just get a sense of what's going on what I'm either dealing with or observing so there is a lot on the agenda today there's lots of stuff going on in the courts again the two most important things for us to do is to get the red states to actually break off in a way not necessarily succeeding but doing their own thing you control a unique unit of government within a state you can do whatever you want and then the next step is to fight back against the courts and just say no just like the blue states do what they want we're gonna do it what we want you guys don't get involved in blue state stealing elections well you can't get involved in us dealing with life liberty and property saw the Ninth Circuit yesterday said there's no right to carry a gun anywhere anytime anyway the same bastard courts that believe that there is a right for cartels to crash our border there is a right for taxpayer funded Medicaid funded transgender castration there's a right for a man to play in a female college athletics program these same courts believe there is no right for religious liberty there is no right for self-defense there is no right to breathe without a diaper on your face these are illegitimate courts and it's time for red state governors to stand up to them so we are gonna start with South Dakota and we're gonna move on to Ohio Wyoming Arkansas Texas Tennessee New Hampshire if we have time a lot going on the first a word from our sponsor today Patriot mobile the biggest problem we have is that the left has a monopoly on vital goods and services as we've seen and how do you escape their cancel culture one thing you can do is cancel your big provider because Patriot mobile now has you covered with dramatic expansion of their coverage area without donating your money to leftist causes I'm proud to partner with Patriot mobile which is America's only Christian conservative wireless provider you can switch to them obviously with much less charge you could keep your phone number or bring your own phone buy a new phone build a bundle with multi-line discounts go to Patriot mobile comm slash CR or call their US base customer service team at 972 Patriot that is 972 Patriot veterans and first responders save even more this month you can get free premier activation where they set up the phone for you and a special gift with the offer code CR as in conservative review that's Patriot mobile comm slash CR comm slash CR offer code CR or or 972 Patriot to break away from the communist wireless providers now folks there's a lot going on here let's start with South Dakota as I mentioned yesterday and throughout the week what I do like about what's going on in South Dakota is finally conservative media is waking up like wait a minute we don't have to worry about Democrats controlling Washington we have an entire state where we could end the transgender agenda house Senate with super majorities and a Republican governor Republican Attorney General and they have that in about half the states so you know what why in the world are we on the sidelines so they're finally getting on the sideline getting on the playing field but as always as you guys well know I'm a stickler not just for focusing on the right issues but focusing on the right points and lessons within the issue and too often this gets sidetracked with personalities like as if we're putting governor Kristi no Montreal is she bad is she good defending or not it's not about Kristi no I like her I have nothing against her you know the her office said that that we're trying to do conservative cancel culture and her we're not cancel anything we're debating a policy issue but what it's more emblematic of the fact that people now realize a the power of governors and mayors and state governments how we could take back our country just with the areas where we have super majority Trump voters but the politicians don't reflect those values it's not just Kristi no if you're gonna take the lesson for me or Kristi no miss terrible we need someone new and and I don't mind getting someone new but just realize 90% of Republicans are like that the state Senate in South Dakota is awful half the Republicans are a bunch of leftists and there's a reason for that we have to address the systemic problem that you have the Chamber of Commerce and big business that is totally in bed with the open borders rainbow jihad you know cultural Marxist de-civilization agenda in every state in other words the Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce that's pushing this agenda you know let's face it Kristi no miss coming up with these retroactive arguments that she never argued before when she supported the bill was never involved with but then when conservatives pushed back she needed like a way to kind of jujitsu it and say like hey you know I'm really playing the long game like okay what's your game work with other states okay to do what title 9 yeah meaning what like I read this article Kristi no I'm playing the long game and PJ Media and and I wanted to read I was like hey well what's the strategy and I literally cannot even articulate I don't know what it is meanwhile you have some of these conservative hosts that are like a bunch of muppets like oh Kristi no I'm yeah long game long game dude if you would understand the background of how this bill came about like you would get it well Daniel like she doesn't have the ability to fight these just to fight it more carefully you know all the NCAA is gonna come in from all these different states dude she blocked the bill a year ago simply prohibiting hospitals from doing castrations and mutilation hormone therapy on minors that's totally in state you don't have any of those excuses here don't apply what's the common denominator she won't fight the tranny agenda is it because she loves it I doubt it it's because she's scared of the chamber or commerce and all the forces around it so that's the thing like they're getting sucked into the details they're missing the broader point I don't care if it's up if it's like you know an immigration bill designed to demagnetize the state from illegal immigration I don't care if it's a covid fascist bill if it's a limited government bill anything you are going to have the for the same forces are gonna align against you and the same you know Kristi no mr. Staph is on the board of the Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce but again this is true of all of them in every state I'm I'm monitoring so many states and I'm seeing the same story it's not just South Dakota it's not just Kristi no it's not just this issue it's not just this strategy it's all of it so if we don't apply counter pressure meaning you have the big conservative voices give voice to the big good efforts going on in these areas that leadership is stifling the bad efforts that the establishment Republicans are putting if you don't have our Liberty Strike Force teams from con action. Network you could sign up that we're gonna get into place to have Minutemen part of a Liberty Strike Force team that could be ready at a minute's notice 30 40 people in each region of the state to pressure their legislators pressure their county officials pressure the governor educate the people on the good bills and the bad bills and the effects of them right into media social media do radio focus on lawsuits hit them from every point that's what the left does if we don't create a parallel movement the red states are gonna be no better than the blue states but if we do there's a lot of things that can be done and we're gonna talk about some success stories as well as a lot of problems but the problems all arise because we are not focused on where we need to be focused the muppets that are defending Kristi Noem's state get-together bridge to nowhere are missing the broader point that Kristi Noem's broader rhetorical strategy is correct that we need to synchronize 23 or so red states at a time to pet but not for some get-together committee but to pass the same legislation to pass HP 1217 to pass things like Arizona's SB 1070 from last decade that needs to be reiterated and passed in every state to block illegal immigration and on and on we can go through every issue so that way you're not isolated that way you're not isolated in the courts that way you get some of the good circuits but ultimately you need to tell the courts to go to hell and it's a lot easier for half the country to do that than one state but this is what you have in the leadership of the conservative movement let's face it some of the top voices they don't understand legislation they don't understand policy they just work based off of relations people come to them oh you know our traditional good ideal and the muppets just buy into it it's how all these phony conservative figures bought into jailbreak and the Soros D incarceration agenda we don't buy into that here because we do our homework so that's what's going on in South Dakota but keep in mind if we had this degree of pressure on every governor let's go on to Arkansas okay Arkansas is a state where Republicans like 20 other states they have these super majorities they have a 67 no more than that they have a 78 to 22 majority in the house they have something like a three to one majority in the Senate 78 22 I want you guys to keep that in mind that's a hundred seats where else do we have a hundred seats the United States Senate okay imagine having 78 Republican senators well if we don't get our act together and elect the right people and and then more importantly pressure them and raise awareness to both to the public and to the legislators being pressure the inside inform the outside that's what our Liberty Strike Force teams are gonna do hey there's this opportunity to override a veto there's this bill going on there's this committee hearing way in on this amendment if you don't do it guess who is engaged 365 days a year the health departments the governor's staff the Chamber of Commerce the tranny rainbow jihad lobby and and and they they threatened legislators physically even you know legislator told me I'm from Idaho she told me the other day when she was pushing back on the transgender sports stuff they had some of these guys you know the state troopers called her up and said hey we're gonna escort you home we have some information that they're gonna come after you this is a big problem they put a lot of pressure including illegal violent pressure on them we don't even know what's going on so I forgot to mention this yesterday but in Arkansas we had SB 301 what it simply did is zeroed out retroactively all the fines that the alcoholic beverage control division collected against restaurants and businesses okay it's zeroed it out and this is something any Republican worth anything should agree to it violated property rights it violated science every single study has shown that bars and restaurants were a false bogeyman they did not contribute more to the spread than Walmart or Home Depot in Kansas they showed just 0.91% of cases emanating if you could even believe their contact tracing study from bars and restaurants resulting in zero deaths CDC data has shown no increase in cases from dining services once they reopened they studied it it's a false it's another one of these false premises that they're stuck on stupid and they continue repeating them after all the studies have disproven it so the house passes it 67 20 okay that's that's almost 3 and a half to one Senate passed in 1914 they lost some Republicans but they still passed it now again Arkansas is a type of state where you could override the governor's veto with a simple majority that they had a super majority in the house simple journey in the Senate on Tuesday dirtbag governor Aisa Hutchinson vetoes the bill here's like this sends a bad message that you know you could just be a lawless and and the legislature is just gonna get in the way of us enforcing the law it literally flips it backwards he legislates against the bill of rights and the legislature gets back on the playing field is like hey stop being lawless the same thing that New Hampshire governor Chris Anuno mentioned when the state house also voted on something similar to zero at the fines so anyway he vetoes it Tuesday now mind you how many patriots in Arkansas even knew this was going on we're a prize of it see we're gonna have a group in place once we get it set up where we can immediately have drive 50 100 calls into the offices of the governor the relevant committee chairs in both chambers alert the people get on talk radio this is what we need I shouldn't have to be doing this in every state but you know where there's no leadership a guy's got a you got to fill it we should believe be be playing a home field advantage game in the right states instead we're always playing an away game because the other side operates so you know I honestly didn't work this hard there was a very short timetable you have to remember the legislative process in state legislatures works lightning quick and unlike Congress there's really is not a lot of media focus on it very little but this is what affects our lives more than anything so Tuesday he vetoed it Wednesday both chambers within minutes of each other had veto overrides very quick there was no layover period very quick now I didn't focus on it because I was like look you know it passed by a mile you only need 51% to override so this should be great well the Senate you know on cue over road his veto 1913 they didn't lose a single person who voted for the bill which is what you expect I mean usually if you vote for a bill governor vetoes it well if you voted for it you're gonna override his veto now remember the house passed it 67 to 20 you only need a simple majority yet the veto override failed 39 to 40 and then a bunch of these cowards voted present so I never saw this in my entire career but basically the governor was able to flip 29 Republicans from passage to an override vote no one was on the playing field I exposed I tweeted out a list of the Republicans that voted against it but you better believe the governor staff was on that phone whipping them how many calls were driven to these members say you better stand up for our businesses I can't attest to it I don't know but I doubt there were very many because I doubt very many people even knew this was taking place this is what this is what sets me apart from my colleagues I'm trying to actually focus on where we can make a difference we can't make a difference in Washington now we can't make a difference in my state of Maryland it's very sad today is um March 25th is the anniversary of Maryland's founding it was the leader of Liberty had the first bill of rights and now it's a toilet there's nothing you can do in Maryland but there's a lot of states where you know you get majority conservative districts and they call up and they're representative say this is what we expect you to do I'm not gonna say it's gonna work a hundred percent of the time but right now it's working zero percent of the time because we're not even trying and then likewise if they do vote no now you alerted the people and they do it enough they'll be right for a primary challenge so it's kind of a win-win but this demonstrates the focus and by the way I'm hearing that Governor Christie Nome is trying to whip Asa Hutchinson to to I forget the number of their bill but Arkansas has a sports bill too you know barring men in female sports and he's trying to get him so rather than this promise of getting states to work together she's actually having reverse energy trying to get states to go against the bill so she doesn't feel alone the exact opposite of what needs to take place but again Arkansas voted for Trump by a mile very red trending state 78 to 22 majority in the house 27 to 8 majority in the Senate and this is what we have we have it because we are not engaged at a local and state level in the areas where we constitute the majority we need to get on the playing field that's Arkansas let's move on to Wyoming in Wyoming the house voted yesterday 32 to 28 32 to 28 to expand Medicaid there are one of the states holding out the governor is pushing it and likely will pass I'm assuming will pass the Senate this the Republicans have become the party of Medicaid the Republican vision on health care is nothing more than the what the Democrats vision was a year ago this is what it is I've written a lot on Medicaid all it does is line the pockets of the insurance cartel that administrative the hospital cartel horrible care doesn't do good for anyone bankrupts us distorts health care so many better ways of doing it just giving people a voucher money to go out and purchase their own plan in a in a market that we need to make freer with options and choices that will spawn competition but that's that's your Republican party for you there are two Republicans in the Wyoming Senate sorry Democrats Democrats left Wyoming Senate there are seven Democrats left in the Wyoming House but they got 32 votes that means 25 Republicans joined okay 25 Republicans joined in that is almost half a little bit less than half so you get 45% of the Republicans joining with the freaking marginalized seven Democrats and you turn an insane super majority into a minority because we don't have anyone on the playing field when you're talking about Medicaid you cannot imagine the lobbies you're talking about the AHA the AMA ARP the entire big pharma the entire health care and insurance cartel if you don't get on the playing field you could be in a 99 one Trump district but the policies will reflect the values of the one because they have the pressure they have it the lobbying we need to lobby for liberty we are our best advocates we are our only advocates again Wyoming for whatever reason it's the only red state we barely have anyone signed up we only have three people signed up so if you are listening from Wyoming sign up at con action.network if you are offering to be a team leader to help form the team we badly need it so they had time to expand Medicaid but have not yet denuded the health department of its power and the governor of this power I don't want to hear all the got rid of the mass mandate no they didn't it's in all the schools it's in many localities it's the big lie in all these states so that's the story with that and by the way Wyoming also there was a bill by my friend Chuck Gray in the house he's also running against Liz Cheney for Congress to fire the health director and subject the future health director to Senate confirmation very modest reform if we're gonna have this dictator shouldn't the Senate vote on the person it was voted down voted down by Republicans Wyoming is a house full of muppets it is disgusting utterly disgusting bunch of communists running the state so that is the story let's see where else we're gonna go I could go on and on this problem is everywhere so Texas let's go on to Texas we have a border bill okay HB 2862 what if I told you that you could literally from a Republican controlled state influence the arc and trajectory of one of the greatest policy issues of our time border security the border invasion imagine if Texas would start building the border wall don't complain to me about where the state's gonna get the funding the the sponsor Brian a slaton representative in the house he told me his office is already getting people mailing him money I mean he never asked for it he's sending it back because he can't do that they don't have a fun setup but they could set one up controlled by the state people badly would want to fund that people would donate I would venture to say if Texas wanted to they could probably funded a hundred percent from private donations across the country and that would embarrass the Biden administration it would force the issue okay again the power of Republicans controlling state governments like and Daniel we don't have enough power this it's a garbage they have solid trifecta's and majorities all of the place but in this case they have the trifecta in two of the most critical border states Arizona and Texas so Brian Slaton introduced HP 2862 I'm gonna have an action item for you right now to give you an example of what is not happening why we lose but what could easily happen this bill was recommended to the committee of state affairs it is Ron by the chairman Chris Patty that's PADDI he's from the far east border of Louisiana area he let let me just say is not exactly excited about having a committee hearing on this and if it is left in his hands it will likely die and it won't go anywhere and no one will ever even know this was introduced and that this is an option I need you guys who live in Texas to call up Chris Patty and say hey I hear HP 2862 is gonna build the border wall it's in your committee hey when's the committee hearing I'd like to come and testify we need to do this now you got to complete the wall especially the half baked half constructed wall when's it coming up for a hearing we have thousands of listeners from Texas that's by far our biggest state turns of listenership could you imagine if Tucker Carlson would do this if Sean Hannity would do this Laura Ingram would do this and do this on a regular basis a random state legislative committee chairman they're not used to that that would really have its effect this is just one of many things I'd like to do another good bill on the Senate side from Senator Bob Hall SB 1254 that bill would create a cross-state compact between Texas and any state willing to join to try to deal with illegal migration together I think this is a good way that there's a lot of smaller things you can do and I'm gonna start writing about that but eventually I want to just have deportations where the right state say look you violated the Constitution and invade us and don't protect us from invasion Article 4 section 4 we have the right to protect our jurisdictional sovereignty our territorial sovereignty now we're not going to engage in foreign affairs we're not going to deport them to Mexico we're going to deport them to the blue states you guys want them so go have them I'm not saying that's what this the intent of the author of this bill what it does but this type of thing is how we're going to eventually get there so Texas is very important but absent that Texas is garbage so I need I have an east and Texas state leader I need a committee of really intensely focused people who are smart have connections understand the legislative process and have a lot of time to donate to the cause to work with our two guys we have so far to form the various teams at a minimum we want four teams east west north and south I mean really if you got fancy you could do a lot more there's a lot of different regions of Texas but we'd start with four we already have 170 people signed up so you know I really want to get moving on that and once we promote it God knows how many we're gonna get but we need a committee to kind of really handle that before I give over the names to our various team leaders but folks I mean this is what we should be thinking about a guy like Chris Patti is he serving you well in a very conservative part of Texas does he share your values and by the way isn't aside one of the things I am gonna be pushing so most these states are past their funnel deadline we can't introduce legislation which is nonsense their chamber rules that leadership always violates for their bills whenever they want to they could it the bottom line is if you're a speaker of the house Senate president you could do what you want okay but nonetheless one of the ways to get around that is to stick some of our priorities in budget bills the annual budget so that's one of the things we're looking at because this especially is primarily a budget thing really allocating funding to build a wall more than a policy it's a budget issue but here's another problem do you know that the woman who is the subcommittee chairman who would oversee this at house appropriations her name is Mary Gonzalez she is a Democrat who calls herself a pansexual I didn't even know so this is the P I told you there's something for every letter of the alphabet yeah I think it means like she could switch hit any any given days could be a different letter of the alphabet so one day she's a T one day she's an N one day she's a L whatever in Texas because Republicans gave half the committee chairmanship to the Democrats mentally ill this is what they do fun fact Brian Slaton the sponsor of this bill is the guy who had the first day of the session this year filed a motion to end that practice and of course leadership shot it down mentally ill they're like well Democrats back in the 80s gave us you know when they control when Texas was a Democrat state they gave us the champions dude that was in a different era when we weren't in political warfare like this believe me if the Democrats got control that chamber in the year 2021 they ain't given Republicans have to give me the chairmanship but this is what we have let's move on let's move on Tennessee so remember we had this anti-discrimination bill we're simply speaking businesses cannot discriminate against people for not being vaccinated and not wearing a mask well that bill has now been watered down because people just these sophomists conservatives just couldn't wrap their arms around a mandate on a business which is nonsense as I mentioned many times so therefore they gutted it so to begin with it's going to be you know watered down much more than than it would have been so it allows businesses to basically set their policy the one thing it does do is at least it applies disability law so if you have a meta if you say you have a medical exemption then they wouldn't be able to challenge that arrest for proof generally they can force you to wear a mask but so it's watered down and look that would be pretty substantial but I'm sure it's gonna be watered down more but again this is where you need to get on you know with Tennessee it's very very important by the way as an aside you have Jack Phillips the Baker in Colorado so now listen to where where we are in this country so basically if you're a business owner you have to bake a sentimental cake like something that's with you know it has a message it's speech you cannot deny service to a cause that violates your conscience okay remember none of these people are saying I'm not gonna service someone who calls himself transgender or whatever it just I am not going to service that message okay so it's not the person you're even discriminating against you would give him any other product that you make I just don't make that product I don't make a coming out as trans whatever that means blue and pink cake and I'm not gonna make it for you when mind you he can go to every other place and get it but we could have every business in the entire country box out a human being for not covering his mouth you're not asking for any specific type of product you say you have to cover smother your breathing oh Daniel business could do what they want dude let's go back to 1789 when a business was able to do what they want and not have anti discrimination law then I'll agree with you until then I'm not playing that one-way game especially when this only came about through government censorship and lying and mandates that lied about mass no we're gonna fight fire with fire but nonetheless all the principal conservatives I hate that man do I hate that but anyway this is SB 0320 HB 0794 in Tennessee the the medical non-discrimination businesses and consumer act okay I gave you a lot of bad news here's some good news Ohio Ohio yesterday unlike Arkansas the overrode de wines veto both in the house in the Senate SB 22 is the law of the land now unfortunately because of Ohio's constitution no bill that doesn't get two-thirds majority could be enacted immediately so there is a three-month layover but we do have a permanent reform allowing you know limiting the duration of the emergency to 30 days or maybe it is 60 days but the orders that are promulgated based on emergencies could be immediately nullified by a simple majority concurrent resolution I give senator Ron McCully a lot of credit for the tenacity of really keeping the conference intact and getting most of the rhinos on board with something as monumental as overriding the veto of a Republican who's officially from your own party that's good news to one is weakened and that portends a lot of good news with better leadership in the state Senate there's a lot more that I think can be done in the future Ohio is a full-time legislature so there's a lot we can do to introduce all the ideas that unfortunately in a lot of states it's too late to introduce so that's great news there that weakens them folks if you are in Ohio I would suggest don't call Warren Davidson's DC number but call his field offices in Ohio and tell the staff you want Warren Davidson to run for governor okay just trust me trust me on that I think he's considering it if he runs based on the trajectory of the state the the um the fact the legislature is getting better there's a lot of good things that could be done in Ohio again you know you run a guy for Senate US Senate there's nothing here they can do you run a guy for governor especially where the legislature is getting better and we put in Liberty Strike Force teams we can make Ohio a microcosm of freedom independent from the rest of America that is my end goal let's move on to New Hampshire we have a terrific listener to this show who is in the New Hampshire House I think we have a few people but there was one I spoke to yesterday and she apprised me some good news that the legislature finally had enough of rhino governor Senu no and they're actually sticking a bunch of good stuff in the budget so the House Finance Committee crafted the budget and they stuck in it provisions first of all defunding all critical race theory that bill HP I think 544 that the governor said he'd veto so they're sticking it in the budget bill to force him to either shut risk a government shutdown or have to sign it because remember in New Hampshire they don't have super majorities they have simple majorities so they can't override his veto and they also stuck in the emergency powers reform limiting his power they stuck in their bill zeroing out all the health department fines that have been levied so that's something to watch but it's also a model we need to push in these other states so if they say well the deadline already passed we can't introduce this bill put it in the budget and I don't want to hear this sophistry of like Daniel this is a budget bill it's not appropriate to legislate in a budget bill well you know what it's not appropriate to violate life liberty and property and for a governor to legislate from the executive branch so you know what in the legislature where they have both the power to legislate and the freaking power of the purse yes we're gonna stick legislation in the power of the purse budget bill to preempt or fight back against executive constitutional violations I'm sick of this sophistry I'm sick of these excuses all these excuses that you know we'll be like in Guantanamo Bay with duct tape tied to a mask on our mouth and nose and we'll have like some way of cutting the fence to escape and they'll find some principled reason not to do it don't ever let them give you stupid process excuses when we're fighting civilization battles constitutional violations budget bills this is again these last 30 minutes I want to serve as a presentation of what we can do I'm just one person but if we have a hundred people in each state who listen to this show who are active and have a lot of time to donate to volunteer and to serve as a cohesive organized strike force team to do the lobbying and the and the advocacy the pressure the education the social media the earned media paid media writing on all of these legislative issues and I didn't even get to county issues the sky is the limit to what we can do in states where we have the majority and then eventually you'll either force these phony Republicans to start getting with the program or it'll be a lot easier to primary them I don't know if our civilization is too foregone for even my solutions I don't know if even my solutions perhaps don't speak to the gravity of the situation we live in but they're worth trying because we haven't tried it until someone shows me something better it's better than hearing from anyone else so that is where we are right now now there's a lot of other stuff that I do want to get to but I wanted to give you this sense of you know what is going on in these states this one more important bill I want to shed light on that speaks to the core of COVID fascism so as you all know what these evil vermin did is lie to us about the fact that you could avoid getting the virus took away our liberty took away our humanity to socialize to to show our faces destroyed the lives of kids destroyed the dreams of small business owners destroyed our economy all for interventions that did nothing nothing to stop anything you know I'm Marty Macquarie the Johns Hopkins professor that's been writing some Ralshee journal op-eds on herd immunity he just wrote today that he agrees with me that when you see in LA there's 45% seroprevalence it's likely means by now it's well over 50% in Los Angeles all of their things failed to stop the spread and they're lying about immunity natural immunity they're lying about mass they're lying about asymptomatic spread everything imagine flushing down all that money life streams life's experiences for nothing that's pretty bad but then it's a step worse there is one thing we can do taking prophylactic regimens and certainly certainly early therapeutic treatment once you know you have the virus of some sort of mixture depending on who you are your health status I've remekt dinner hydroxychloroquine mixed with azithromycin and certain steroids obviously prophylactic regimens of vitamin D vitamin C zinc kerstatin some other things imagine if that would have been done we would have saved 85% of the people who died we would have precluded almost everyone from ever having to go to the hospital we would have precluded the impetus and the pretext for all these tyrannical destructive non-pharmaceutical interventions we would have saved mental health we would have enabled elderly people to really interact and continue with their lives by taking prophylactics and you know what else happens when you're when you're taking prophylactics against the virus and not getting it you're not spreading it either if you're not getting it it's it's a tool of source control and yet these subhuman bastards that say covid is the most important thing in the history of humanity and it pushes off its super seeds every human experience and every liberty are blocking and censoring the information and the ability of doctors to even prescribe this type of stuff so commensurate with the degree that they believe covid is a danger is the degree of culpability that god in his heavenly court will hold them accountable for blocking it is one thing if you don't think covid's a big deal and they're like whatever they're the ones who say it's the worst thing ever so they are the ones that are culpable for blocking the one thing that helps now i believe that this stuff should be over the counter but you know that's a little bit scary for some of these cowardly legislators to do Colorado state rep Stephanie Luck l u c k she has a bill hb 21 1202 entitled off label use of approval drugs to treat covid 19 and basically what this does is it addresses the lack of patient options both for prophylaxis and for at home early stage therapeutic treatment the problem is doctors are hesitant to prescribe because and pharmacists are hesitant to to dispense a friend of mine spoke with a pharmacist like who told you about our vermectin off label whoa like you know so what this does i mean you have administrative agencies medical boards that are regulating controlling their licenses threatening them so this bill specifies that a physician or any equivalent like like a whatever nurse practitioner may prescribe prescribing dispense and a pharmacist may dispense therapeutic drugs drugs for off label use including hydroxyl chloroquine sulfate and ivermectin to provide either prophylaxis or outpatient at home or inpatient treatment to an individual of covid 19 or someone who doesn't want to get it and the practice will not be deemed as unprofessional conduct or otherwise grounds for discipline it shocks me this bill should be the law in every republican legislature colorado is controlled by the left i don't know what's going to happen with it so anyone who tells you call up your state reps if you're in a republican legislature talk about this bill and say how dare you have all these regulations on our life under the guise of protecting from covid spending billions of dollars when we have cheap cheap prophylactics that people can't get a hold of and if they have a sort of process excuse say excuse me this is an emergency you're doing you're saying it's an emergency to cover our damn nows to regulate our businesses to sh to put duct tape on the nows of our kids for seven hours so you know what it will be an emergency enough for the muppet senate president or house speaker to suspend the stupid chamber rules and introduce the bill or put it in the budget i love it it's like you could move heaven and earth for tyranny but for some in this not even liberty it's not even there's nothing right wing or conservative about this bill it actually takes covid series and says look why wait until people don't have an option other than like very tenuous treatments and ventilators we know inflammatory reactions we know super infection we understand cytokine storm and thrombosis you let that get out of hand it's very hard to treat but you stuff it in the hole it will work every time these are not novel elements and we have treatments for them it's got to be done early at home this there's nothing right wing or conservative about what i am saying right now putting aside masks and vaccines and this and that whatever they are literally using vaccines that aren't even vaccines their their mRNA gene therapies experimental emergency use authorization when we have drugs that have been dispensed since the 1970s four billion doses and no adverse effects no adverse effects the safest drugs you can imagine folks i wanted to give you guys just the flavor of what i want to do with constitution action network again you can sign up op at con action dot network what i'm trying to do to salvage the red states to make state legislatures great again to focus on getting good governors in to have a standing lobby for liberty lobby for civilization for common sense for family values for civilization values for basic humanity we're not even fighting for conservatism anymore this is stuff that the left wasn't even doing until ten minutes ago you get a sense of what this show is about what my movement is about so i ask you to pass this show on to everyone you know give us a five-star review on iTunes the show should be on spotify now we just got on there where we've been on stitcher and google play for a while obviously folks our future is in our hands at least in areas where we are the voting majority we can't say that we're out of options if we don't even try them there are a handful of groups in a handful of states for a handful of issues sometimes trying to do this but no one is doing this often enough as emphatic enough in enough places on enough issues this is at its core my message make red states red again make state legislatures great again make our voices heard again empower inform educate the public pressure and educate republican members of legislative bodies in red states you do that and folks we're going to start seeing results nothing's perfect it's not going to work every time but it's kind of like i've remecked in hydroxychloroquine versus a ventilator when that phlebotomus told my wife his doctor told him it's either the vaccine or a ventilator i was like that is sick we have cheap easy reliable options early on it's the same thing politically our choice is not just you know vote for flasted republicans or die and nothing you know we have nothing to do there's a lot we can do it's in our hands so again as always we left a lot on the tables a lot of covid news i wanted to get to um obviously there's a lot of news on the war on whites were on asians going on we have a black supremacy problem in this country certainly not all blacks but there is a contingent of blm ferrican type of people that the media doesn't want to talk about and actually projects it upon everyone else it needs to be dealt with the border stuff needs to be dealt with we need to push title 42 again that needs to be the demand of the vitamin administration not better care at the facilities turn them around then you'll stop the humanitarian problem as well folks until tomorrow same time same place we'll be back here as always god bless y'all and thank you for listening"
