    "text": " Welcome back in Clay Travis, Buck Sexton show appreciate all of you hanging out with us encourage you to go give us a Five star review make fun of Buck scooter and there's probably a good chance that at some point I will end up reading it we also tweeted this out I think it's up on the clay and buck page as well We have loved our first six months with you guys since we started together in June and a lot of you are listening and responding very favorably to us as an article up Interview with buck and I that I think some of you will enjoy But the audience among adults up 46 percent nationwide Since we started back in June or number one in a buckets nervous when I brag But I'm like man, nobody else is going to do the PR for us So I want to let people know that we are winning Because when we win it means that the ideas that we talk about are advancing which is so significant But thanks sacramento san diego salt lake city to houston phoenix rolly milwaukee And and bermiham and also luival mimphis. I believe you can't even remember all the number one cities at this point Which is a good song all number one right now almost the whole country I believe we are joined now by marynda divine who has got a fantastic book out She writes at the new york post the book is called lap top from hell And uh, marynda. Thanks for taking the time to join us here I believe in the years ahead The collusion to cover up the new york post story on Hunter biden's lap top is going to be seen as one of the greatest failures in the history of independent american media Do you agree based on all the things that you've seen inside of this laptop and and and that was covered up How massive was this story and maybe more? wildly how massive was most of the media's cover up for this story Oh, you're absolutely right and thank you very much for having me on both of you kay and buck. Um, look I think We understood that um three weeks before the election when when we published the first Of the emails from the laptop that we're so damning of joe biden when you was at bomb shell And we expected that the new york times in the washington post and cnn and all this sort of um media organizations that were in the tank for joe biden that just would do anything to get rid of Donald trump we knew that they would ignore it, but what was so shocking was the power of social media of the big tech oligopolies facebook and twitter and within a couple of hours of Of our story going online at five a.m. october 14 um facebook could come out and said that they were blocking it Pending a fact check which still more than a year later has never happened uh, and Then twitter followed suit and locked the new york post accounts the next two weeks until a few days before the election And people couldn't even share the story in direct message um cali mccinannie who was the pro then president, um, you know press secretary she was Cancelled or suspended from twitter for trying to share the story It was really i'm sort of lost at the time, but when you look back now It was such a display of power and Such an intervention into the election by these faceless unaccountable Global corporatists that um, it's really frightening And you know shortly after that of course they deplatformed for sitting president of the united states and that prompted even a manual macron from france To say hello. This is this is rather frightening for all of us the whole world should realize That these companies have become more powerful than the leaders of countries And they they're still the same. I mean nothing's changed since then and we know um from polls taken after the election that Almost half of biden voters knew nothing about the scandal that was on the laptop The evidence of the influence peddling that was going on with joe biden The evidence that joe biden had met with hunter biden's business partners from overseas and was compromised in china and russia and elsewhere Um if they had known that about one tenth of biden voters would have changed their vote And so in an election that was won by 45 000 votes across a handful of battleground states The censorship of our story could have made a difference Absolutely marenda divine everybody laptop from hell is her book marenda. It's buck i Want you to look it's i was uh, you know i was at the the hill dot com when a lot of stories were being broken About the relationship with hunter biden and ukraine and you know, this has been around for a while We didn't have the laptop. We didn't have the laptop from hell What should people know because the the suppression story which clay started out with is enormous and may very well have likely did I believe change the the trajectory of the election and it was dishonest and a disgrace what the uh big tech and immediate Together what do people need to know about the corruption aspect of this? We always say if this were donald trump jr They might actually cover this more than the january 6th insurrection at cnn What did hunter biden actually do and where is the real corruption that we know of from this laptop? Well, the importance of the laptop is really not hunter biden who is this sort of tragic figure drug addicted for most of the nine years a laptop covered crackhead um The story is actually about joe biden and what the laptop tells you about his involvement in not just hunters but his younger brother jim's uh scheme around the world to monetize his power joe biden's power and what joe biden did in return for that money and how he financially benefited So, uh, we know that for the last two years of his vice presidency Hunter biden and his partners and jim biden were doing work overseas around the world Using joe biden's name to open doors and we know that that was being done with joe biden's okay imprometer uh full involvement and The money however was going to come after joe biden left office And this was why tony bobblinsky was brought in to become ceo of their latest joint Venture with china and sort of regularize and make everything You know squeaky clean because by that stage joe biden Um was a private citizen future president and you know, it wasn't just that the biden's were doing Business or had a joint venture with with someone in china They were in partnership with the company called cfc Which was the capitalist? Of president jeez belt and road initiative and this is the imperialist push by china into to you know corrupting buying up paying off Putting into servitude You know poor countries around the world and the biden's were involved They were using joe biden's name to help the chinese communist party Push into the rest of the world and you know at great Expense to the united states to america's national interest to america's national security and the other element i think Is there is some evidence to show that joe biden financially benefited? We know, you know hontobiden have been complaining about having to give half his salary to his dad Um, we know about you know An email saying 10 percent of equity in this private in you know This venture was going to be held by hontobiden for the big guy which Tony bob linsky says is joe biden and other It documents on the laptop show with joe biden But there's also evidence of commingling of finances between joe biden and hontobiden shared bank accounts shared debit cards Also, there's a little bit of evidence just the tip of the iceberg i imagine but it is there Showing that hontobiden was paying regular household bills for joe biden joe biden's always Made out that he is, you know the poorest man in congress. He's a really humble fellow from scranchin working class joe lunch pail joe But actually his lifestyle is a very champagne outfit, you know beautiful mansions great clothes He and his family lives a life of unimaginable luxury and privilege and whether it's cash Or it's just on trade to the best ivy league Places to government cinecures you name it whatever they wanted it with a magic carpet ride and joe biden was The hontobiden was paying some of the maintenance on the mansion whether it be painting or fixing a retaining wall or Fixing shutters or paying for a new air conditioning system in the cottage on the grounds that joe biden was charging the The secret service to rent Um, you know, it was expensive to have that kind of lifestyle and it seems that hontobiden was paying for it branda divine author of laptop from hell new york post writer as well branda is it fair to say based on everything that you have seen from this laptop and all of your research That everything the media said about donald trump and his son's joe biden was actually the one doing Ironically enough all of this russia collusion talk all of the china discussion All of the fear about the trump sons and the trump family in general that when you actually look at the data joe biden was doing everything that the media tried to tell us trump was doing Yes, absolutely Projection and in projection is the the psychological ailment of a lot of these democrats Um, they're always projecting onto people Racism or you know bad thoughts or bigotry which they harbor in their own hearts And it's the same with the russia collusion stuff. It i was so um shocked a couple of times when i was delving into this laptop that i had to push myself away from the desk and go off and just think about did i really just see this because hontobiden was right in the inner sanctum of Vladimir Putin he was hobnobbing in moscow with um Vladimir poutins oligarchs these corrupt people who were propping up the puttin regime And he would meet them at lake komo or or he would meet them in monticalo His partner one time said, you know, basically we're living the life of jason bawnd and james bond and they were these bumbling You know, he was a crackhead his uncle jim was just a bumbling moron and they were um, you know getting tens of millions of dollars from these people trying to curry favor with their father and Bumbling around the world in these luxury oligarch venues and uh, it just is so surreal So he was in with poutin and in with president g and there's this one Um, you know chapter in the book where i talk about this deal this incredible, you know multi billion D hunt dollar deal the biggest deal china had ever done um in in they were buying rosneft which was the russian state owned energy company and poutin had been forced into this by sanctions that were placed on russia by america and euro After that mh 17 plane was down over ukraine And so it was a reluctant marriage, but it was a great deal for president g and it was a marriage of russia and china that Just would have um altered the geopolitical energy balance And really put america on the back foot and only because donald trump came into office and started Told his attorney general jeff sessions just that uh disrupting chinese Influence and buying up of american property Um that that that final deal was knocked off because hunter biden's one of his partner was partners was arrested at jfk Um then president g got worried and he disappeared another one of hunter biden's partners So the whole was nephdial fell apart china had to pay russia Um, you know millions of dollars in compensation, but if it had gone through hunter biden was right at the center Of these and it would have had a huge effect on america and america's prosperity Randon divine labtop from hell is the book fastening stuff marena thanks so much for being with us and best of luck to you Thanks so much.

I mean We've had we've had we have we have great guests on the show We're the promise we always make do is we're just we're always trying to make sure that we make the best The best use of whatever time you're so kind and gracious to give us here on the eib every day And with guests we're just like is this somebody who is gonna really add and bring something to it right away I think we do a pretty darn good job of that maryna was fired up We got abigail shrier in the third hour tonight today, which is going to be also on the trans issue She's a liberal folks fearless on the trans agenda and what it is doing to children and the upens swimmer And we're gonna dive into all of that in a moment But you know clay it's interesting because the left increasingly Has adopted a pro censorship and I mean the democrats like the mainstream I don't like the term mainstream media so try to avoid that the Corporate legacy media, which is democrat aligned They try to suppress and shut people down. This is fascinating to me This was on cnn which I think is just an A dishonest enterprise and so far as it still pretends that it does objective journalism in any meaningful way And is not a democrat super PAC effectively Here's don lemon and brian stelter over at cnn talking about maybe they just shouldn't call on fox news anymore Why does jen saki even continue to call on fox in the briefing room and i'm being they're very they've been very courteous And I should say, you know kind because if your network is promoting vs and lies about What is actually happening in the country and helping to inspire and incite an insurrection? Why should they even be able to take part in a legitimate press briefing in legitimate journalism? Why do they even allow fox to pretend in the briefing room that they're a real news organization? What we have to do I think is I just want why do cnn get to pretend that it's Leave aside that duces the only one who asks real questions of the regime on a regular base Just there might be some others in there But I mean give me a break Here's the deal If you first of all fox news is destroying cnn and msnbc in ratings and their opinion programming dominates, but they have a lot of news programming and Peter duces is doing a phenomenal job of asking questions that almost no one else will actually ask and hold uh jen saki and joe biden and the administration itself accountable for many of the things they say which are outright lies or At an in most generous capacity are insanely hypocritical and without him I don't know that there's anybody in that entire press corps that would actually ask difficult questions of the biden regime. I really don't You know lately. I've been thinking more and more about protection protecting myself my property my savings I know how to protect myself and my property, right? That's become second nature for a long time But how about my finances the dollars in my bank account? That's why you would benefit from understanding the value of owning gold versus relying solely on that fiat currency out there That's why I've bought gold from the oxford gold group and i'm building up my holdings over time Look, I can say that I can hold it in my hand keep it in my safe and have it secure at home or even place it in my ira Should I choose to going forward? Many americans share the same concerns as you and me about this But they trust the oxford gold group and they should for their gold and silver needs The oxford gold group is here to help Reach out to the oxford gold group on the phone today to get real gold and silver delivered right to your home It's so easy call them at 833-404 gold That's an easy number to remember folks 833-404 gold Call the oxford gold group to answer all your questions get real gold delivered to your home 833-404 gold on the eib network you Walk back in clay travis buck sext and show appreciate all of you hanging out with us Great tuesday as we roll closer and closer to the christmas holiday Kamala Harris maybe the worst vice president in the history of the Last 50 or 60 years of presidency worth thinking about She is in charge of the border. She is the borders are Well jen saki was asked as part of this discussion. You are the borders are after all Kamala Harris Uh, you are responsible for many of the different things that are going on there um and uh borders are Kamala Harris Well, just listen to this jen saki gets set up Let it across the middle if you're a sports fan and absolutely wrecked Uh here on this question as she tries the defend Kamala. Let's play cut 12 listen to this his vice president Harris still in charge of addressing the root causes of migration from al-salvador pandoras and flautamala She isn't I just announced a commitment that she's announcing this afternoon Why is it that she has not spoken to the president of glautamala since june at six months I know that I did see this kind of strange report from the president of glautamala Saying that he has had no contact with the white house, which is inaccurate He said vice president Harris is not smoking that hurt and if she's in charge, why is that? Well, we have had a range of conversations beta I think as a reflected in our readout we put out last week with our national security advisor with the vice president's national security advisor With our ses senior director wangonzales We put out an extensive readout of that just last week and we'll continue that high level of engagement Clay high level. I mean I gotta tell you man Everybody who there are people who follow the border issue pretty closely. They tend not to be democrats Um, but anyone who follows it says the notion that it was a serious plan to begin with remember this Kamala was flying I just want to take everyone a little trip to a memory lane over mexico to get to central america basically Uh wouldn't go to the border then said we've been to the border to which Lester Holt I guess to his credit was like Look men on vice president like I can't you know You gotta actually go if you say you've been like you can't you can't get away with that But the notion that this root cause issue was serious You're gonna make you're gonna fly down and come up with some agreement that makes what people want to be in america instead of certain Central american countries because it's america and that is the root cause you know like that's exactly that's the we know So, you know, it's a as much as you know, the commies are running around trying to tear this place down and and all the rest of it It's still per capita a very wealthy place and a place where a lot of people Want to be and the way that you can actually deal with the border crisis is to change The calculation for people who want to come to the border, but there's also now what you could call the Kamala crisis For this white house, which is how do they make this vice president? seem like She's ready for the big job because that's always especially in a situation like this right you have a joe biden who I mean to be to be charitable. I know is mrs. Biden just waved off the whole he looks to be declining But I think we all recognize The notion this guy might run and be president for Another seven years from now. I mean deep deep into he's 86. Yeah, it was 86 years old I mean, this is like democrats are just being reckless. So and we all know it so Kamala is supposed to be up for the big job But I think that they realize they can't even have a coherent set of talking points to make it seem Like that's something the american people enough of the american people will go for you the san francisco chronicle Just did some puff piece. I think it was on the i didn't even i saw the headlines They had read it, you know the decorations and Kamala's office and yeah, they control Imagine if the media was 50 50 with the coverage of kamala would be like they got 95 percent of journos in their back pocket They might as well be I mean you might as well have the white house sending checks to cnn And msnbc and all these other channels And yet kamala's poll numbers are still tanking. How do they turn that or I don't know if they can turn it around is what they're realizing on some level your poll numbers become a reflection of Your perception and there's no way the perception of kamala harris is suddenly going to become Oh, she's really on the ball because when she went to those central american countries buck She said the phrase root cause Five times I believe it was in her limited Interaction with the media and the that's funny and embarrassing Simultaneously because as every single person there knows the root cause Of why people leave guatamala for the united states is because the united states is way better than guatamala, right? like the root cause of why Somebody decides to go to to become I don't know a Lawyer as opposed to a mechanic in general is probably because lawyers make more money, right? Like there's some some situations are not particularly difficult To analyze the root cause of why people come from central american countries is because america's better The reason why the overall number of people has sky rocketed buck is also really clear It's because joe biden has welcomed those people and many of them are showing up and saying that they believe the united states is Encouraging them to come across the border illegally find one area I mean, this is one of the challenges I have you know, I've said this about fauci and it's caught on with a lot of people Find me the one time he told people Enough don't do that that's silly. That's not helpful to calm people down. He never does it right? It's always you know more more wipe your groceries down triple mask your face, you know all this stuff He wiped his mail buck yeah for glysol Yes, which is insane and didn't even do anything fomite transmission as we've since we've all learned We've all been just on google, you know, dr. Google for the last 18 months or so Fomite transmission is not something in the beginning they were all freaked out about they shut down the new york City subway system clay overnight, which I think they hadn't done in over a hundred years In order to clean the train cars, which totally was a good idea. Yeah, just maybe did a cleaning Right I needed a good cleaning, but it didn't do anything about covid Um, uh, here's here's what I what I think We have to look at on the immigration issue There is not a single area of stricter immigration enforcement whether it's about Uh, expelling people from the country here illegally stopping people from coming into the country illegally I mean you look at sanctuary cities you look at what they just did in new york city where they're the city council is expanding And they've already done this in san francisco But I think it was for school boards not for the whole city wide but I can't keep up with what every city boards doing everywhere Uh, they've already given the vote in the in the city council, uh to illegal illegal immigrants legal aliens in the new york city area You will not find one part of this where you could actually start to enforce the law Which means changing the incentive structure for coming and being here illegally that democrats align with This is why I just said I mean they're they're four open borders. They just can't say it Because they need to Convince you know that middle slice of two to five percent of voters That oh no, we we're not actually for open borders Of all of the things that are a disaster for joe biden from a political perspective The border is where he pulls the absolute worst It's probably where the media has spent the least amount of time on two that's not a coincidence But joe biden has awful poll numbers Even for democrats when it comes to handling things at the border for independence. It's an unmitigated disaster Uh the border every time it flares up in any way Offers the opportunity to bring joe biden even lower because when you're talking about 35 36 37 38 Approval ratings there's not a lot of Of place that you can fall to your point earlier buck like the fear If you're thinking about midterms as biden is already so low that it's going to be hard for him to go lower The border is where he could go somewhat lower Not too late by the way to get a new iphone in time for the holidays You can get a pure talk iphone 12 starting at just $479 Through the end of the year and yes, they have the 13s too You can switch to pure talk where you'll get nationwide 5g coverage The same coverage as the big guy's average family saving over $800 a year Customer service here in the us you'll get hooked up with familiar voices inside the united states To help you make the easy switch from at and t verizon or t mobile and with a 30 day risk free guarantee you have nothing to lose unlimited talk tech six gigs of data just $30 a month buck how do people sign up from your cell phone dial pound 250 And say pure talk you'll save an additional 50% off your first month plus save on a new phone That's pound 250 Say pure talk some restrictions apply call for details Clay travis and buck sexton a new form of broadcast excellence inspired by rush on the eib network Welcome back to the clay travis and buck sexton's show 800 282 282 on those lines Abigail shry are be joining us in just a few moments if you don't know she is she's been on tucker show On the issue of transgender Essentially transgender psychological contagion as an issue among children Why are there so many more kids now who think they're transgender? It's going up by thousands of a percent Increase What's going on with that and she stands strong on the trans issue uh transgender uh agenda And also on the u pen Swimmer which now we're really seeing we're really seeing who lives in reality and who is willing to just Go with the narrative no matter what the cost to intellectual honesty I just think what's so interesting about it buck is we posted the article and did the interview with two different Pennsylvania swimmers And i'm not even seeing maybe i've missed it I mean if you guys see it you can uh you can DM me on twitter. I have open dms I haven't even seen any sports media figures Defend the idea of this transgender swimmer competing against women What's happening is most in sports media are just pretending this story doesn't exist Because they're afraid of what will be said if they really speak out But no one is saying hey this makes sense. This is a good thing. We should have more of this I'm not seeing it anywhere. I spoke to a friend recently who works in HR at a very well-known Very prominent financial services institution. I will say And as I said, you know what what kind of stuff is is really going on first of all it is as woke Wall street is as woke as any of these other corporations out there now Pronouns in the bio are highly recommended and remember it's not mandatory yet Putting your he-she they them z z You know, whatever it's not mandatory yet, but you are suspect if you don't do it. That's the whole point This is now wall street firms top corporate law firms in New York, los angeles chicago name a major city It is it is madness that is descending across the land Demetri I wanted to get to this call looked it looked really interesting demetri in houston, Texas Which of course one of our favorite favorite audiences is down there in kt r h land Demetri thanks for being here Thank you. I can't believe I got through It was a previous segment that it was funny that And the camel are being in charge of the finding the root causes for immigration from Guatemala Honduras el Salvador in all those countries like russia used to say el tavador But i'm glad that she found the roots and she's implementing him here this way by making this country a Crophole none of those guys want to come and live here No, it's 100% you're from the former you're from the former uss are you said you came here for freedom Correct. I can't hear right after his bilingual So I ran after mr. Gorbachev take down that wall. I was on the swimming team And I stayed over in needley and never went back I took advantage of that chaos between passports all falling down in parastryka. So hold i'm actually curious about this you were You were did you say you were on the swimming team? Yeah And so you were like competing in a foreign country and you basically in the midst of all that chaos just said Hey, i'm not going back and walked right out of uh walked, you know refused to leave the country in el t Correct. I I jumbled that we they took us with the bus We're back in a day. You do have like a you know a party leader and you have the coach in two outer champerons And everybody goes in one line and goes into the hotel and he goes to the event and everybody's like, you know walks in In the line so they can't hold the heads. So make sure that Nobody's in back in the that that that time certain passports became outdated And they had to use your son new passports. There was no database. There's no computers. There's nothing So I took advantage of that that the old passport was replaced by the new so I had two passports one was traveled only for For soviet union and the eastern european block and one was for Europe trouble to to european countries So did you just bail though like to everybody's lined up and you're supposed to be in a certain place that is Did you literally run like how did you make your escape? Right. I did I exited the back side of the hotel Wow Snuck out the back side of a hotel into europe because yeah your that the impast that first that first cappuccino on the streets of romer melon Demetri when you were escaped or freedom must have been pretty fantastic I should be first thing i ate is really pita at one of steincross pizza. We lives on them. There we go That's amazing. How much money did you have when you walked out the back door of the hotel 250 bucks 250 bucks and now you live in america It's the best decision. I bet you ever made to walk out the back door of that hotel Yeah, yeah, more than 30 years. I lived here in houston and And it's funny that you know they say what the quack about 30 years And it's in the basically be careful what you wish for you running from something and basically you see this deja vu 30 years later the same thing at marxism anywhere is a bad idea and people experience true authoritarianism Really love freedom when they have it like demetri demetri in houston. Thanks so much my man We'll be coming next year clan. I are hoping to get down to houston folks where we're talking about it We're trying to make some moves. We'll come see all of you folks Down in ktr h land and we got george in colorado wants to talk to me about the uh polis analysis governor polis analysis we had And of course we got him on 93 7 freedom in colorado there. What's going on? Hey guys, I just want to say thank you very much first of all for having me Um, I was listening to you guys's program earlier and uh you guys were kind of given a an assessment of the things going on in colorado And governor polis as a response to uh the mandates and with what he's been posed as far as the mandates when it comes to Uh private businesses and state employees Um, i'm calling as a former state employee and I will say that as I give him kind of passing gray on still giving us a choice Which is Which is great. It's still in my mind a wolf and sheep skin type of move And when you look at the type of uh conditions that we were forced into based upon um The decision making from higher ups within my agency during the onset of the pandemic last year It goes exactly against what uh these people are claiming to do it as far as their their claim Their false flag is sympathies And the problem about this is is when you work within the state agencies like such it It really operates like a mafia and if you have an opinion that deviation the line Don't be surprised if you uh, be wearing concrete shoes. I mean, I I don't want to say too many specific cases So it doesn't incriminate me Uh, not really so much incriminate me, but uh, you know kind of point me out within the But uh, you know, there's there's a lot of real muscle at all levels of of this and I think that we We've got to start figuring it out a way Um, whether we're right is left. It's whatever to be able to find common ground and come together Yeah, I think that's I think that's 100% correct and look I think buck hit on something which is significant What happened in virginia and nearly happened in new jersey in two states that were biden strongholds Has got people in colorado has got people in michigan places where there is an anti lockdown sentiment It's got those governors looking at the data and making more rational choices. I think than they otherwise might Speaking of rationality Abigail shrier joining us in a few moments here on the reality of the trans agenda that's coming up You're listening to clay travis and buck sexton on the eib network You"
