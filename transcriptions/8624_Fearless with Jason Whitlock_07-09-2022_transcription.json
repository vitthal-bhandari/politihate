    "text": " Bad government and bad policy can literally be deadly. Almost 100 people died in Hawaii's Lahaina fires. The most wildfire fatalities the country has seen in the century. But months on from the event, it seems like the media and local and federal governments would rather we all forget what happened. I'm Lauren Chen, and to uncover the truth about that day in the aftermath, including through exclusively obtained 911 calls, the Blaze and I travel to Maui for this first-ever Blaze original documentary. And this is just the start of Blaze Originals, a new docu series featuring your favorite Blaze TV hosts as we investigate the most important regions of our national theater covering groundbreaking issues and standing in the void left by the elimination of investigative journalism. Watch what really happened in Maui, a Blaze original streaming now on BlazeTV.com and use the code Lauren plus to save $36 off your annual subscription. The truth is Don Staley canceled South Carolina's women's basketball series with BYU to embarrass the Mormon institution and elevate her own profile. It was not a well thought out decision. It was emotional and manipulative. Staley should do the same to Memphis. Another school the gamecocks will meet in a home and home series. There's actual proof that the city of Memphis is unsafe for young black people and people in general. The city's murder rate rivals Chicago's and St. Louis's. Last year the mid-sized city recorded 346 murders. Don Staley needs to learn the story of Eliza Fletcher, the young mother kidnapped and murdered in Memphis. Welcome to Fairless with Jason Whitlock. I am Jason Whitlock your host Happy Wednesday to you and yours. It's a great day to be here in the Fairless studios because Shamika Michelle is here with me. She's in Memphis. Shamika you look awesome as always, always better in person. Fantastic show playing for you today. Of course Shamika Michelle is going to be here all day. TJ Mode, Delano Squires will join us. Pastor Anthony Walker will be here for some Tennessee Harmony. We'll review the movie, Honk for Jesus with Pastor and Harmony. And Virgil Walker is going to join us as well for that conversation. But we'll begin where we like to begin every show and that is with a fire. So let's get this party started. I wonder if Don Staley, the queen of women's college basketball, has heard the story of Eliza Fletcher. Cleotha Abstam, a career criminal, stalk, kidnapped and murdered the 34 year old school teacher on Friday. Fletcher, a mother and wife, was out on an early morning jog in her hometown of Memphis. One of the most dangerous cities in America. According to statistics, you have a 1 in 12 chance of being a victim of violent or property crime while living in Memphis. I wonder if Don Staley knows any of this. The South Carolina women's coach recently canceled the Gamecock's Home and Home series against Brigham Young University because a Duke volleyball player, Rachel Richardson, claimed BYU fans taunted her with racial slurs. Staley said, quote, I just wanted to make sure our players didn't have to endure that. Because if something happened in that manner, I don't have the words to comfort them. Really? BYU was scheduled to play at South Carolina on November 7. Next year, the Gamecock's were supposed to play at BYU. There's been no definitive evidence presented that the BYU crowd taunted Richardson or her teammates. The allegations first surfaced when Richardson's godmother, Lessa Pamplin, a political candidate in Texas, tweeted that Richardson was racially harassed throughout the entirety of a televised volleyball match. Pamplin has a documented history of making anti-white racial remarks and promoting racial hoaxes. BYU has a long history of hosting sporting events on its campus. The school's basketball teams have a long history of employing black players and assistant coaches. BYU is known for its homogeneous white campus. It doesn't have a reputation for using racial slurs at sporting events. Today, a group of state politicians in South Carolina, the South Carolina Freedom Caucus, wrote a letter to Staley, an athletics director Ray Tanner demanding the school explain its hasty decision-making, writing, quote, Why did the University of South Carolina cancel the series against BYU when no supporting evidence existed to warrant such action? Will the University of South Carolina reschedule with BYU and issue a public apology if the allegations continue to be shown as false? Is it now the policy of the university to forego or more concerning ignore any fact-finding missions into allegations of wrongdoing? Will the university be counseling all sporting events whenever any fan of any university against which the gamecocks have at an upcoming game is accused of acting inappropriately? Is the University of South Carolina now taking responsibility for all of its fans, regardless of any relationship with the university? What is the policy of the University of South Carolina for canceling games in which allegations of wrongdoing by a future opposing school's fans are made? And finally, will the University of South Carolina decline any games with Duke University, given the verifiable, racially insensitive tweets by a member of Duke's fan base, Miss Pamplin? The Freedom Caucus then made a series of Freedom of Information requests, seeking a paper trail to back up the decision to cancel the games. The Freedom Caucus has basically put Don Staley in South Carolina on notice that they want them to explain themselves and the irrational decision that just got made. Don Staley just flipped out because she's an emotional wreck and because she's privileged and Pamplin. South Carolina is the first school to counter a home game out of fear that the visiting team's fans would racially taunt their opponent. I guess Staley canceled the series out of fear of what might happen next year. Her players could be taunted. The truth is, Staley canceled South Carolina series with BYU to embarrass the Mormon institution and elevate her own profile. It was not a well-fought-out decision. It was emotional and manipulative. Staley should do the same to Memphis. This is actual proof that the city of Memphis is unsafe for young black people and people in general. The city's murder rate rival Chicago's in St. Louis' last year, the mid-sized city recorded 346 murders. For the first time in three decades, on December 3rd, South Carolina will play Memphis. It's a home and home series. Next year, the game cocks will travel to, you guessed it, Memphis. Where will Staley's game cocks face more danger? Provo Utah or Memphis, Tennessee? Based on the stats and reputation, stating the game cocks should bring extra security to Memphis. There's plenty of evidence that Memphis is quite dangerous for all people, but particularly black people. The tragedy that the fell, Elijah Fletcher, is just the latest example. Fletcher's white, but it's very dangerous there. A year ago, the rap world and corporate media celebrated the murder of young dolph, the nipsey hustle of the South. The rapper, say Memphis M E M F P H I S, stands for Making Easy Money Pimping Holes in Style. That's Memphis' reputation. Don Staley is comfortable taking a group of young women to Memphis, but not Provo. Staley is a hypocrite. Her hypocrisy is supported by corporate media. In 2018, the Missouri Tigers played at South Carolina. There was an on-court fight that appeared to be instigated by Staley's players. Sierra MacCylus, a former Mizzou basketball player, attended the game. She tweeted that South Carolina fans spit on Missouri players after the game. Missouri's athletics director Jim Sturt complained that Tigers players were called the in-word and spit on. He blamed Don Staley. Here's a quote. We had players spit on and called the in-word and things like that, Sturt said in 2018. I mean, it was not a good environment and unfortunately, I think Coach Staley promoted that kind of atmosphere and it's unfortunate that she felt she had to do that. Staley dismissed the allegations as serious and false to take a listen. The accusations are serious and false and they will be handled in the manner reflective of those facts and that's all I'm going to say about. You got a question. And so that was that. That was the end of it. No one refused to play South Carolina. Stephen A. Smith never discussed the alleged racism bubbling within Staley's program and fan base. No one that I'm aware of has called out Staley for this blatant hypocrisy. When her fan base was accused of being out of control, she claimed her fans are the greatest in the world saying quote, our fans are great. They're loyal. They're passionate. They understand basketball. They understand how to act in the stands. I stand by our fans. I stand by what they represent. I stand by how they cheer. I stand by every single thing they bring to the building because it's appropriate and well within the rules of the day you go girl. Yaaas queen. That's black elite privilege. Staley gives to defend her fan base. The BYU Athletics director Tom Homo apologized before anyone even had a chance to investigate the legitimacy of Rachel Richardson's claims. This is idolatry. Based on skin color, Staley and her fans are above sin and BYU is covered in sin. Provo Utah is a place too dangerous for black women's basketball players. Meanwhile, Memphis is heaven on earth. Don Staley is committed to cleaning up Utah and ignoring Memphis. 1% of Utah is black. 64% of Memphis is black. Don Staley cares about Don Staley. She uses race to benefit her bank account. That's my fire. And before I bring TJ Mo and Shamika into this conversation, I want to take care of a little business and then we'll have plenty of time to chat. We're in a recession and the only way to combat it is to think smarter about how we shop. You're buying meat at the grocery store but you could be buying it better.

All right, now for business out of way, we can go back to discussing Don Staley and the hypocrisy she has shown here with the way she's handled. BYU, what do you think of my argument? Shemeakin then will bring in TJ Mo. What do you think of my argument that if she's really concerned about her player safety, cancel the series with Memphis. Players in far more dangerous in danger and Memphis than Utah. Yeah, first I want to say Jason, because I miss you saying that, you know, at the top of the show, I miss your owls just so you know. Oh, I'm sorry. Yes. Yeah, it's been a while since I've done that. Right, and I love it. And also, yeah, I'm wondering if Don has even looked at her players lately, because we're talking about women that are really tall. They walk on the court all hunched back, you know, they're grabbing the crutches that they don't have. So of course, like, why are they scared to go to BYU? I'm sure they call each other in the locker room, because that's exactly what many of them think they are. So no, she's not afraid to go to Memphis and she should be, but she's not because she'll feel right at home and she thinks that her players will be right at home. TJ, having been a mazoo tiger, perhaps you know Jim Stirk, perhaps you know, I think the women's coach is Robin Pingenton. Pigeon, yeah. And perhaps you know them. They had some serious allegations in 2018 about South Carolina and what transpired there. And obviously that was all blown off. And I find it just fascinating that it's basically the same situation as BYU. Don said he gets to say, nope, that never happened as false. Everybody moves on, but there's these severe repercussions for BYU. Well, that's instructive of how you should handle these things. And perhaps there's some black privilege involved here because she's a black, she's in the oppression Olympics, right? Gay black woman. And so everything to her is oppression, but she's a black lady. So she gets to stand up and say that I stand behind everything that our fan base represents. I wish everybody could experience, but what we experience here at South Carolina, they're great. They bring the right atmosphere. And then everybody says, Oh, well, a black lady said it. And so we'll just let it go. BYU, everybody knows is virtually 100% white. And so they don't get that same luxury. But I'll tell you, they should have given the same response. How about saying, look, we're going to look into this, but there's not a shred of evidence that this happened. And the one person that you're saying it may have been was a special needs kit. So we're looking into this, but don't you dare defame us in the meantime and cancel our program. What you're trying to do is cancel BYU all together and tell us that we need to give you a whole bunch of money to bring in our sensitivity training and everything that comes in. That's the kind of stuff that drives me insane. BYU has gone directly into their apology tour instead of standing strong. And this is what happens, right? And so I do think that's somewhat instructive. To your point about Mizzou, I know Jim Stirk well, I know Robin pinched him quite well. Jim Stirk ended up having to settle a lawsuit for $50,000 over comments that he made, right? And her comments, she decided to bring the lawsuit. And here's what she said. She said, this was about my reputation that I've built over my career. I'm my mother's child. And so she's raised me properly. If anything synonymous with anything that's negative, if it's seen the light, it's a direct relation to what she's done in raising me and her other kids. And so I'm extremely happy. So she was not okay with being defamed in her eyes, but she's perfectly fine with defaming everybody at BYU and casting them as dangerous to what would be happening to her team. I mean, she's she's a walking contradiction. I did not know that Jim Stirk had to settle that lawsuit with her. But what I find fascinating about BYU's response to all of this is, is that, again, Don Staley gets to say, hey, my mother, my family, the way that I was raised, none of these things could be true about me, where BYU, their athletic director, can't say, hey, hold on. These are good kids here at our school. We've had we've been competing in athletics with diverse opponents for years, for years. No one has ever leveled these kind of accusations and no one certainly has taken these types of actions. Oh, we can't play at BYU because it's so racially hostile there. I don't understand why I do why. The athletic director hoped that by apologizing, it would just go away and everybody would move on quickly. But that's not how things work. Once you've been that knee, they say, well, hold on, stay down there while you're on your knees. There's some business I want you to handle while you're down there. And that's what Don Staley, that's why she's oh, we got someone bent over. And there's a gang bang going on. And so she's coming in to hop in on it. She's a low. I her privilege and only a black woman could get away with that at this time, for me, in my view. Oh, you're absolutely right. And TJ hit the nail on the head when he says she has two things in her favor. Not only is she a black woman, she's a black lesbian. And so of course, when it comes to the alphabet mafia, they can do whatever they want to because if you happen to say anything against them, all of their mafia fans are going to come after you. So she can say whatever she wants because she is a black woman, but also because she's a black lesbian. And that's what they're propping up in place now. The woman that's going to be against men, especially the black men, and this woman that's supposed to be the future because the future is feminine as though, you know, as they say, and you have people like Stacy Abrams and Nicole Hannah Jones that are just running with this whole I'm a black female. Hear me roar. Here's one thing. Go ahead, TJ. I was just going to add to I actually think it's three things. I think it's black female and gay. So each one of those things gives you a special privilege. She actually went out on the woman thing on her own as well. A few years back, she went right at Mark Emmer, the commissioner of the NCAA, over what she thought the amenities should have been for the women in the NCAA tournament and how the women are not treated like the men and it's a disgrace in this whole unity and work together thing is just a charade. I went and looked up for 2019. These are the last figures I could find. I went and looked up the net profits for the men's NCAA tournament March Madness versus the women's and this is the net revenues much higher than this, but the net profits for the men 864 million dollars in just March Madness alone for the women. They lost 2.8 million dollars and she thinks that's all irrelevant. So not only is she stupid, but she takes that stupidity into giving her the feminine the radical feminist position. She's now shown her black privilege and at some point down the road, she hasn't done this quite yet, but we will see her gay privilege come out. Listen, I don't I don't she's emotional, not well thought out, but I don't think she's stupid because she's getting paid quite a bit three four million dollars at South Carolina and she's used her privilege black gay female the whole nine to get that money. It's funny in researching for this topic when I went back and looked it to 2018 incident with Mizzou. I found a story where Frank Martin who was the South Carolina coach at that time, he was defending Don Staley very passionately and strongly against what Mizzou was saying and I happened to know Frank Martin Frank Martin's a high character guy and I've read this and it was interesting. I think it was on Monday just this past week. Don Staley did an interview with Jamelle Hill and she took a dump on Frank Martin and was telling some story complaining about how much more success she had than Frank Martin, but his raises were better than mine and she had to point that out to South Carolina. He went to one final four. I've won two national championships and went to four or at that time one national champion I think and went to four final fours or something at that time and how dare South Carolina pay him more than me. And again that sort of logic works in this environment where we have where no one can look at well hold on he's competing in a tournament with a history that's nearly 100 years old the competition is greater there's only about four or five women's team every year that have any chance of winning a national championship and it's really just one or two most years and so she's walking up and climbing up a far easier hill than Frank Martin or any man's coach at a power five but she's used all that logic and the fact that no one everyone's afraid to challenge her because if you challenge her either you're racist, sexist or homophobic and so her logic never gets challenged she's bullied South Carolina in the pain her far more than what she's actually worth and I know she's had some success but she's not worth that just based on the math and the money they're generating and I'm happy that there's some politicians in South Carolina that are asking like real questions because what is the standard though literally we're going to cancel games because at a volleyball match that you weren't at no one was at it's televised there's no proof at a volleyball match something happened and therefore I can't play at BYU and and based off of all the research I could see based off of what her comments were I think this past weekend she made this decision without consulting anybody wow she didn't consult the athletic director she didn't consult it she woke up and said this is what I want to do and the athletic director so afraid of her he's not going to challenge her because again if you challenge her you're racist sexist or homophobic so she's making three or four million dollars okay so I'm gonna go get me a pair of slacks a button-up shirt and some loafers and pull my hair back to the back and teach people how to do a better jump shot because my goodness yeah I'm in the wrong line of business the audacity though and and TJ Gary Pinkle had a lot of success at Mizzou we've seen a lot of male coaches have a lot of success and and they get power and but I'm to most of these coaches they're going to consult their athletic director before making a decision of this met we're canceling here someone has to fix that someone has to schedule and this was their home opener South Carolina they just won a national championship and again maybe it's not a hard problem to fix but someone has to fix it and you don't just get to take this kind of dump on BYU without consulting the other interested concerned accountable partners that you're allegedly working with but to me South Carolina women's college sports the meet that they've created Frankenstein and eventually Don Saby's going to turn on her balls and anybody else that she feels gets in her way of how much money she thinks she deserves like I said she hit the oppression trifecta and at this point she's invincible until somebody tells her otherwise that there's another piece of this that I think is you know we're talking about BYU we're talking about you know with the some of the stupidity and how people have allowed her to just run rampant and do whatever she wants but you know this is not a politically winning message but I think it should be you know it's what she's saying here and based on what you gave us with the you know comparing it to Memphis this is an extension of the idea that words hurt more than actions right to Chris to quote Chris Rock anybody who says that words hurt more than actions has never been punched in the face right and so she said and you quoted this in in your article uh I just wanted to make sure our players didn't have to endure that because if something happened of that manner I don't have the words to comfort them so what I'm going to do is I'm going to rescue them away from ever having anything uncomfortable said to them the true message the message that would prepare 20 year olds to go out into the world is how about the world is hard and people will not always treat you with the respect that you should be treated with okay your job is to overcome and to have mental toughness and to fight through you will be stronger for it's an opportunity to develop your character why other people are showing their lack of character right and so every environment that's difficult is an opportunity for you to grow if anything happens I've got your back here and I will do my part to make sure you're protected but you worry about you don't worry about somebody who happens to be in the crowd who's revealing their lack of character that's what should have been said and so what she's done is she's put this little protection bubble around these girls who never think they have to hear anything that makes them uncomfortable and again not a great word not something that people should hear and we should all do our part to stomp that out but your job is to say let me show you how to deal with that not how to make sure you never have to deal with that because I can't do that your whole life this is such the antithesis of the environment I grew up in as an athlete and again it's like these women they want all the same pay and opportunity as men but do they want to put up with what men have put up with and I'll cite this example and I'm gonna sound a little bit like Al Bundy remembering my glory high school days but but it's just true what we used to play a high school called Martinsville High School in Martinsville, Indiana and we played them my junior year the year before they went 11 to 1 had a pretty good team but Martinsville is known as the home of the KKK in Indiana a lot of people cited as one of the early foundational places where the KKK took hold. Martinsville as a kid and I would even say as an adult but certainly as a young person I no fond memories of Martinsville some fear of Martinsville my high school was a powerhouse school Jeff George was our quarterback you know we were but anyway my junior year we go to play at Martinsville our coaches told our parents stay home don't don't don't don't subject your parents to this environment at Martinsville but we're gonna go over there and we're gonna kick their butt and then we're gonna come home and again you know our team was probably 50% black 50% white or whatever black parents stayed home we went over and kicked Martinsville's butt 27 to 7 and their fans were rowdy their fans were idiots but we went over and kicked their butts and they had a pretty good team and then the next year they came to our place and we actually played them twice played them in the regular season and in the playoffs we beat them by like 30 points each time and they had a good play good players good team but it was a motivating thing for me right oh i'm kicking these races his butt and and it motivated me and what what's even funnier though is i ended up meeting Martinsville's best player he was a wide receiver named Brad Shields he was on the same all-star football team for me postseason one of the greatest people i ever met he we really hit it off he went on to play football at Indiana University i'm not sure if he played much of it but a great kid i'm not saying that's all of Martinsville because it certainly wasn't but it was just weird and i run it's like i i grew up at a time where we embrace all we're gonna go over and kick these white people that don't like but who we embrace that and these guys are running from it right that that it blows my mind uh samika i want i want to ask you this and then we'll we'll be done with it but do you think Don Staley actually believes that the actions she's taking are helping black people no i don't think she actually believes that i think she's seeking attention and i think that she is doing what a lot of women do even though she doesn't realize maybe that she is one is just seeking attention and that's why i don't like female leaders even looking listening to what you were just saying about how they told the parents to stay home women they do this we have this empathy and we want to nurture and we want to keep people safe and i don't think that makes the best leaders you know even i wasn't an athlete but just in the band my band director at the time we were these hot like gabberding uh major ed outfits we had to wear them if it was a hundred degrees outside we had to wear them if it was 30 degrees outside with our legs out and just you know he expected us to always be in uniform always to be ready no matter where we were it didn't matter that me and we're like hollering at us sometimes or you know but as you progress the band now if it's cold they have to have on wind suits and they have a female band director you know they have to eat before the the the performances and they are just baby kids now are baby and that's why i don't like female leadership because there is a place and a time for that nurturing but then there's a time in a place where me and and fathers tell you to kind of have a backbone and stand up and teach you how to deal with the real world and so i don't i don't think she thinks that she's being helpful i know i think she's looking for attention honestly but she has some female characteristics that are just natural to us that we want to protect people but i think she's seeking attention because this kind of had died down a little bit i haven't heard people speaking much about it and now she's bringing it up again i think it's for attention all right uh do you like a good

welcome back uh time to uh roll out to washing in dc and bring in our main man the Arnold squires smartest man on the show he's written another terrific column shameka i don't know if you've read this but we'll have Delano describe it he's written a column about uh female empowerment and how it's basically second wave feminism has driven young girls nuts he that he asserts they become more violent they become more sexually promiscuous and it's one of the reasons why this whole notion that uh women are that women have been oppressed and men live a life of privilege that's why you see so many women say you know what i want to be a man i want that privilege of being a man and so anyway i'll let Delano describe the conversation but you being the mother of three and being a woman yourself i can't wait to hear your reaction Delano uh i did a decent job of describing what you wrote but you can do a better one please do i don't know that was pretty good Jason um so yeah you you're you're spot on my my entire thesis is that um there's a lot going on with our girls teenage girls young women are exhibiting behaviors that are signs of deep deep trouble and and dissatisfaction in their personal lives so i i start the column talking about to me what seems like an increase in young girls 13-year-olds 15-year-olds 16-year-olds engaging in serious acts of violence i talk about two teenage girls in d.c who attempt to carjack uh an uber-e-e-driver end up killing him um the 14-year-old charge for murder uh in the death of i think i believe his name is James Lambert in philadelphia her and some of her friends beat him to death with traffic cones at 2 30 in the morning and i'm a 13 and 15-year-old girl um who arrested last week along with some male counterparts in the beating death of a taxi cab driver in New York City and and over and over again i keep seeing these videos you know a lot on viral videos where girls are basically acting like boys but much worse like their their fights are just as intense and sometimes even more violent um and that's just a sign of trouble and then i talked about i brought up britney renter and um image she posted on twitter where she it was it was um like something over her door and it said it's not a whore house it's a whore home um and she was smiling i mean she's known for being controversial but i i said on twitter like no one no woman actually wants to live this way you know what i mean so you she may have bought into this notion that being sexually promiscuous is empowering but when you get people like that in the honest moments she'll end up telling on herself so i i talk a little bit about that as well so my entire position is that our girls are in trouble um between the violence the promiscuity and as you said the girls were just giving up on being girls all together right who who think because they like basketball and want to wear a low haircut that it's time to to cut off their breasts and get a uh a hysterectomy um all of those things are signs of trouble but this is not a complete gloom and doom column i end by talking about the the positive influence that i believe many christian women particularly ones who are online can have and are having in this conversation who who paint a a better picture of femininity and provide an alternate path from what you know the feminist icons from the 60s have have laid out to girls so these are women the ones that i'm talking about um are ones who believe that femininity as god created it is a good thing and that family is a good thing and that marriage is a good thing um as opposed to what the culture says which is women your your divine worship yourself you know pursue career at all costs even if it means forsaken family kill your own offspring and be and act as bad as you want to act act just as bad as the boys um so so i think there's cause for concern and but ultimately my point is you know there are some rays of hope there what a lot of what you wrote about obviously very fast dating to me i i just spent some time out of town and was just blown away and it made me think about the cultural rot and the ramifications particularly as it relates to black people and the destruction of family structure and and again it's it's an issue that's running through all of america but it's most acute in us and and we act like there are no ramifications for it there are no consequences for our entire family structure bling obliterated and and i'm like the ramifications the consequences are so obvious there's staring us in the face virtually every day young people have virtually no respect for the older generation and i'm not even sure if we're in position to demand the respect because we didn't raise them properly and so you actually get what you invest in it's no different than a 401k if we haven't invested in kids why should we expect them to respect us in the return that kind of loyalty that that you see passed on generation to generation there should be you know i was raised in a fashion that makes me be like well i'm gonna take care of my mother and father as they get older and blah blah blah and and i i just don't see and then when i look at i feel like and this could be my bias but that the the sexual dysfunction the uh it just seemed gay is the new black and and i don't know if we should be surprised by that given the fact that we we seem quite comfortable with our family structure being in total disarray yeah and i think we're pushing it when you say that it's right here before our eyes we can see how the children have changed now not only do they not respect authority they don't respect themselves something that we used to do uh when we were growing up we cared about how people looked at us we cared about whether or not we were going to get in trouble with our mom i can remember doing things and not even thinking about the law i would say my mom was going to kill me because we respected them and we walked a certain way because we also respected ourselves and it bothers me that in the black community we're not seeing exactly what has happened and we're not seeing that women being in competition with men instead of trying to complete men has caused our children not to have anybody at home focus on their upbringing and their nurturing and for you know trying to produce productive citizens out here and when we see the young girls there was a young lady i just got a video last week where she was in the classroom and one of the assistant principals came in to address her because she was acting up in the class he was a male but she tried to stand toe to toe with him and was cursing him out and was telling him that she would beat his ASS and she really believed that she could and i think part of that is because women are lying there naturally we are nurturers but women have decided i want to be the man so there's this war going on inside of them if they were so happy they wouldn't be so angry and i'm talking about from the top to the bottom these elite women who are so bitter and who are so angry and who just hate me and so much i think it's because there's this war going on within them and they're lying having to portray that they want to be these powerful CEOs because they don't want to be oppressed and they don't want to be less than because they're women when naturally you are nurturers naturally you are put here for men and so if you're going to have this going on within you you're going to be angry you're going to be mad and we're seeing our young daughters be more angry than we ever were because we've continuously pushed on them that they have to be more masculine they have to be more powerful and they want to be these false bitches and being charged and we're constantly pushing a message on them that wars with their very nature and who women were created to be. Delano i'm going to let you jump back in here is that what you see i know you're raising a daughter you and your wife at least one daughter i believe is that what you see? Shamiga hit the nail right on the head honestly i think one i have never met a self-described feminist or a woman who talks about smashing a patriarchy who i would characterize as at peace or content with her life right always bitter always angry now she a lot of these men will say well i don't i don't need a man i don't want a man i'm you know i got my friends i got the brunch i do whatever but to Shamiga's point one of the most frustrating things you can do in your life is to fight against nature because the fight against nature is a fight against god and he's undefeated so it will be as if i keep i spend my entire life every day of my life throwing objects up in the air and then hoping that they stick and then when they come down and they smack me in the head i get upset about it well just because i'm trying to fight against gravity and in the same way these these women who think that they don't need men and i said towards the end of the piece i said you know this country our culture we've been discipled by ideologues who believe seriously that a woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle and then we turn around and wonder why so many kids are growing up without fathers right but everything that they do tries to recreate what it is that they say that they reject right so that that part of them that is nurturing and oftentimes desires to be mothers and wants to have children um when when that doesn't happen and sometimes because of decisions that they make okay i'll be a mom to a few puppies or a cat or some other type of pet right um when they say well i don't really want a man i don't need a man so on and so forth they'll either get with a woman who tries to you know use some sort of prosthetic device to mimic the the male experience or they'll just get something from the store put a few batteries in it and say well it's good enough right so at the end of the day um men need women and women need men because we were created from one another and one of the things yes is true and I said in the piece that children need their fathers obviously but one of the reasons I talk so much about marriage in this context is because sometimes um we pull the family disembodied the family and make it seem as if the father's the only good for children but there's something I have to believe that there's something unique that I bring to my wife's life and that she brings to mine wherein we need one another right that that's companionship that's love that's all different types of personal fulfillment but my relationship my role in my home is not just towards my children and I think you know to Shamika's point a lot of that is missing and I think a lot of these women are angry and and these are the women who either because they have children themselves or because of the in the outside influence they have in the culture they have been nursing the younger generations for a long time and one thing I learned about kids is Shamika Kupaya tested this you can you can smell the mother's breast milk on the baby's breath right so when it's rancid you know exactly where the child got it from and and the type of things that we see in our culture there's the milks going bad I'll just leave it like that I wonder if I'm just an old, fuddy-duddy I'm turned into my parents but you know I was at a hotel this weekend and young dude came through the hotel no shirt on jeans were the belt on but below his butt cheeks and he could barely walk he was walking funny to keep the pants up and and and I just looked and I was just I was so bothered upset and was just like now he's somebody's son somebody you know and it do look like he was 25 to 30 years old or whatever and I just couldn't imagine myself presenting myself that way in public but I also was like maybe I'm just old and maybe everybody else looks and sees that and thinks nothing and just says but that's just the fashion of the day and it's it's no different than I don't know fashion statements that I made that my father you know my father always wanted me to wear a suit and tie and early in my life in my career I didn't and so maybe it's maybe it's all the same but I just couldn't imagine dude he could barely walk and he's in a hotel no shirt on and he nice looking woman with him I gotta give him that but I was just am I just old no I don't think you're just oh I think you were raised with morals and values because my children are young but my daughters don't like when they see young men with their pants sagging and hanging my middle daughter is very conscious about what she's wearing that is not too revealing or it's not too sexy that has nothing to do with age I think that has everything to do with the values and steel that we are not instilling across the board now we want so much to be friends with our children instead of rearing them properly that we're letting them just run them up knowing that kids can't make the right decision all the time I knew a young man who in the eighth grade said he wanted to be spider-man when he grew up now if we would have just ran with that we would have said hey throw yourself out of windows see if you can go down but you have to it's up to us as adults to rear these children the right way train a child in the way that they should go and parents are not training children anymore they're trying to be friends Delano I'm gonna ask you this and let you go and set up our our next conversation with Tennessee Harmony I know you have I've asked you or you haven't seen honk for Jesus and and I'm gonna ask you this because I'm not sure if I'll get into it in the discussion with them but one of the things the movie honk for Jesus will discuss in Tennessee Harmony coming up in a bit with Pastor Anthony Shamika and Virgil Walker is is because again I don't know if this will come up but I think you'll have a great take on one the thing the movie doesn't get at because the minister and the first lady they don't have kids and and one of the things I thought about and maybe we've talked talked about on this show is like the black church isn't even focused on the development of family there there's not a lot of pressure within hey you better get married and you know this you know God's design for you is to be in a marriage man and woman raising child and it seems like that sort of ministry because we're certainly not getting those types of results from the black church they're not marrying their congregants so I'm gonna say well there's no men inside the church they're all in jail or they're all hanging out on the street corner or whatever but one thing about men even in this generation even though many of them are turning gay but men like to be in environments with women who they can procreate with and so it seems like the church would be a great place to be promoting family but it's not and and I wonder why it's not so I'll say a couple things here because um Jason as I think I told you I was recently at a conference out in Ohio right in close to Cincinnati and um it was a Christian conference and I mean I say on average the people there the families there had about six kids I've met a couple couples and to vast majority white so this is not you know the black church per se but it was just a stark difference part of it is I think because it was you know it wasn't you know right in the city so it was some you know suburban so to speak between Cincinnati and Kentucky um but I mean I met families that had 10 kids 11 kids and that they seem content and I was telling some of the guys that at my age the only two things that make me envious of any dude is if they have a better beard than I do or if they have more children than I do because I said with my three little kids it's like a wedding night starter pack up up that side but um as it relates to to the black church um I don't want to paint with a broad brush brush because when we say the black church um I'll say there's two main things two main churches go moving in parallel directions that people think about one is the more social justice oriented church that's majority black right they come from the historical lineage of king and then you have the more prosperity prosperity oriented black church so think of you know the t.d. jakes and so on and actually i'll add a third I would say these are more theologically conservative black churches um so this would be someone like you know Vodie Bakam or I'm out of Shamika's home state I think his name is Bishop Wooten or Wooten um he's he's over a cogent church and and he is again he's going to talk about male and female and God's created order and marriage and so forth but when it comes to some of those prosperity churches because I've been to some of them they do talk about marriage they promote it they have singles ministries to try to bring people together because they see marriage as something that that God values and they see children as a blessing now I'm not saying in those churches you're gonna see a black family walking with 12 kids because a lot of those churches at least the ones I've been to which are right outside of metropolitan areas it's still a typical two to three children you know because of all the advances in technology and so on so forth you know you leave that 10 kids stuff to the rural people but in the more social justice oriented churches the ones that take their marching orders from the left um you may get pro marriage messages but they will only circulate within the church whenever these pastors speak to the public in terms of their public profiles some of the names we've talked about here the William Barbers the Jamal Bryant's the Howard John Wesley's some of these bigger names they are going to talk about marriage equality quote-unquote so same-sex marriage um abortion um and now probably getting more into the gender ideology stuff because to them talking about marriage publicly makes it seem as if there's something wrong with the black community because we're not doing xy and z and for them they have to keep all of their focus on what they see as white supremacy so it's always about what white people are doing either to tear down our democracy quote-unquote or to advance systemic racism and white supremacy in one way or the other and that's that's the main reason you don't see any sort of mainstream black liberal leaders who talk about marriage and family as essential for the black community to thrive the last one who did it was President Obama and the only people who criticized him were people on his left and nobody else has taken up that mantle since then because and this goes to something that Tamika was saying um in our community when you talk about personal responsibility when you talk about things that we should do when you talk about upholding your family name and not behaving in certain ways in public they call that respectability politics because to them they think that they think that black people like us want our kids to behave a certain way so that they can be accepted by white people right that's that's not why that's not why I train my kids the way that I do I want them to be reflective of the god that their parents serve I want them to be image bearers in that way and I want them to do things that will benefit them I don't tell my kids not to steal so that they can be seen as acceptable to white folk because no white folk live in my neighborhood right I'm not raising my kids for somebody else but this is how that that group of black folk tend to think and it's in the church and it's within sort of the the mainstream democratic left so you're right they don't talk about marriage um they don't talk about children as a blessing in fact they talk about children as a burden who need to be eliminated um because they see abortion as sacrosanct and they see the ability to the right quote unquote to kill your child as one of the keys to black liberation so are you taking a bunch of notes you need a job in here well I was gonna say Bishop Wooten he is gonna preach the bible he is the one one of the ones that endorsed uh lieutenant governor Mark Robinson so I really do like him and Jamal Bryant uh Delano brought him up he can't preach family and marriage because he was too busy cheating on his wife and um one of the things that also does bother me yes when they think that we're actually teaching our children this because we want them to be accepted I can't stand that with black people like I run into that a lot online they'll say oh you're saying that in front of like on this show because you know you have white people in the audience and you want to make them happy no I'm saying that because I actually have eyes and I can see what's happening in the community in the culture and I want us to change it I don't care who's in the audience I have a love and a heart for people and if I see people going astray I'm going to speak out about it I hate the idea that we can't say certain things because people think we're trying to get brownie points with white people and that we can't raise our children a certain way because we're just trying to get them to be liked by white people no I'm raising my children the way that I think that they should live their lives and that's so crazy you know and Delano brought that up it happens so much and it gets on my last nerve guys I gotta run uh who was among the first people to challenge the narrative in the BYU Duke volleyball case it wasn't the

throughout the rest of the week Anthony's quite the sports fan and and fits the brand of this show in virtually every way and so I just wanted to make that little bit of of an announcement and so Anthony if you would bless this conversation then we'll get into it father god we're thankful for the opportunity to share on this platform we're thankful for the opportunity to communicate your truth to the masses father bless us in our discussion and bless the things that we share and we pray that everything that we say and do is pleasing in your sight it's in Jesus name we pray amen amen all right so gas and virtual walkers here where this is well via Skype I forgot about that but I saw a movie or Shamika saw it first and then said hey if you and I it was on my list honk for Jesus to see you reminded me to go see it I went and saw it two days ago at the theater and I want to talk about this there's a lot to unpack honk for Jesus is a satirical look at a mega black church is I think that's a fair description of it and I went into it with a lot of baggage expecting to hate it and so I hate watched it while I was there I had a scowl on my face the entire time like man they were they killing the black church they killing us I was uncomfortable and I went when I left I was like this was terrible it's a D minus F movie this is terrible and then the more I sat with it and thought about it and how emotional I was watching the movie I was like no this was an effective movie and maybe it was holding a mirror up to us and maybe this was a fair movie than what I'm giving an credit for so guys I just want to I want to start there and we'll go ladies first start with just a very simple question honk for Jesus is and it depicts a Eddie Long type character and his wife in a relationship between the lead minister and his wife and they've lost their mega church because of impropriety sexual impropriety is implied and that's where the Eddie Long aspect of it they're basically saying this black minister was gay and you know lost his mega church and now he's trying to rebuild it and they're basically out on the street holding up signs honk for Jesus so let's start with just a simple question and we'll go to Shameka first Anthony and then we'll bring Virgil in was this a good enjoyable movie my initial reaction was this was trash that was what I said at first when it went off I looked at my daughter who was there because my mom had called and said hey I got you and your daughter tickets to go see this movie my grandmother was there my god mom was there so we went as a family and I was really tired like I hung out the night before so I didn't want to go but since my mom had got tickets I was like I'm gonna go I looked at my daughter went and went off and I was like this was trash and I think because it wasn't like a wake-up call for me it was things that I had already observed about the church and so it was almost just sitting there watching like okay yeah this is what the black church is like in my opinion so it wasn't a wake-up call whereas I think a lot of people went in there and it was like wow either they were mad because they feel like that's not what the church is like or there were people that said this is gonna hold a mirror to people in the church for them to see that this is what it's like and for me I came to that conclusion years ago so I was sitting watching something that I had seen in church 10 years ago so you still stand by a trash yeah it wasn't really enjoyable probably because of the rated R aspect of it like I think they took that but honestly you know as we talked a lot of that is in the culture today the only thing that gave it any kind of saving grace from my aspect is some of the stuff is the truth they pushed the limit a little bit but some of that was true and one of the things that was true that may not be as obvious in the movie was just the pressure of ministry that you know that couple dealt with the pressure that they dealt with some of that does hit real now how they dealt with it obviously I could care less but yeah it's about about a C minus for me uh Virgil your take well uh first of all and you you'd call me and ask me to to watch it I'm glad I didn't go to the to the theater to watch it because I probably would have left very upset it was absolute trash but at the same time for me it was a it was a lived experience it was something that that I you know I had lived out not in the way that I used to attend higher dimensions evangelistic center where Carlton Pearson was the pastor there's a movie that's done about him called come Sunday and you can watch that on Netflix watching that whole experience unfold in real time all it did was remind me of you know of the experience that was depicted in the movie this is just kind of the stereotypical kind of black church prosperity gospel kind of preaching pastoral issues that that you see time and time again in the black church and it's unfortunate that it is there was a there was a point at which man I literally I had to be honest I had to turn it off because it was just it was it was too uh just unbelievable I mean I shouldn't say let me let me let me rephrase that it was it was so it was so realistic that it was unbelievable to me that someone depicted it on a screen in the way that they had that's probably a better way to say what I'm trying to say but yeah there came a point at which I just I just got sick to my stomach uh and just shut it off knowing where things were going to go and what was going to happen but again I think I think to the point Jason for you even challenging us to take a look at the movie I think there's a broader conversation that needs to be had around the the the anemic aspect of the black church in a culture that's so vulnerable and need and needs the church what's what's taking place what's transpired I think that's a that's a welcome to conversation to have I of course didn't need to spend any money or time watching the movie to come to that conclusion it all sounds like we're saying the same thing that because and that's where I'm telling you I started out trash left there angry but I'm now coming to the conclusion that maybe that's exactly what they wanted me to feel and maybe they wanted to call us out and put a mirror to our face and for me when I left there one of the things and and I've made a great deal of progress as it relates to my language and cussing yeah I've made a great deal of progress I'm I don't say this with any bragging just transparency the word MF was probably my favorite word in the dictionary I used it all the time I grew up and I got just keeping real I grew up at my father's bar the masterpiece lounge and before that Jimmy's J bar J and that's how people greeted each other and that's how it was a term of affinity and affection and and I used MF that way that's my MF blah blah blah and I mean I have a very foul tongue and I've Tony Dungy three four years ago called me out on my language like hey man you you you saying you a Christian brother of mine and you talking this way hey Jason do better and and I immediately said you know I got to do better if Tony Dungy's calling me out in it and and that's what this movie hammered home to me because it was so profane not just uh it was the minister his wife and everybody that was because they had it fictionalized that everybody in the city was talking about the fall of this minister they'd call into radio talk shows and everybody's dropping inward and other cuss words and all this profanity and I was like oh my god is this how we sound because I was looking and I was like I don't want to sound anything like that ever again and that's when I started having that conclusion that's when I started going this is an effective piece of satire and art if it's provoking a grown person like me to convict myself and and spark this kind of emotion that maybe you know I think most stuff coming out of Hollywood is done to destroy us I felt like this movie is actually done to shake us up and maybe make us want to do better that that is the feeling I come away but it particularly from Virgil and and Shamika I'm hearing y'all live this experience and therefore don't want to relive it in a movie but I had I grew up in a very small small church and my experiences have been with small churches not mega churches and so I don't I don't know this experience I don't and and of that kind of pressure but anyway I'm kind of rambling I want Shamika or any of you guys to jump back in here I the profanity and just like it's hard to be taken it was hard for me to take any of them seriously when that young mother was holding her two-year-old baby and her and the first lady of the church were cussing at each other back and forth I was sick to my stomach yeah I wouldn't say that I've seen a lot of profanity but the nastiness like the passive aggressiveness I've seen that and with women in the church for a very long time so the scene in the mall where the woman couldn't really you know come out and say what she wanted to say was like nice nasty type yeah that happens all the time and so that I was completely familiar with and so I did notice the profanity but I'm not very familiar with pastors just cursing like it's nothing I will say that but the nice nasty especially under a female pastor that I was for a little while oh it was nothing for you to have what was should have been a private meeting and then it's preached over the poor pit and it's so descriptive that it would be very easy for the people in the congregation to know exactly who it is and your business just be out there and you know the digs that come across the poor pit I've experienced that and I'm so used to it so when I saw them kind of being caddie with each other it was like oh okay yeah this is what happens in church would you think about the rap scene in the car not till we bulk or the that that was hilarious to me it was funny but I feel like I'm so far removed from the church that nothing just surprises me anymore but yeah that it was so that I found that funny because it just seemed so extreme like I said I haven't seen my pastor's curse and act out in that way so that seemed really extreme to me and I was able to laugh at that part but I'm pretty sure it happens you know literally this is a great question for anything because they seem to be depicting about a minister it was about 40 I would think yeah about your age and so what did you think of it they got a scene where the minister and the first lady are in their car driving up to their competitors church and they're doing the whole rap song is it what's it called knuck to your buck knuck if you buck or whatever and they knew every lyric and it's very profane what did you think of that I'll say this when you're saved you know yes you've transformed your life you change what you do etc but you still know you know that stuff you still know those songs so but the idea that that scene brought up to me though there's three words that I looked at three themes that I looked at in this movie that I saw the element of truth competition the cosmetic nature of it and the cover up so the whole idea of competition you know competition exists not just in the black church but in black culture to some degree and you may even call it comparison you know we're always kind of looking at one another one of the first three questions a man will ask another man is what do you do I'm measuring you up I'm we're competing so the fact that this as they're going over there they're just trying to hype themselves up that's a locker room scene basically trying okay yeah they think there's something let's go over here and see what's going on so I saw the competition but you notice it through the whole movie so there's a whole dynamic of them looking at the other church and even the younger couple that's supposed to be the young up and couple you know up and coming couple even they have a little bit of that in them like you know as they're saying when we get to your level I hear that amongst ministers sometime they're thinking that there's this kind of and I keep trying to remind myself like the real score board is saving souls like I'm not trying to compete with how many members y'all got and whatever I hope it's because if you win in good god is winning you know but but that whole competition piece is what I saw in that so Virgil I'll throw it to you and then Anthony you jump in as well uh as an athlete part of me said you know competition just makes you better and the competition within churches tell me why why it's bad I'm not saying I I think that but I'm just saying as an athlete that's the competition makes everybody better as a business person competition makes everybody better why doesn't competition work in a church environment yeah I think a great question that yes I think the main reason is because it ain't your church right this the church is not your church it's not it doesn't have your name on it it didn't it wasn't blood bought by you the church was blood bought by christ so it's not your church it does not belong to you you you are simply a servant an undersheperd of the lord jesus christ if you understand that and you read the book which tells you that that you that your team wins you don't have to worry about competition I'm not trying to gain or obtain anybody over you I recognize that god is sovereignly in control of everything in this world and those church members who are going to be at my church are going to be there based upon the way that god has organized and orchestrated the world in which we live so there's not the idea of competition with regard to that I the other thing I would say to regarding what you mentioned earlier and I'll turn it back over to anthony and that is just simply I think you give these the ladies who did the movie a way too much credit in that you're the thought being that they wanted us to view something and reflect I think these were women who were hurt by by the church and this was this was their cathartic kind of their counseling experience they put it all on a on a screen and they walked away from it after it when I had a chance to go back and because again I knew that after I think it was the nuk thing where they were driving home the first time and all the cuss and I'm like okay I'm gonna have to shut this off and in an effort to to be having integrity with regard to having coming on and talking about it I need to do some other study who are these women who put this movie together why were they putting the movie together I watched quite a bit of footage of them talking about this was their church experience and just like them that was my church experience I think the difference between us both was the road that they went down ended up pointing you in a in a direction to to to throw stones at the church or to expose the church let's just say it that way to expose the church but never really pointing anyone to the solution and that's what I found problematic again it was a it was a the movie is a as a comedy it's perhaps not designed to point you in the right direction but I know I know quite a few comedians who will show you what's what's chaotic or crazy but then also at the same time point you to what's right good and true and so they had no obligation to do anything they did what they did based upon where they stood their worldview at the end of the day I'm examining that worldview I'm examining where they are and I'm simply saying they they're they're definitely have they've definitely been hurt by the church but I'm not sure that the healing has taken place other than the fact that they've walked away from anything related to organized religion they have spirituality that they claim all kinds of things but nothing in the way of of a of a Christian kind of church experience based upon what I researched and found so and I'll toss this to you aunt I love that answer but I I somewhat disagree just as a journalist and as a provocateur uh sometime I'm gonna defend these ladies and and say and again I haven't done all that deep dive of of what their motives were I'm just judging them based off this movie is is one of the issues we have I think in America with everybody but I do think it's acute with us is like we're in denial about problems and if somebody doesn't say no no here's the problem and here's what it looks like we never get to a solution because we just go well well that's just Eddie Long that's the Carlton guy that you referenced but the whole of the church the problem and to me I think what I'm hearing from Shamika from even you Virgil a little bit and and my own understanding is that maybe the problems aren't as bad as what's depicted in this movie but there are some major problems within the whole black church particularly you mentioned the cosmetic aspect of of you know everybody dressing up in it's a fashion show and there's a whole competition around that what was it competition cosmetics and then there was another C word cover up the cup yeah and then if there is a problem there's no transparency yeah and and so we never get to a solution we just keep competing keep dressing up and keep covering up and and to me my takeaway Virgil I can only talk about how the movie hit me it makes me want to do better it it it it whatever I don't know what their agenda and goal is but I would like to meet them and and say hey I'm sorry this happened and it sparked at least amongst us for a conversation where we can get to hey what are the solutions how real are these problems that they're talking about and how do we address them see that's that what he just mentioned though that was the minus part of my C in that it just told the negative experience there wasn't a salvation at the end there wasn't a resolution at the end it even leaves you on that cliff finger you don't mean you kind of know what may happen but you really don't know how it resolves I was looking at it like okay does the younger couple now do they go on with the same attitude that they took now they're top dogs oh they were definitely headed that direction you see how you know but they started out humbly and now they're going that way there wasn't that resolution so not even knowing who the directors were producers or what not I got the okay so now how does this what was the solution but as it relates even to you know this whole cosmetic nature we'd like for it just to look good and and and if it looks good we think it is good and so as they kept going through the movie there's more clothes there's more this there's more hats their problems were getting worse but she's out shopping let me okay let me just make this up and so what happens as it relates to reality not film but reality is if we never do any real resolution to our problem if we never get down to say hey wait a minute no this is an issue here we got to take care of this we just can't you know put makeup on or get another hat or get a new building or build something else we never get to it then we just pass that problem on to the next generation personally I think we're putting the responsibility of the solution on the wrong person the solution is for the pastors that stand up every Sunday morning and have these people up under them to live Jesus the scripture says you know if I be lifted up I'll draw all men into me and so that is what I think the issue should be lifting Jesus that was one of the parts of the movie that really irritated me when he constantly said I'm trying to save souls I'm trying to save souls well it's not for you to save the soul Jesus says not man and so I think what we have to get back to is you know for these pastors in the church to remember to lift Jesus it's not about you it's not about the clothes you have or the material possessions that you own lift Jesus because he's supposed to do the drawing and I think churches have gotten so into trying to draw people with other things which is why we were talking about the mind thing and I said you know that's in the church it's in the church deeply and a lot and it's widespread you have the the mind the dance you have everything that kind of looks worldly so that you can draw people and so it's like what about the Jesus aspect is it's missing in a lot of churches the mind thing that's lit up I had never I was unaware and so when I called Shamika was talking about the movie I was like boy that mind thing they were trying to say that he put a full clown suit on his wife she's trying to be loyal to him and Shamika was like no you know they do that mind and I was like what what I haven't seen it yeah is it how common place is it very name like it's it's it's we don't have a church but there are there are churches that do all kinds of things like she was talking about all kinds of dance and mind and it's it's a variation of interpretive dance so they're going to be playing like like they did on the movie they're going to be playing a song and dancing to it and it's going to get you in this kind of mood of oh wow and you're paying attention to the song and seeing them dance and oh wow but all of those things take away from the actual truth yeah I'm not opposed to you know events ministries programs but at the end of the day this has to point to Jesus Shamika makes a great point we're lifting up Jesus one of the things we do at our church you know we have a big citywide backpack giveaway but what I want people everybody to leave with you know I'll be there with our ministry team and we're giving away thousands of backpacks and when I'm talking to the people pulling up getting the back and oh wow thank you all for this and this this is on Jesus like this is on God and and as they come I'm reminding them this is on God this is not because we're just so wealthy and all the no no no no no God has put us in a place to do this and you need to get to know him it always needs to point back to God yeah but back to the cover up if we're not really getting to the problem that was in you want to go back to that car scene the car scene shows that in a time where they should be focusing on prayer and getting a right relationship they're feeding themselves filth and it comes out in his language through the movie like it's just a filthy he's not really feeding himself in God's word so that's that truth that they don't get to they just cover it up oh we'll just do something else we'll cover up and in so many instances you know we would rather cling to a pretty lie than to embrace the ugly truth well I would my takeaway on him and Verdrama throw this back in your plate is like the mistake and I forget the the minister's name or the the fake minister's name in the movie but to me it was like I'm trying to save people I'm like brother you need to be saved yeah why aren't you somewhere yeah because again they thought it was a joke uh remember when they went in me with the younger preacher they thought they were there to get some marriage counseling you don't we don't need no counseling we don't have like when you still in love with dudes and you don't need no counseling you're gonna lead a church why you this you know so that was my my takeaway as a related to that but Verdrama I want to circle back to you in terms of the your critique of the producers and the ladies that and this is where I thought Shamika was gonna go but I'm gonna go there I'm not looking for these female producers of this movie to fix anything I'm looking for some men to fix what's wrong with the church it's not on these women to me did their job they look at the mess y'all created and and and so now I'm looking at me and everybody else like what are we gonna do about it I'm not expecting these ladies or Shamika to fix it no I don't disagree with with with that I and I would argue a couple things I as you guys were talking there were so many times I wanted to jump back in and I want to be be careful of of over talk but I will tell you this um you had mentioned earlier that you know that what they did was helpful because it caused you to to maybe take a look and reflect at where we are and what we're doing and I think that's that's a good thing at the end of the day I think those of us who know and love God are always examining our lives against the backdrop of what we see right the very nature of the gospel is transformative our hearts should change and as a result we have a different lens by which to view the world whenever we see something wrong we're examining that to say and am I the problem we start with ourselves that's a very nature of gospel transformation I'm going to start with me before I point at you or someone down the road I need to look at me and and I think Jason what you demonstrated even in watching the movie with that was your heart you came away from trash and said how can I look at this trash and examine my own life to make sure it doesn't look like what I just saw on the on the movie screen unfortunately everybody that was depicted in that movie did not do any of that none of them were doing any self-reflection not a one of them were doing any self-examination and so that's what should have been apparent that you mentioned the fact that that what the ladies did was helpful because we often don't know the problems don't don't address the problems and I'm going to push back and say we absolutely do know what the problem is everybody who was at Eddie Long's church folks knew what the problem was they wanted to suppress what they knew because they were liking the lifestyle the glam the cover up you know of the all the things that were talked about earlier they liked that so they wanted to keep that facade going but all of them knew that that it was a problem and more importantly those of us from the outside looking in absolutely knew there was a problem I'll say this as well oftentimes more times than not your show is is doing that very thing you are constantly examining two two groups of people you always talk about one is pastors and the others are comedians you say those are the truth tellers in the world so you're always acknowledging the fact that that that we need to look at life whether it's through the lens of humor or through the lens of truth and examine ourselves that it should be a reflection that that we that we take a look at and change our hearts about but but again you're right to the question you asked or the question you you posed those ladies owe us nothing and and I'm not looking for them to fix anything but I didn't need their help in trying to identify the problem nor do I need their help in identifying the truth the fact is that the truth is the gospel of Jesus Christ pastor Anthony he mentioned it we talk about it often on this program it's a very reason you have this this segment on your show you're pointing people with all the issues of culture you're pointing them back to the truth and that is the word of God and the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ so one thing I think we're beating around is is in terms of of why didn't they offer a solution why didn't they put any hope and if they're really even spiritual or still believing God their art should offer a little hope I will say this that Hollywood in order to get a movie made a TV show made or whatever it requires a nihilistic view of the world at this point yep but that we've removed hope from anything we offer in art and that's why if you listen to music again just even this is particularly acute this is across the board in American culture but it's particularly acute in the art that is perceived as black and it's why we don't make love songs anymore again this is just a fact so that's not an opinion they can show you in billboard taught right in the 1970s and 80s what dominated the billboard top 100 for soul music or whatever love songs love songs love songs everywhere now no love songs we don't we don't offer hope we don't offer love and so just for some people I just and again I get accused a lot of times of dumbing things down for the audience but I like to make things very clear so that even a baby can understand even so that I can understand and so it's like I went and made sure now I listed make sure I even have the right definition or whatever so I like to go to the dictionary and I just want to share with the audience so you can fully up the rejection of all religious and moral principles in the belief that life is meaningless extreme skepticism maintaining that nothing in the world has a real existence that's where we're at right now as it relates to American culture in every tv show in every movie there is no good and bad guys everybody's bad and that's what you saw in this hunk for Jesus everybody's bad I'm we talk on this show on Mondays about house of the dragon the new game of thrones spin off on HBO everybody's bad you go tv shows that I love and call the greatest the sopranos everybody's bad art is even the wire had a few good people or whatever but it's a very nihilistic view of America and so we don't have heroes anymore in movies and in art they want everybody taking a very skeptical extreme view of themselves and of the world and and so again I guess I offered that up as a defense of these they couldn't get the movie made if there had been a hero in this movie if there had been a representation of Jesus Christ and particularly a black representation of Jesus Christ in this movie it never gets made it just they just won't they won't allow it so they you can't and that's the young minister and his wife what they represented was the next generation of like you think something better is coming no what's coming at least at least the first iteration of the the first lady in his that man was the leader that next generation the young couple that woman was the leader she did all the talker and control it's a very I don't even know if I call it egalitarian she she was in control yes and and that's what they were trying to message message you and and again it's may particularly men are horrible and bad and if there's any hope for people for humanity and particularly black people it's in the womb right and the men are weak they're sexually perverse they have no discipline and they have no substance that's what basically they were saying about both of those medicines all the substance was coming from the women and so it was just a very nihilistic view but that is what the times require right now there are no heroes yeah and I think just in my lifetime I've seen the the wives of the pastors change like when I was a little girl it was the pastor's wife and then it went to first lady and you had to refer to her as first lady now it's co-pastor oh wow and now it's the wife has just as much say as the husband and the past the man is just not the pastor leading the church his wife is also the pastor and their co-pastors and they're both leading the church and so just in my lifetime I've watched it change from women kind of being you know in the back and letting the man lead to now women being in the front and saying no I got this that's a reflection of culture yeah yeah I would I would add another inward to it so you got nihilistic but the world and culture is growing more narcissistic it's about me and what I'm going to get out of this and so I see that in the movie but just to be you know as we try to do here you know be fearless and just be very honest about things what the enemy is ultimately trying to do with people of faith is to get them to doubt if he can get you to doubt he's one everything else is going to trickle from your doubt and that's why he you know when a minister falls you see the church tend to fall if he does because all the doubt now goes to oh this word he was preaching to us oh he was this that and the other and then the scandal pumps out now there will be some who are going to be spiritually mature enough to say hey that was just him you know God is still good God is still real the truth is still the truth but there's going to be a whole lot of other people that are going to say you know what that's why I don't go to church anyway that's why and that's where in this movie the reason where I say and you know we've got our perspectives on what they could have done but when you leave it just that this is the black church which is what the satire of the movie is trying to say this is the black church and for some it's going to be this is the church you're going to feed into folk who are saying see that that's why I know that's what they all are and they're going to look at every minister through that satirical lens and even like I said the way it ends it's just we're just going to perpetuate this and maybe I don't know the directors I don't know their angle I don't know their faith but maybe that may be where they are or maybe they're speaking to that crowd to hey well need no church you know because that's that's all they're doing to some level it's either about them it's about what they can look like and that's and that's the doubt on a very real sense that the enemy is trying to do just put that doubt in the minds and that's where culture and especially the younger generation leaves God because that's what they see as church what we saw on the movie. Vergra give you final say. Yeah you know I I totally agree with what with what was said in that space with with you guys there I think there's a broader conversation to have around these issues A the black church B church in general the the manner in which pastors should live the manner in which which people of God those who call themselves Christians should carry themselves I think that's a conversation that we have regularly right here on this show you had mentioned earlier that you thought that you know the Hollywood would have allowed this movie to to you know if it weren't nihilistic they wouldn't have allowed it to happen anymore now a day we don't you don't need Hollywood if that was the heart of those who made the movie they could they could have told it that story in that way but but again to the point you made earlier Jason it's irrelevant whether those ladies did or didn't do what we thought they should they made their movie they made their point now it's up to you me and those of us who know how to do better or know that that we should be doing better to absolutely do better and that's what we've got to do. Virgil I'm gonna you've made me brought me to another point this going longer than I I thought but you brought me to another point that's where my disappointment like with the daily wire when they put out their movie terror on the prairie or whatever and and the worst person in that movie was a bible quoting Christian he was the bad guy and so it's just like that's not Hollywood that's the daily wire one to be disruptive it's a bunch of men that are the shot callers basically and they put out a movie that's consistent with the Hollywood narrative and worldview and and and that's where again the culture seems to be in such control of even Christian people or I came to the daily wire Christian I I got to be careful but religious spiritual people are being driven by the culture and maybe they don't even realize it that that and so I just have we have go ahead I think I think the point that you make is a good one we have got to have clear lenses I don't worry about how someone depicts us as Christians because I recognize we're going to be hated by the world I think the point that you make is a good one daily wire the thought is that they're at least Jewish of the Judeo-Christian worldview and so they should depict us in a right way whether they do or don't see irrelevant to guys who have their feet on the ground who are interacting one-to-one with individuals in their culture in their community that are taking a stand for truth at the end of the day we've got to do that and then and then allow God to open doors where platforms are are allow us to say what we want to say the way we want to say it and push forward that's exactly what you're doing here at Feelers that's exactly the reason why folks are gravitating to this platform because they want to hear those kinds of things said in a way that's unapologetic about issues like the gospel about a biblical worldview and so I think there is a space for it we're in it and we just continue to push forward thank you Virgil well end on this note in terms of even if you're not religious I just want to ask you are you really comfortable in a world where there there are no good guys do you really believe that that there is no good and evil there's just people pursuing power by any means necessary and if so if that's the world we're going to create and we're going to have art back up that worldview that's agreeing to everybody's misery and death that that's basically if there is no good and it's just all and if every show and every if all the messaging we're sending to young people is just get that money man get the rest in power get that power get that money there is no higher calling than money in power uh you know your kids are going to live a horrible horrible existence it's going to be far more oppressive and depraved and and destructive than anything we've known certainly in my lifetime because that that is not I grew up believing there were good guys and bad guys and the movies and tv shows James Evans on good times was a good guy so it was Florida Evans and they were fighting the system that was unfair but they were good people that leaned into their faith and I enjoyed that it gave me hope and inspiration because we were poor when good times was on and could see ourselves and that and just like we just leaned in our faith you know maybe my sister will marry a pro football player quarterback for the bears yeah father's Michael I could go to school and say anyway Shameek I'll give you the final say I'm going to though yeah I got a verse oh go ahead yeah and my ma's stem another spark another conversation but I would say I think we do have to have hope and think that there are good people because like you said if not our children will eat very poor lives but I will say that this movie kind of depicts one reason why I don't know if you remember when I first started this show when I say I don't say I'm a Christian I don't just you know walk around like I'm a Christian I'm a Christian I'm a Christian that is one of the reasons why because I feel like people that do that are a poor representation of Christ and so I would rather people decide who I am by my actions opposed to me just walking around and saying this is who I am this is who I am because when I looked at that movie it was not shocking to me because I see it or I've seen it so much the thing I was going to say that's an interesting point you made the one scripture I wanted to get out before we left today James chapter 1 verse 27 James says religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world so if you see that church and you see that worldview and it bothers you seek out the those of God's people seek out the church that is giving help to the helpless giving hope to the hopeless and helping to be anti-cultural we we're counter-cultural we're not doing what everybody else does we're trying to live after God and not live after the world seek after that church and you'll be where God wants you to be all right let's play some harmony and we'll see you tomorrow how did we end up so divided stop fighting in the sandfall we used to be a nation one united now we're headed for downfall we're gonna let you let shine down what we need more than anything now harmony let's make a simple vow let's come together now oh time for us to wake up choose love my sister my brother see through the lies he tells us cast together we're so much stronger time let your light shine down what we need more than anything now harmony let's make a simple vow let's come together now harmony oh you might be sound love on another night oh here is the enemy oh let it get to me open up your eyes and see let's start right now in harmony let's make a simple vow let's come together now harmony oh you might be sound love on another night harmony together together together together yay"
