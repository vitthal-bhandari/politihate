    "text": " Happy Monday, everybody. I'm just going to come right out and say it. I discriminate. I feel like I want to get that off of my chest. I've been thinking about it all weekend, and I want you guys to know that I discriminate. And my question of the day today is, do you discriminate? Let's talk about that. Plus, later on, we're going to be talking about the assisted suicide program. Yeah, that's getting interesting. There is a 65-year-old man in Canada who just applied to die because he's poor. And guess what? A doctor signed off on that. Yep. And more today, coming up on Candace Owens. I'm already feeling lighter now that I've gotten that off of my chest. Yes, I do discriminate. You know, the left does this thing where they take words and they just make them sound bad or they make them sound good. They're very good at linguistics, right? So a bad thing that they make sound good is like abortion. They call it Planned Parenthood. You go, that's lovely. No, but actually they're killing a bunch of infants in the womb. So that's actually not a good thing. And then they all always have these terms. You go, what do they mean? Ciz gender, heteronormative, which basically means that you're not problematic enough. And they kind of try to smear your arrival you on the basis that there's nothing wrong with you enough. And so you're too perfect. You're too normal. And it's called you Ciz gender or whatever. And I've started thinking about this this weekend in terms of the word discrimination. It's become a dirty word. You're not allowed to discriminate. Oh my God, that's discrimination. You shouldn't do that. You should not discriminate. And actually, quite frankly, I think we need to discriminate. I discriminate all the time every single day. And this morning I just shot it out a few examples of when I discriminate. And I'm going to share them with you so that you can feel comfortable sharing your list with your friends. Ready? I'm going to discriminate when I hire. I think that's probably illegal, but who doesn't discriminate when they hire? That wouldn't even make sense. Especially if I'm hiring for childcare. A woman walks through my door and she makes me uncomfortable for any reason at all. It could be any reason I'm not going to hire her. Why would I allow this person who makes me uncomfortable? Watch my children. We should discriminate. Of course, I'm going to discriminate. If she looks like a freak, she can't watch my child. It's that simple. I discriminate also when I hire assistants, right? And I was thinking about the fact that I just had a baby and I was going to be breastfeeding. Probably wasn't a good idea for me to hire a male assistant to be in my home. I wanted to be more comfortable. So I was happy to hire a young female emphasis on the young, by the way. People say it's ageism. You're not allowed to do it. But let me be very clear. If a eight year old's height wants to be my assistant, I go, you know, maybe not the right person that's fit for the job. Considering it's a lot of running around. It's a lot of lifting boxes. There are a lot of things that need to be done. The inverse of that is that for childcare, I actually like older women, right? So I discriminate in favor of somebody who is 65. I quite literally have a woman that helps her on the weekend. She's got nine grandchildren. She's seen it all. I am favorable. I discriminate favorably toward older people that have tons of grandchildren. I feel safer in that way. There are small discrimination. You discriminate when you choose a restaurant. They know that. That's why they built Yelp. People put up their photos. Mm. That doesn't look good. I don't want to eat here. Restaurant looks a little dirty. I don't like the lighting in here. I don't want to eat here. I discriminate. I discriminate when I pick my friends. I look at a girl and I'm just like, she's got something wrong with the eyes. A little crazy in the eyes. I don't know. I just don't want to be friends with her. It just looks like she's unstable. The girl tells me, I take Xanax every time I have a feeling and I go, okay, that's really great. I just don't want to be friends with you. Don't say to them, but I'm thinking it. I'm thinking you seem a little undone. I don't want to be friends with you. I also discriminate when I'm around people and they just have that victim mentality telling you, it's just really hard out there for a black person. Oh, you know how it is being a woman and just like men. I think I don't really know how it is and I don't want to be friends with you because I think a victim mentality is poisonous and I don't want to catch that poison. If it needs to be said, you should discriminate when you date. If he looks like an ax murderer, don't date him. I'm talking about just look, they have a look. I'm like, you do look like you would potentially kill me and hide my body and potentially get away with it. And for that reason, there will not be a second date. It's not simple. By the way, men also discriminate and there are biological reasons for the reason they discriminate. I read this in a book by E.O. Wilson. He also wrote it in papers when they see a woman that has a smaller waist and wide hips, the storied hourglass figure, but it signals to a male is that she has good fertility. It's that simple. I look and they go, I think I could probably get that pregnant and there was something happening in your body that you're thinking about appropriation and they discriminate in favor of a certain shape. And women discriminate too. I don't want to say it. I don't mind saying it. I will say it. You know, I did once date a very short guy and it just felt off. In mind, it was a great relationship. I had a great time with him. But you know, for some reason, you want your other as a woman to be taller than you. And I think men feel that too, right? There are of course examples of shorter men dating supermodels and it's all good. But I think a woman likes to feel small next to a male and a male likes to feel bigger next to a woman. I definitely discriminate against men that paint their nails and wear dresses. I don't really care how you feel about that. You can wear your dress and you can paint your nails. But I'd prefer you keeping a hundred feet away from a playground and all of the feet away from my children and me. If I see you, I'm going to cross the street from with my kids. Oh, can't there just be no accepting? We need to be more accepting of the people, the men who like to wear panties. I'm good. You can be more accepting of it. You run that wrist when you see a guy who looks like a freak and you're with your children and say, to be accepting, I'm going to put my kids next to him. I'm not going to be that person. I'm going to go, that looks weird and I'm going to move away from it. So that's simple. And by the way, speaking of that sort of discrimination, literally any person, no matter how normal they look, if they are at the playground, when I take my kids and they're by them themselves, I'm like, red flag, get my kid away from them. Why are you at the playground by yourself? There's a, there's no scenario where you should just be an adult at a playground by yourself, especially if you're a male, I suddenly have eyes on them and I'm watching them near the other kids. Just feels wrong. It's a healthy discrimination for me. I discriminate against doctors, dentists, trainers. I don't want to dentists with bad teeth. I don't want Lizzo being my trainer. If you wanted to be your trainer, have a bigger trainer. I am going to discriminate against somebody that is that clinically obese, saying that they're going to get me healthy. I am good on that. So all it's to say is obviously discrimination is built into us for a reason. It's a survival mechanism, right? We want to survive. And so when we get that feeling, my mother used to refer to it as the heebie-jeebies. And someone just gives you the heebie-jeebies. Even if you can't quite put your finger on why, I think you need to lean into that. And I actually think that society would be safer if we discriminated more what's happening now as a sanity because it's telling us to accept everything. They say, oh, it's just so fine. He just has a fetish. He likes to wear panties. Who am I talking about? Well, among other people, Sam Brinton, you guys remember this guy? He served as the energy department under the Biden administration, the deputy assistant secretary for spent fuel and waste disposition since June. He's been serving in that position. And if you remember the photos of him, when he was first selected, he looked like a crazy person. In this one photo, he is wearing a long yellow gown and red lipstick. And he's on a orange carpet smiling in this next photo. He is wearing a red dress, a red gown. He has chunky jewelry on again, red lipstick and his bald head. And people were like, oh, my God, diversity. It's amazing. It gets creepier here. He is in stilettos that I wouldn't even wear. Really tall stilettos. It's a sky high thigh slit. He has on bunnies and it looks to be what a playboy shoot. It's got a playboy background. I think it was a playboy shoot. And we're supposed to go, oh, my God, yay. It's so inclusive and I love it. No, when I saw it, I'd like to discriminate against that. Yeah, I wouldn't like my tax dollars to go toward that. I just feel like that person needs to stay away from me and my family. I don't want them any positions of power. I don't want to invest in that in any way, not even with my tax dollars. It turns out that if we had that healthy dose of discrimination as a nation, that person wouldn't have been able to victimize to women because that's what he's done. You'll recall a couple of weeks ago, we covered the fact that he went to an airport, ready? He didn't check in a bag. This is in Minneapolis. He gets on a plane. He lands and then he went to baggage claim and he snatched some young woman's luggage. And he left. I don't know why he did that. The police saw it on tape. They called him and said, hey, did you take someone's luggage? He denied it. Remember, he said, no, I didn't steal any luggage. It wasn't me. Then he called the police back and he said, oh, I may have accidentally taken someone's luggage. Well, that would have been quite the accident considering he didn't check in any baggage. And it was a young woman and he took her stuff probably because he wanted her underwear. You might think, oh, watch weird circumstance. Well, guess what? He did it again. Yep. It has happened again. He did this at the International Airport in Las Vegas. Allegedly stole a suitcase, the total estimated worth of $3,670 on July 6. The police were able to confirm that it was him traveling on that flight with the victim because he posted an Instagram post of himself wearing a shirt that had some atomic symbol on it. And it was in rainbows. And because he posted this on Instagram, they were able to identify him in the footage. Again, he stole from a young woman. He checked the suitcase tag to make sure it was a woman's. And then he took the luggage. Why? Because he's a freak. That's why. Because it's some weird high stakes game. He has weird fetishes. He probably wanted to steal, feel a thrill. Mm, like taking this woman's underwear and all of her stuff and I'm going to put it on home and I'm going to feel good. And if only we as a nation were willing to discriminate, right? When we saw him wearing all those dresses and thigh-high slits, maybe these young women wouldn't have been victimized. All this is, say, ladies and gentlemen, I openly discriminate against weirdos and freaks and I encourage you to do the same. And that's all I have to say about that. All right. If you were listening to my show regularly over the past few weeks and you know that I am partnering with preborn pregnancy clinics to rescue 1500 babies from abortion before the end of this year. And I have great news. We are halfway there. With your help, we have rescued 750 babies so far. Her children works by introducing expecting mothers to their children via ultrasound. When a mother hears her child's heartbeat for the first time, she will, more often than not, choose not to abort that child. I remember the first time that I heard each of my children's heartbeats for the first time. It is an experience I will never forget. Preborn has rescued close to 200,000 babies a day. Their clinics are located in the highest abortion areas in the country where abortions are happening at an alarming rate and they are truly changing and saving lives. Just take a listen to this testimony. When I found out I was pregnant, I was looking at that Dollar Tree pregnancy test and I was absolutely terrified. I encountered a lot of pressure from some people that were telling me to get an abortion. I had a dream before I had my sonogram that I was pregnant with a boy. It was so early. And but in my dream, I just heard a voice say Eli. And then when I came to the Fort Worth pregnancy center and I saw my baby on the sonogram picture, he had a little halo around his head and I heard his heartbeat and I thought, God, I don't know why you picked me. But I'm terrified, but God make a way. It really hit home that, oh my gosh, there's a miracle literally growing inside of my womb. I think if I decided to terminate the pregnancy, my life would have been a lot smaller than it is today, literally and figuratively because walking in faith to continue the pregnancy, despite all odds, has really shown me that God is real. I'm so grateful for the people and the donors that didn't pass judgment and decided to give so that they can give hope in life. It's inspired me to dream big to do big. Such a powerful story. One ultrasound is just $28 or $140 will sponsor five ultrasounds. Now through a match program, your gift is doubled and will save twice as many babies' lives. Any amount that you donate will help, so give the gift of life this holiday season. Donate securely dial pound 250 and say the keyword baby that's pound 250 baby. Or go to preborn.com slash Candace. That's preborn.com slash Candace. Okay, now it's time for some topics to do. All right, so if you listen to this show a lot, you probably know that I discriminate mostly against stupid people. I think that's really where it gets strong. I'm like, this is stupid and people that are stupid are those that perpetuate the trans agenda because it's just so foolish to think that you can magically just change your gender. Why would you believe that? And yet we have so many adults who believe this and who are now victimizing children with this weird, it's almost become a religion, a cult I should say. And there is this ex-navy seal who became famous, probably around, I think it was around 2013, because he decided that he was going to transition from male to female. Of course, you can't do that, but it didn't matter because it was so brave that he came out and said, I've been struggling my whole life and I want to transition and I'm a navy seal and I've been suffering. And this was right about the time that everyone decided that this was a thing. And he even got to do this in an interview with Anderson Cooper because the press celebrates the mainstream media celebrates stupidity all the time. And this has become a dogma where they're propagandizing children to believe this can happen. And now that former navy seal is coming out and saying that it was the worst mistake of his life. And he can't believe people allowed him to do this. Now I want to be clear, his name is Chris Beck. He changed his name when he thought he was transitioning to Kristen Beck. And he was shocked now that he's reflecting to realize that he had been given hormones to transition, which means he had been given hormones to chemically castrate themselves since it's the same drug that they use for chemical castration after a one hour consultation. And this is kind of the same story and the journey that was shared to me from Walt Tire. I talked to you guys a lot about Walt Tire. You should go pursue that long sit down I had with him on a different podcast that I was on where he talked about the same thing. He just had a feeling. He went to the doctor and the doctor said, here, take these drugs. It means that you're a woman. No, it means that you're a human being and you have a feeling and you might be confused doesn't mean that you should be given drugs to help you chemically castrate yourself. Well, Chris Beck did this and now he is out and he is speaking. He spoke to our friend Robbie Starbuck on his podcast. He's basically saying to people, look at me as a warning for what you should not do. He said, quote, everything you see on CNN with my face do not even believe a word of it. Everything that happened to me the last 10 years destroyed my life. I destroyed my life. I'm not a victim. I did this to myself, but I had help. I take full responsibility. I went on CNN and everything else and that's why I'm here right now. I'm trying to correct that. I was used. I was very naive. I was in a really bad way and I got taken advantage of. I got propagandized. I got used badly by a lot of people who had knowledge way beyond me. They knew what they were doing. I didn't. This was during a two hour podcast. He's talking like this and he's talking about this push to normalize a radical. Transgender agenda. I like this interview first and foremost because he's taking full responsibility. It's difficult for me to feel bad. Again, he is today 55 years old. This was back in 2013 where he began this journey. A part of the reason that you're seeing so many people do this is because they get awarded all of this press time and attention by the, I talk about the TikTok community, right? The algorithm saying, oh my gosh, this person is so brave and courageous that we're going to feed this garbage and give them attention. And that attention becomes addicting, obviously. They go, oh, okay, maybe I wasn't known when I was just Navy SEAL. Now, Anderson Cooper wants to sit down and talk to me. And all these people are writing to me saying how brave and how heroic I am. In reality, if these people were well-meaning, they would tell you that you were sick and that this was disturbing and that doctors and nurses are taking advantage of you and then there's a culture that's taking advantage of you. But it's hard to understand that when you're in it and you're getting all that bad attention. Now apply what happened to him to what's going on in the classrooms with children. This is what absolutely infuriates me. And this is why I say to parents who are so fearful, there is this weird thing where I have parents that write to me and they say, I know this is wrong, but I don't want to be that parent, right? My children dropped off at school, they learned that they can pick their gender, but I don't want to be the parents that is angry and at the administration because then the other parents look at me, we're like, I'm not being accepting of these children. And the truth is that you should never be accepting of an ecosystem of evil. The children are victims, right? If suddenly they start to popularize victimizing young children, you need to have the courage to stand up to it. I will be that crazy person. I'm so happy. I will be at the administration every single day. If they teach my child, they can wake up one day and change their gender because these people are in fact child's predators. And not just child predators, of course, because they are adult predators and they are prying on people and their emotions all the time. And I do think that it is a tremendous act of courage when people like Chris Beck and when individuals like Walt Heyer stand up and they realize what they did and they realize what what was wrong about it. They realize that them becoming this emblem, right? People standing up and going, I want to be just like this person because they transitioned is something that they must undo culturally. And he's willing to put in that work, say why he made a mistake and come out and speak about that ecosystem of evil. So kudos to him, be on the alert and a reminder, it's not real bad if you have to go to school and yell at the principal every single day because I already feel that's probably going to be my journey. Guys moving on, you, this story is crazy because you know, I think it was just last week, maybe it was the week before I'm getting my days mixed up, but I covered that journalist Grant Wall and I covered him because he felt the need to wear an LGBTQIA RS flag on his shirt while he was covering the World Cup and Qatar because you know, there's been all these people that are like, I just can't believe that Qatar does not respect our pronouns. And so he thought this was his act of bravery to go ahead and to say, I'm going to wear this flag and the Qatar people were like, nope, not happening. And they basically said you're going to have to take this shirt off if you plan to step into this stadium. And he was livid. He was like, how dare they do this? He like talks about it on Twitter. I just, the authorities have pulled me aside. I'm not allowed to wear this shirt. How dare somebody not allowed me to wear this shirt, what I want to wear to walk into a stadium. That's not freedom. And I talked about it was I thought that's quite ironic and I showed you guys his Twitter feed where he was so pro-vax and pro-mask and he was so pro. How dare you step into a supermarket without a mask? How dare you? Do your job. Go get back stuff. Stay at home. Save lives. Lock yourselves down. And I just said, this is kind of America. We're the opposite extreme. He was happy to be a COVID Nazi when he thought that it served him and now he's upset that they have their own roles that he disagrees with. Well, weird update to that story. That journalist is now dead. He collapsed at the Qatar World Cup. And it is an insane story that we don't have much about it. But I will say he's 49 years old for him to die suddenly and to just collapse while covering Friday's Argentina versus Netherlands match is insane. It begs a lot of questions and of course they're going to say we're all conspiracy theorists because I don't know. I guess today now it's normal for people that are 49 years old and in good shape. He was in good shape to suddenly drop dead. I will add to this that he did say that he had some bronchitis earlier in the week when he was on a podcast, but he was treated for it and presumably feeling healthy enough for him to go and do this match. And he is now dead. It is totally insane. It's that it was and it was towards the end of the extra time in the match. Suddenly colleagues on the left started shouting for medical assistance because somebody had collapsed and they turned over and it was him and he had died. So I just wanted to give you guys that update on that story. We will keep covering it as more comes out. If you owe back taxes to the IRS or have unfiled returns, now is the time to take action. So called inflation reduction act is funding $80 billion to the IRS. The government is weaponizing the IRS by hiring 87,000 more agents. This plan will boost tax collections against the American people like we've never seen before. Tax Network USA is an A plus rated tax firm ready to fight for you.

Moving on, I can't stand that Elon Musk always blows up Twitter on the weekends. I'm trying to relax. Then he's just dropping files. He's just telling us that everybody has been corrupt at Twitter. We already knew that, but things are getting really interesting because he decided to tweet out this. He tweeted, quote, my pronouns are prosecute slash about she. Yeah, it feels like a can of someone's tweet, right? I feel like I've been saying this forever. I'm going to take all the cred for just being so out in the front of this. I never fell for all the COVID conspiracies. I knew that the medical industry was lying. I knew because I'm just very awake to the vaccine lies and I knew that it was all about profits. But for somebody like Elon Musk to say, I'm going to sink $44 billion into buying this company so I can expose all of these lies and to willingly tweet something like prosecute Fauci is stunning. He added to that tweet by saying that he felt that millions of people died and or got sick because of what Fauci did, which was gain of function research. And of course, Fauci should be in prison for the rest of his life. I agree with that. I've always agreed with that. It was such a weird thing to see people treating him like he was a hero. People were actually putting signs in their yard. He was like their lord and savior for a while. It was very creepy. It was very dystopian. The guy that's telling you to stay at home and to not spend time with your dying loved ones. He was telling people, don't go to Thanksgiving. Don't go to Christmas. Let your loved ones die alone. People were like, ah, Fauci. I love Fauci. Thank you, Dr. Fauci. Should I even spend time with my children or should I lock them away? And they're like, ah, thank you so much. It was really, he had cast a spell, especially on leftist. And I think it's because leftism is almost not a misnautotheism. They had no other beliefs. And so it becomes very easy for them to create all of these false idols, whether it's George Floyd or whether it's Dr. Fauci. They just sort of get into it. And that religion is now collapsing. The COVID religion is now collapsing. Everyone's pretending they always knew. Everyone's trying to take street cred now. Like, well, I felt like that wasn't a good idea by the six months I was against the lockdowns. I was always against it because you always have a right to be free. It's that simple. Even if there is actually a virus that will kill you going around, you have the right to go outside and get yourself killed by that virus, right? You are allowed to take those chances and say, actually, I would rather feed my family by going to work and I'm willing to risk being killed. And so I just think it's amazing that Elon Musk is exposing all of this. And of course, people are very, very angry on Twitter. How dare he? That's mocking two people at once. First off, they're the Lord and Savior Fauci. Secondly, the pronouns, guys, these are the freaks. The freaks love their pronouns. They've got so many. They're big and if you can't remember all 37,000 of them, well, first Amy Klobuchar, I think she ran for president. I don't know. Something like that. Yeah, well, she tweeted, I'm a big fan of Dr. Fauci. We bet you are, Amy. And how he's calmly guided our country through a crisis. It's easy to be calm, Amy, when you're treating stocks behind the scenes and making yourself a multi-millionaire through your corruption. She continues. Starting the musk tweet, courting vaccine deniers, that's me, Amy. Doesn't seem like a smart business strategy. But the issue is this, could you just leave a good man alone in your seemingly endless quest for attention? Aw, Amy, who sounds sad? I think Amy is sad. And I think it's brilliant. I just love to see people having a reaction to the truth. They cannot deal with it. They are so comfortable with the lies and they've so ingratiated themselves with those lies. They were the lies. They've perpetuated all of them. These are the people that stood up on a platform and kept telling you that you were a selfish individual for wanting to go home, for wanting to go to work and to make money, for wanting to put food on the table, you were a bad backwards individual. So of course they want to stay face by protecting the image of Fauci. But I will tell you that going into this episode, that tweet, my pronouns are prosecute Fauci, had 200,000 retweets. So I think that is a resounding, the majority of people hate them and we don't really care what people like Amy Klobuchar, who, did she run for president, something like that? What she thinks, nobody cares. Going on another representative, of course these are all Democrats, we're on Twitter. It's America. You can select any pronouns you damn well please. But Anthony Fauci has likely saved more human lives than any living person in the world. Shame on you. I think I just want to go on a dark hole, if you really want to go on a dark rabbit hole, why don't you look up Anthony Fauci and AIDS? That will get really interesting for you. I've been down that dark hole. He definitely has not saved tons of human lives, but he has intentionally done a lot of research that's ended in millions of people dying because there's money. There's money in people being sick. There's money in people dying. There's money in big pharma, constantly having industry of drugs to present to the public. Oh my gosh, we don't know where HIV happened. I think a monkey slept with a scientist. Yeah, actually we're saying this. A monkey slept with a scientist. And so that's what happened. But hey, we've got all these drugs and it's going to keep you alive or make you sick or make you better. So what they understand, the big pharma, it's an evil world, what they understand is that you can make a ton of profit on individuals that are both desperate and scared. So I encourage you not to be desperate and not to be scared and to instead be educated, enough to know that Anthony Fauci is a scumbag. You can quote me directly. And of course, the former CIA director, John Brennan, who should also be in prison. Hope you hear that, John Brennan. You should be in prison for a lot of things. He calls Fauci a national hero, an accused musk of stoking hatred. LOL to anybody that formerly served as the director of the CIA talking about hatred at all. At all. I mean, really, how many bonds do we have to drop in the Middle East? Well, he's like, oh, how dare you send this mean tweet? But also, we're going to drop a few more bombs in the Middle East. How dare you tweet this against pronouns? He said this directly, John Brennan. He said, Dr. Fauci is a national hero. Oh, wait, how do they just keep saying it's almost like they are just, they're on a large like chat, long thread. We're all of them are on it, a group chat. And they're like, let's just say the words national hero. If we say it enough times, it will be true. He says, Dr. Fauci is a national hero who will be remembered for generations to come for his innate goodness and many contributions to public health. Despite your business success, you'll be remembered most for fueling public hate and divisions. You may have money, but you have no class. Money can't buy your class. Okay, John Brennan. Again, I like to remind you, John, you're the former director of the CIA. We don't want to hear about class. We don't want to hear about hate. And we don't want to hear about divisions. In other words, sit this one out. This has been a hard year on the economy. And that means an essential practical gifts will be in high demand this year. And that's why I'm recommending gifting meat and seafood from good ranchers. With discounts on orders of five boxes or more, you can save on gifts for the whole family. When you give a box of good ranchers, you're giving them a true steakhouse experience with 100% American USDA prime and upper choice cuts of beef, chicken, and seafood. When we deliver your company and even your local grocery stores import lower quality meat from overseas, don't give your friends and family less than America's best this year. And if you're not sure what to order, good ranchers now offers gift cards so you can let your friends and family members choose for themselves. Or you can give the gift of a subscription and inflation-proof someone's grocery bill. Go to goodwranchards.com and use code CANIS at checkout to get $35 off your gift. That's goodwranchards.com code CANIS $35 off. Good ranchers. American meat delivered. We're going to move on guys to another story. And I hate to say it. No, I don't hate to say it, but I was right, but I do hate to say that I was right about this particular thing because it just happened so quickly, right? This assisted dying thing. I feel like I said to you, watch this space because they are going to start perpetuating this very quickly because it makes perfect sense when you have people that are relying on so much governance eventually. The government is going to say, let's kill some of them off. And so when they started glamorizing assisted dying and they started using all those buzzwords that this is dying with dignity, right? As they started doing this in Switzerland, I was covering it and going, that's a weird one. And then people in America were like, no, I can understand it, Candace, because I watched somebody die and it's really sad or I know someone who committed suicide, they jumped off a building. It would have been so much better to die of dignity. And I said to yep, that's what they want you to think, but they're going to just start killing people because, I don't know, they just think they're useless. Well, guess what's happened? There is a man in Canada who has, he needs two sign-offs from doctors under the MADE program, the medical assisted, is it medical assistance in dying in death? Something I don't forget what this acronym is for, but that's in Canada. That is the government program. They will assist you in dying. And he through that program, you have to get two signatures from a doctor for them to say, okay, you can die now. Well, he's already gotten one signature. Do you want to know what is wrong with him? His name is Les Landry. He's 65 years old and he is dying of nothing. Nothing. And he is just poor. That's not a joke. That's actually true. Les Landry is just poor. He's awaiting the decision of a second doctor to assess his eligibility to die. And he just wants to die because he's like, you know what, I don't really want to be poor and living, so it would be better for me to just kill myself. In a series of interviews, The Daily Mail, he spoke in detail about this. Here are some quotations from him. He said, made is when the pain of living is more than the fear of death. How do you shut out the switch to both emotional and physical pain in poverty? If poverty takes somebody in a wheelchair and basically makes them homeless, what's the solution? I don't want to go homeless. I don't want to end up living in a van. So I can't make the van payment. I don't want to end up homeless. Who would want to be homeless at 16? Never mind 65. Before I turned 65, I was livable. I wasn't suffering. I had my budget all set out. I know exactly how much I was going to get and it was all manageable. Now it's like, I don't know what I'm going to get from month to month. Sooner or later, it's going to get to a point where I just won't be able to afford to live. Now what did he used to do? He used to be a commercial truck driver and he earned $85,000 per a year. And then he got a hernia. And then there were complications with the treatment of his hernia, which left him with high blood pressure. That high blood pressure in turn triggered three strokes. He developed epilepsy. And so it's been a series of unfortunate events, which led to him losing his driving license and led to him being no longer able to work. Now instead of staying poor or taking welfare handouts, he has decided that he's just going to die. And a doctor or assessment said that's a good enough reason. How dark is that? Could you just imagine this dystopian nightmare where doctors are going to school? We thought it was to keep people alive. Now they're going to people that are being trained to sign off of people dying, just saying your life actually isn't worth it. And the idea that this guy, Les Landry, said, who would even want to report 16? Yeah, it's a good question to ask because that's where it's going to lead. It's going to be a 16-year-old who's going to be like, you know, my pair, I grew up in a group home and I don't want to be alive because I don't have any money. And they're going to further see those ideas. I'm going to call this right now in the education system. They're going to be teaching people in middle school that sometimes people just don't want to live, probably some like cartoon graphics. And it's okay to pick when you want to die because it's dignity. It's dignity and death. Doesn't that sound good? Isn't this all about Buzzwords? Planned Parenthood. Dignity while dying, it's all a nightmare. And I told you it was coming, but it's okay because we're just going to continue to discriminate against the crazies. And that's all I have to say about that. I just want to say that I love reading your guys' comments. I actually hand pick your comments. I go on YouTube. I go on Facebook and they're sometimes just pointedly hilarious. I've plucked some today that are really funny and really interesting. But you guys know that we are already at the end of 30 minutes.
