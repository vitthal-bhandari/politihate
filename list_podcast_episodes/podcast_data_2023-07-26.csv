"6214","Conservative Review with Daniel Horowitz","2023-06-01","pandemic of mental contagion, autism, mass hyper-vaccination, and the rise of transgenderism | 6/1/23","today, we cover some of the most vexing issues of our time with dr. peter mccullough. based on his research, he has developed a theory that in addition to the cultural grooming, gender dysphoria has been turbocharged by the rise of autism, and the bad actors in culture and medicine preying upon vulnerability. he posits that the autistic are already more susceptible to this sort of mental illness, and when they are pumped up with excess testosterone, it also leads to more violence. there is a growing trend ignored by the media of those who have gone through gender mutilation committing mass shootings. but what is causing all of this autism? while there might be multiple factors, dr. mccullough believes it is inescapable that mass hyper-vaccination with so many inflammatory shots at once raises one’s risk for autism. as always, he brings the receipts on the academic literature he cites. we discuss the need to audit all the vaccines, stop the new ones, abolish the concept of a childhood schedule, and certainly end mandates and liability waivers for shots.  learn more about your ad choices. visit megaphone.fm/adchoices","More Conservative","News","Apple Recommendation","https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/pdst.fm/e/pfx.vpixl.com/4V6da/arttrk.com/p/BLZM1/chtbl.com/track/384GD8/verifi.podscribe.com/rss/p/traffic.megaphone.fm/BMDC3983419077.mp3?updated=1685639852"
