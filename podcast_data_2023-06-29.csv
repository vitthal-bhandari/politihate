16262,Mark Levin Podcast,09-01-2021,mark levin audio rewind - 1/8/21,"on friday's mark levin show, free speech is under attack. twitter has suspended president trump's account indefinitely and apple is threatening to suspend parler from its app store. parler investor dan bongino joins the show to explain how today's digital town square is under siege. publishers like the new york times are liable for what they publish. platforms like twitter and parler are currently exempt from liability due to section 230. the left favors monopolies and hates competition. so in response to the fascistic policies at twitter, mark levin has voluntarily suspended its twitter account. then, in one of nancy pelosi's last political breaths, she and the democrats are now insisting on impeaching trump for a second time falsely claiming that he has called an insurrection on capitol hill. yet, pelosi incited an insurrection calling federal police ""storm troopers"" and assaulted our constitution by allowing the attack on federal courts. kamala harris called for continued riots this summer, should she be impeached too? marxist progressivism is incompatible with constitutionalism. marxists reject the principles of god-given rights, private property, and the founding of our country. tens of millions of americans support our country, the constitution, and president trump who won the white house in 2016, fair and square. their goal is to silence all dissent and weaken our liberties like free speech and self-protection. constitutionalists reject violence, and the neo-marxists welcome the overturning of america's constitutional system. later, jason whitlock, founder of the sports and culture website outkick, agrees that trump was part of the reason for wednesday's chaos, but that it wasn't solely trump. whitlock added that trump supporters have been ostracized and that big tech and others are drunk on the power they have. learn more about your ad choices. visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",More Conservative,News,Apple Top 100,https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/pdst.fm/e/chtbl.com/track/8G441/traffic.megaphone.fm/WWO3948864962.mp3
16263,Mark Levin Podcast,08-01-2021,mark levin audio rewind - 1/7/21,"on thursday's mark levin show, nothing has changed in the last 24 hours following the capitol building siege, yet democrats and republicans alike are turning on president trump. some going as far as calling for the removal of the president in his last 13 days in office by way of the 25th amendment, as well as threats of another impeachment. plus, cabinet secretary elaine chao has announced her resignation just eight days shy of the administration's end.  the media is falsely claiming that trump incited an insurrection. these vile remarks by the media are cancerous to our republic. one publisher has gone as far as canceling the book deal of one republican senator for his support of the constitution at yesterday's electoral vote count and certification.  later, the double standard of the democrats and rino’s for only calling out violence when they don’t agree is appalling. the fact is president trump did not make any calls for violence, period. afterward, ben domenech of the federalist calls in to discuss the consequences of the capitol assault. learn more about your ad choices. visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",More Conservative,News,Apple Top 100,https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/pdst.fm/e/chtbl.com/track/8G441/traffic.megaphone.fm/WWO2902854704.mp3
16264,Mark Levin Podcast,07-01-2021,mark levin audio rewind - 1/6/21,"on wednesday's mark levin show, anarchy is not to be accepted and those that broke into the capitol building are lucky they were not all shot upon breaking the doors and rushing into the building. this violence must be denounced not excused. storming the capital building was stupid and accomplished nothing. all this does is give the left and the media fodder for their attack on president trump and conservatives. meanwhile, the hundreds of thousands of people that assembled did not storm the capital but peacefully assembled. all summer long antifa was criticized by conservatives for their attacks on federal buildings and anyone breaching the capitol must be equally criticized. there is no defense for people that take it amongst themselves to break the law and break into congress. then, the media is desperately trying to tie the president to this violence. the mob that breached the capitol building does not represent all of the supporters that peaceably assembled in support of trump. challenging the electoral count is worthy of the time it takes on the floor of congress to deliberate. later, the senators fulfilling their duty by objecting to the electoral college vote count are not to blame for the actions of an unscrupulous few. ideas have consequences but arguments based on principles are important. the pennsylvania state legislature has requested that congress stop counting their electors' votes because of new information obtained and their inability to convene because they are statutorily out of session.   learn more about your ad choices. visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",More Conservative,News,Apple Top 100,https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/pdst.fm/e/chtbl.com/track/8G441/traffic.megaphone.fm/WWO7915342761.mp3
16265,Mark Levin Podcast,06-01-2021,mark levin audio rewind - 1/5/21,"on tuesday's mark levin show, the country is crumbling because the neo-marxists and statists have been relentlessly attacking our constitutional system for over a decade. the vast majority of republicans in congress are affixing their seal of approval to this lawlessness. surrender is not an option; we have future generations of our families and men and women in uniform that are counting on america. the media, the democrats, and establishment republicans want every american to roll over and accept this. each american must reject this new 'squad' of radicals and become their own paul revere. then, the framers rejected the judiciary having a role in the selection of the president of the united states and precisely opted for what they outlined in article ii, section i granting all authority over the selection of the electors for the president to each state's legislature. this was done specifically to prevent state executive or the courts from being involved in the selection of the electors for the presidency. later, the lawyers representing the republicans in the pennsylvania state legislature are the same lawyers representing mitch mcconnell via the national republican senatorial committee. the national republican establishment is diabolical and wants all gop votes but not the voters' input. this is one very deep swamp.   learn more about your ad choices. visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",More Conservative,News,Apple Top 100,https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/pdst.fm/e/chtbl.com/track/8G441/traffic.megaphone.fm/WWO4843879969.mp3
16266,Mark Levin Podcast,05-01-2021,mark levin audio rewind - 1/4/21,"on monday's mark levin show, the constitution was systematically targeted and attacked by those in the democrat party who embrace the 1619 project. the radical extreme left hates the constitution and wants to eviscerate it because it prevents the grandiosity and power they seek. if america has a democrat party that has circumvented article 2 sec 2 of the constitution, should those electors' votes be counted even though they're tainted because those states chose to not comply with the federal constitution? of course not, because willfully and brazenly changing election laws outside of the federal constitution violates the constitutional election process in that state. then, no member of congress may be sworn in without taking an oath to defend the constitution. therefore, it is understood that the votes counted must be obtained constitutionally. ""shall"" count does not mean that congress is compelled to count votes that were cast extra-constitutionally. later, five nerds at the wall street journal editorial board just normalized and conflated the spying on the trump campaign with the fraud being legitimately challenged in congress. afterward, sen. ted cruz joins the show to reiterate why the constitution outlines how a constitutional challenge should be conducted by the vice president and congress. learn more about your ad choices. visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",More Conservative,News,Apple Top 100,https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/pdst.fm/e/chtbl.com/track/8G441/traffic.megaphone.fm/WWO3274553457.mp3?updated=1609814986
